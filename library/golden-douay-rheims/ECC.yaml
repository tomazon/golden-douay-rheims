      v:011: 'ECC:2:11 | 11 | 11 | And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had wrought, and to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain, I saw in all things vanity, and vexation of mind, and that nothing was lasting under the sun.{VS:VERSE:END}{VS:P}'
      v:012: 'ECC:2:12 | 12 | 12 | {VS:VERSE:BEGIN}I passed further to behold wisdom, and errors and folly, (What is man, said I that he can follow the King his maker?){VS:BR}'

      v:021: 'ECC:2:21 | 21 | 21 | For when a man laboureth in wisdom, and knowledge, and carefulness, he leaveth what he hath gotten to an idle man: so this also is vanity, and a great evil.{VS:BR}'
