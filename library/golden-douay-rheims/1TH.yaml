    verses:
      v:001: '1TH:2:1 | 1 | 1 | For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:'
      v:002: '1TH:2:2 | 2 | 2 | But having suffered many things before and been shamefully treated, (as you know) at Philippi, we had confidence in our God, to speak unto you the gospel of God in much carefulness.'
      v:003: '1TH:2:3 | 3 | 3 | For our exhortation was not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deceit.'
      v:004: '1TH:2:4 | 4 | 4 | But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be committed to us: even so we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who proveth our hearts.'
      v:005: '1TH:2:5 | 5 | 5 | For neither have we used at any time the speech of flattery, as you know: nor taken an occasion of covetousness (God is witness):'
      v:006: '1TH:2:6 | 6 | 6 | Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others.'
      v:007: '1TH:2:7 | 7 | 7 | Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the apostles of Christ: but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse should cherish her children:'
      v:008: '1TH:2:8 | 8 | 8 | So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls: because you were become most dear unto us.'
      v:009: '1TH:2:9 | 9 | 9 | For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached among you the gospel of God.'
      v:010: '1TH:2:10 | 10 | 10 | You are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and without blame we have been to you that have believed:'
      v:011: '1TH:2:11 | 11 | 11 | As you know in what manner, entreating and comforting you (as a father doth his children),'
      v:012: '1TH:2:12 | 12 | 12 | We testified to every one of you that you would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.{VS:P}'
      v:013: '1TH:2:13 | 13 | 13 | Therefore, we also give thanks to God without ceasing: because, that when you had received of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the word of God, who worketh in you that have believed.'
      v:014: '1TH:2:14 | 14 | 14 | For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they have from the Jews:'
      v:015: '1TH:2:15 | 15 | 15 | Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and have persecuted us, and please not God, and are adversaries to all men;'
      v:016: '1TH:2:16 | 16 | 16 | Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath of God is come upon them to the end.'
      v:017: '1TH:2:17 | 17 | 17 | But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in sight, not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.'
      v:018: '1TH:2:18 | 18 | 18 | For we would have come unto you, I Paul indeed, once and again: but Satan hath hindered us.'
      v:019: '1TH:2:19 | 19 | 19 | For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory? Are not you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?'
      v:020: 1TH:2:20 | 20 | 20 | For you are our glory and joy.

      v:007: '1TH:3:7 | 7 | 7 | Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your faith.'
      v:008: '1TH:3:8 | 8 | 8 | Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.'
      v:009: '1TH:3:9 | 9 | 9 | For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,'
      v:010: 1TH:3:10 | 10 | 10 | Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?
      v:011: '1TH:3:11 | 11 | 11 | Now God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.'

      v:010: '1TH:4:10 | 10 | 10 | For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia. But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound more:'
      v:011: "1TH:4:11 | 11 | 11 | And that you use your endeavour to be quiet: and that you do your own business and work with your own hands, as we commanded you: and that you walk honestly towards them that are without: and that you want nothing of any man's."

intro: 'Thessalonica was the capital of Macedonia, in which St. Paul, having preached the Gospel, converted some Jews and a great number of the Gentiles: but the unbelieving Jews, envying his success, raised such a commotion against him that he, and his companion, Sylvanus were obliged to quit the city. Afterwards he went to Athens, where he heard that the converts in Thessalonica were under a severe persecution, ever since his departure; and lest they should lose their fortitude, he sent Timothy to strengthen and comfort them in their sufferings. In the meantime St. Paul came to Corinth, where he wrote this first Epistle, and also the second to the Thessalonians, both in the same year, being the nineteenth after our Lord’s Ascension. These are the first of his Epistles in the order of time.'
