      v:002: '1JN:4:2 | 2 | 2 | By this is the spirit of God known. Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:'
      v:003: '1JN:4:3 | 3 | 3 | And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus is not of God. And this is Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he cometh: and he is now already in the world.'
      v:004: '1JN:4:4 | 4 | 4 | You are of God, little children, and have overcome him. Because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.'

      v:006: '1JN:4:6 | 6 | 6 | We are of God. He that knoweth God heareth us. He that is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.{VS:P}'

      v:009: '1JN:4:9 | 9 | 9 | By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by him.'
      v:010: '1JN:4:10 | 10 | 10 | In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but because he hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.'
      v:011: '1JN:4:11 | 11 | 11 | My dearest, if God hath so loved us, we also ought to love one another.'
      v:012: '1JN:4:12 | 12 | 12 | No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us: and his charity is perfected in us.'

      v:019: '1JN:4:19 | 19 | 19 | Let us therefore love God: because God first hath loved us.'
      v:020: '1JN:4:20 | 20 | 20 | If any man say: I love God, and hateth his brother; he is a liar. for he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth not?'
      v:021: '1JN:4:21 | 21 | 21 | And this commandment we have from God, that he who loveth God love also his brother.'

      v:014: '1JN:5:14 | 14 | 14 | And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us.'
      v:015: '1JN:5:15 | 15 | 15 | And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we have the petitions which we request of him.'
      v:016: '1JN:5:16 | 16 | 16 | He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him ask: and life shall be given to him who sinneth not to death. There is a sin unto death. for that I say not that any man ask.'

intro: 'The same vein of divine love and charity towards our neighbour, which runs throughout the Gospel written by the beloved disciple and Evangelist, St. John, is found also in his Epistles. He confirms the two principal mysteries of faith: The mystery of the Trinity and the mystery of the incarnation of Jesus Christ the Son of God. The sublimity and excellence of the evangelical doctrine he declares: And this commandment we have from God, that he, who loveth God, love also his brother (chap. 4,21). And again: For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments, and: His commandments are not heavy (chap. 5,3). He shews how to distinguish the children of God from those of the devil: marks out those who should be called Antichrists: describes the turpitude and gravity of sin. Finally, he shews how the sinner may hope for pardon. It was written, according to Baronius’ account, sixty-six years after our Lord’s Ascension.'
