      v:006: COL:1:6 | 6 | 6 | Which is come unto you, as also it is in the whole
        world and bringeth forth fruit and groweth, even as it doth in you, since
        the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth.
      v:007: COL:1:7 | 7 | 7 | As you learned of Epaphras, our most beloved fellow
        servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ Jesus;

        of his glory, in all patience and longsuffering with joy,
      v:012: 'COL:1:12 | 12 | 12 | Giving thanks to God the Father, who hath made

      v:013: COL:1:13 | 13 | 13 | Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness

      v:014: 'COL:1:14 | 14 | 14 | In whom we have redemption through his blood, the

      v:015: 'COL:1:15 | 15 | 15 | Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn
        of every creature:'
      v:016: COL:1:16 | 16 | 16 | For in him were all things created in heaven and
        on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities,
        or powers. All things were created by him and in him.
      v:017: 'COL:1:17 | 17 | 17 | And he is before all: and by him all things consist.'
      v:018: 'COL:1:18 | 18 | 18 | And he is the head of the body, the church: who
        is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he may hold

      v:019: 'COL:1:19 | 19 | 19 | Because in him, it hath well pleased the Father
        that all fulness should dwell:'
      v:020: COL:1:20 | 20 | 20 | And through him to reconcile all things unto himself,
        making peace through the blood of his cross, both as to the things that are
        on earth and the things that are in heaven.
      v:021: 'COL:1:21 | 21 | 21 | And you, whereas you were some time alienated and
        enemies in mind in evil works:'
      v:022: 'COL:1:22 | 22 | 22 | Yet now he hath reconciled in the body of his flesh
        through death, to present you holy and unspotted and blameless before him:'
      v:023: 'COL:1:23 | 23 | 23 | If so ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled,
        and immoveable from the hope of the gospel which you have heard, which is
        preached in all the creation that is under heaven: whereof I Paul am made
        a minister.'
      v:024: 'COL:1:24 | 24 | 24 | Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill
        up those things that are wanting of the sufferings of Christ, in my flesh,
        for his body, which is the church:'

        generations, but now is manifested to his saints,
      v:027: COL:1:27 | 27 | 27 | To whom God would make known the riches of the glory
        of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ, in you the hope of glory.
      v:028: COL:1:28 | 28 | 28 | Whom we preach, admonishing every man and teaching
        every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.

  c:002:
    intro: He warns them against the impostures of the philosophers and the Jewish
      teachers, that would withdraw them from Christ.
    verses:
      v:001: 'COL:2:1 | 1 | 1 | For I would have you know what manner of care I have
        for you and for them that are at Laodicea and whosoever have not seen my face
        in the flesh:'
      v:002: 'COL:2:2 | 2 | 2 | That their hearts may be comforted, being instructed
        in charity and unto all riches of fulness of understanding, unto the knowledge
        of the mystery of God the Father and of Christ Jesus:'
      v:003: COL:2:3 | 3 | 3 | In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
      v:004: COL:2:4 | 4 | 4 | Now this I say, that no man may deceive you by loftiness
        of words.
      v:005: COL:2:5 | 5 | 5 | For though I be absent in body, yet in spirit I am
        with you, rejoicing, and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your
        faith which is in Christ.
      v:006: 'COL:2:6 | 6 | 6 | As therefore you have received Jesus Christ the Lord,
        walk ye in him:'
      v:007: 'COL:2:7 | 7 | 7 | Rooted and built up in him and confirmed in the faith,
        as also you have learned: abounding in him in thanksgiving.'
      v:008: 'COL:2:8 | 8 | 8 | Beware lest any man cheat you by philosophy and vain
        deceit: according to the tradition of men according to the elements of the
        world and not according to Christ.'
      v:009: COL:2:9 | 9 | 9 | For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead
        corporeally.
      v:010: COL:2:10 | 10 | 10 | And you are filled in him, who is the head of all
        principality and power.
      v:011: 'COL:2:11 | 11 | 11 | In whom also you are circumcised with circumcision
        not made by hand in despoiling of the body of the flesh: but in the circumcision
        of Christ.'
      v:012: 'COL:2:12 | 12 | 12 | Buried with him in baptism: in whom also you are
        risen again by the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him up from
        the dead.'
      v:013: 'COL:2:13 | 13 | 13 | And you, when you were dead in your sins and the
        uncircumcision of your flesh, he hath quickened together with him, forgiving
        you all offences:'
      v:014: COL:2:14 | 14 | 14 | Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that
        was against us, which was contrary to us. And he hath taken the same out of
        the way, fastening it to the cross.
      v:015: COL:2:15 | 15 | 15 | And despoiling the principalities and powers, he
        hath exposed them confidently in open shew, triumphing over them in himself.
      v:016: COL:2:16 | 16 | 16 | Let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink
        or in respect of a festival day or of the new moon or of the sabbaths,
      v:017: 'COL:2:17 | 17 | 17 | Which are a shadow of things to come: but the body
        is of Christ.'
      v:018: 'COL:2:18 | 18 | 18 | Let no man seduce you, willing in humility and
        religion of angels, walking in the things which he hath not seen, in vain
        puffed up by the sense of his flesh:'
      v:019: COL:2:19 | 19 | 19 | And not holding the head, from which the whole body,
        by joints and bands, being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth
        into the increase of God.
      v:020: COL:2:20 | 20 | 20 | If then you be dead with Christ from the elements
        of this world, why do you yet decree as though living in the world?
      v:021: 'COL:2:21 | 21 | 21 | Touch not: taste not: handle not.'
      v:022: COL:2:22 | 22 | 22 | Which all are unto destruction by the very use,
        according to the precepts and doctrines of men.
      v:023: COL:2:23 | 23 | 23 | Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in superstition
        and humility, and not sparing the body; not in any honour to the filling of
        the flesh.

        that are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.
      v:002: COL:3:2 | 2 | 2 | Mind the things that are above, not the things that
        are upon the earth.
      v:003: 'COL:3:3 | 3 | 3 | For you are dead: and your life is hid with Christ
        in God.'
      v:004: COL:3:4 | 4 | 4 | When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you
        also shall appear with him in glory.
      v:005: 'COL:3:5 | 5 | 5 | Mortify therefore your members which are upon the
        earth: fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence and covetousness,
        which is the service of idols.'
      v:006: COL:3:6 | 6 | 6 | For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children
        of unbelief.

        in them.
      v:008: 'COL:3:8 | 8 | 8 | But now put you also all away: anger, indignation,
        malice, blasphemy, filthy speech out of your mouth.'
      v:009: 'COL:3:9 | 9 | 9 | Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the
        old man with his deeds,'

        knowledge, according to the image of him that created him.
      v:011: COL:3:11 | 11 | 11 | Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision
        nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all
        and in all.
      v:012: 'COL:3:12 | 12 | 12 | Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy
        and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience:'
      v:013: COL:3:13 | 13 | 13 | Bearing with one another and forgiving one another,
        if any have a complaint against another. Even as the Lord hath forgiven you,
        so do you also.
      v:014: COL:3:14 | 14 | 14 | But above all these things have charity, which is
        the bond of perfection.

        in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father
        by him.
      v:018: COL:3:18 | 18 | 18 | Wives, be subject to your husbands, as it behoveth

        heart, fearing God.'
      v:023: 'COL:3:23 | 23 | 23 | Whatsoever you do, do it from the heart, as to
        the Lord, and not to men:'

intro: Colossa was a city of Phrygia, near Laodicea. It does not appear that St. Paul
  had preached there himself, but that the Colossians were converted by Epaphras,
  a disciple of the Apostles. However, as St. Paul was the great Apostle of the Gentiles,
  he wrote this Epistle to the Colossians when he was in prison, and about the same
  time that he wrote to the Ephesians and Philippians. The exhortations and doctrine
  it contains are similar to that which is set forth in his Epistle to the Ephesians.
