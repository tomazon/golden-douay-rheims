        him, to make known to his servants the things which must shortly come to pass:
        and signified, sending by his angel to his servant John,'
      v:002: REV:1:2 | 2 | 2 | Who hath given testimony to the word of God and the

        be unto you and peace, from him that is and that was and that is to come:

      v:005: REV:1:5 | 5 | 5 | And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness,
        the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth, who
        hath loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
      v:006: REV:1:6 | 6 | 6 | And hath made us a kingdom, and priests to God and
        his Father. To him be glory and empire for ever and ever. Amen.
      v:007: 'REV:1:7 | 7 | 7 | Behold, he cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall
        see him: and they also that pierced him. And all the tribes of the earth shall
        bewail themselves because of him. Even so. Amen.'
      v:008: REV:1:8 | 8 | 8 | I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, saith

        and in the kingdom and patience in Christ Jesus, was in the island which is
        called Patmos, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus.
      v:010: REV:1:10 | 10 | 10 | I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard
        behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,
      v:011: 'REV:1:11 | 11 | 11 | Saying: What thou seest, write in a book and send
        to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamus
        and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.'
      v:012: 'REV:1:12 | 12 | 12 | And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me.
        And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks:'
      v:013: REV:1:13 | 13 | 13 | And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks,
        one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girt
        about the paps with a golden girdle.
      v:014: 'REV:1:14 | 14 | 14 | And his head and his hairs were white as white
        wool and as snow. And his eyes were as a flame of fire:'
      v:015: REV:1:15 | 15 | 15 | And his feet like unto fine brass, as in a burning
        furnace. And his voice as the sound of many waters.
      v:016: REV:1:16 | 16 | 16 | And he had in his right hand seven stars. And from
        his mouth came out a sharp two-edged sword. And his face was as the sun shineth
        in his power.
      v:017: 'REV:1:17 | 17 | 17 | And when I had seen him, I fell at his feet as
        dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying: Fear not. I am the First
        and the Last,'
      v:018: REV:1:18 | 18 | 18 | And alive, and was dead. And behold I am living
        for ever and ever and have the keys of death and of hell.
      v:019: 'REV:1:19 | 19 | 19 | Write therefore the things which thou hast seen:
        and which are: and which must be done hereafter.'
      v:020: REV:1:20 | 20 | 20 | The mystery of the seven stars, which thou sawest
        in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the
        angels of the seven churches. And the seven candlesticks are the seven churches.

      and Thyatira.
    verses:
      v:001: 'REV:2:1 | 1 | 1 | Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write: These
        things saith he who holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh
        in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:'
      v:002: 'REV:2:2 | 2 | 2 | I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and
        how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say
        they are apostles and are not: and hast found them liars:'
      v:003: REV:2:3 | 3 | 3 | And thou hast patience and hast endured for my name
        and hast not fainted.
      v:004: REV:2:4 | 4 | 4 | But I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast
        left thy first charity.
      v:005: 'REV:2:5 | 5 | 5 | Be mindful therefore from whence thou art fallen:
        and do penance and do the first works. Or else I come to thee and will move
        thy candlestick out of its place, except thou do penance.'
      v:006: REV:2:6 | 6 | 6 | But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
        Nicolaites, which I also hate.
      v:007: 'REV:2:7 | 7 | 7 | He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith
        to the churches: To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of
        life which is in the paradise of my God.'
      v:008: 'REV:2:8 | 8 | 8 | And to the angel of the church of Smyrna write: These
        things saith the First and the Last, who was dead and is alive:'
      v:009: 'REV:2:9 | 9 | 9 | I know thy tribulation and thy poverty: but thou art
        rich. And thou art blasphemed by them that say they are Jews and are not,
        but are the synagogue of Satan.'
      v:010: 'REV:2:10 | 10 | 10 | Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer.
        Behold, the devil will cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried:
        and you shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death: and
        I will give thee the crown of life.'
      v:011: 'REV:2:11 | 11 | 11 | He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
        saith to the churches: He that shall overcome shall not be hurt by the second
        death.'
      v:012: 'REV:2:12 | 12 | 12 | And to the angel of the church of Pergamus write:
        These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword:'
      v:013: REV:2:13 | 13 | 13 | I know where thou dwellest, where the seat of Satan
        is. And thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith. Even in those
        days when Antipas was my faithful witness, who was slain among you, where
        Satan dwelleth.
      v:014: 'REV:2:14 | 14 | 14 | But I have against thee a few things: because thou
        hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balac to cast
        a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat and to commit fornication.'
      v:015: REV:2:15 | 15 | 15 | So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of
        the Nicolaites.
      v:016: REV:2:16 | 16 | 16 | In like manner do penance. If not, I will come to
        thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
      v:017: 'REV:2:17 | 17 | 17 | He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
        saith to the churches: To him that overcometh I will give the hidden manna
        and will give him a white counter: and in the counter, a new name written,
        which no man knoweth but he that receiveth it.'
      v:018: 'REV:2:18 | 18 | 18 | And to the angel of the church of Thyatira write:
        These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like to a flame of fire
        and his feet like to fine brass.'
      v:019: REV:2:19 | 19 | 19 | I know thy works and thy faith and thy charity and
        thy ministry and thy patience and thy last works, which are more than the
        former.
      v:020: 'REV:2:20 | 20 | 20 | But I have against thee a few things: because thou
        sufferest the woman Jezabel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and
        to seduce my servants, to commit fornication and to eat of things sacrificed
        to idols.'
      v:021: 'REV:2:21 | 21 | 21 | And I gave her a time that she might do penance:
        and she will not repent of her fornication.'
      v:022: 'REV:2:22 | 22 | 22 | Behold, I will cast her into a bed: and they that
        commit adultery with her shall be in very great tribulation, except they do
        penance from their deeds,'
      v:023: 'REV:2:23 | 23 | 23 | And I will kill her children with death: and all
        the churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts.
        And I will give to every one of you according to your works. But to you I
        say,'
      v:024: 'REV:2:24 | 24 | 24 | And to the rest who are at Thyatira: Whosoever
        have not this doctrine and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they
        say: I will not put upon you any other burthen.'
      v:025: REV:2:25 | 25 | 25 | Yet that which you have, hold fast till I come.
      v:026: REV:2:26 | 26 | 26 | And he that shall overcome and keep my works unto
        the end, I will give him power over the nations.
      v:027: 'REV:2:27 | 27 | 27 | And he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and
        as the vessel of a potter they shall be broken:'
      v:028: REV:2:28 | 28 | 28 | As I also have received of my Father. And I will
        give him the morning star.
      v:029: REV:2:29 | 29 | 29 | He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
        saith to the churches.

    intro: Directions what to write to Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.
    verses:
      v:001: 'REV:3:1 | 1 | 1 | And to the angel of the church of Sardis write: These
        things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the seven stars: I
        know thy works, that thou hast the name of being alive. And thou art dead.'
      v:002: REV:3:2 | 2 | 2 | Be watchful and strengthen the things that remain,
        which are ready to die. for I find not thy works full before my God.
      v:003: 'REV:3:3 | 3 | 3 | Have in mind therefore in what manner thou hast received
        and heard: and observe and do penance: If then thou shalt not watch, I will
        come to thee as a thief: and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come
        to thee.'
      v:004: 'REV:3:4 | 4 | 4 | But thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not
        defiled their garments: and they shall walk with me in white, because they
        are worthy.'
      v:005: 'REV:3:5 | 5 | 5 | He that shall overcome shall thus be clothed in white
        garments: and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life. And I
        will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.'
      v:006: REV:3:6 | 6 | 6 | He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
        to the churches.
      v:007: 'REV:3:7 | 7 | 7 | And to the angel of the church of Philadelphia write:
        These things saith the Holy One and the true one, he that hath the key of
        David, he that openeth and no man shutteth, shutteth and no man openeth:'
      v:008: 'REV:3:8 | 8 | 8 | I know thy works. Behold, I have given before thee
        a door opened, which no man can shut: because thou hast a little strength
        and hast kept my word and hast not denied my name.'
      v:009: REV:3:9 | 9 | 9 | Behold, I will bring of the synagogue of Satan, who
        say they are Jews and are not, but do lie. Behold, I will make them to come
        and adore before thy feet. And they shall know that I have loved thee.
      v:010: REV:3:10 | 10 | 10 | Because thou hast kept the word of my patience,
        I will also keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon the
        whole world to try them that dwell upon the earth.
      v:011: 'REV:3:11 | 11 | 11 | Behold, I come quickly: hold fast that which thou
        hast, that no man take thy crown.'
      v:012: 'REV:3:12 | 12 | 12 | He that shall overcome, I will make him a pillar
        in the temple of my God: and he shall go out no more. And I will write upon
        him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem,
        which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and my new name.'
      v:013: REV:3:13 | 13 | 13 | He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
        saith to the churches.
      v:014: 'REV:3:14 | 14 | 14 | And to the angel of the church of Laodicea write:
        These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, who is the beginning
        of the creation of God:'
      v:015: REV:3:15 | 15 | 15 | I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor
        hot. I would thou wert cold or hot.
      v:016: REV:3:16 | 16 | 16 | But because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor
        hot, I will begin to vomit thee out of my mouth.
      v:017: 'REV:3:17 | 17 | 17 | Because thou sayest: I am rich and made wealthy
        and have need of nothing: and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable
        and poor and blind and naked.'
      v:018: 'REV:3:18 | 18 | 18 | I counsel thee to buy of me gold, fire tried, that
        thou mayest be made rich and mayest be clothed in white garments: and that
        the shame of thy nakedness may not appear. And anoint thy eyes with eyesalve,
        that thou mayest see.'
      v:019: REV:3:19 | 19 | 19 | Such as I love, I rebuke and chastise. Be zealous
        therefore and do penance.
      v:020: 'REV:3:20 | 20 | 20 | Behold, I stand at the gate and knock. If any man
        shall hear my voice and open to me the door, I will come in to him and will
        sup with him: and he with me.'
      v:021: 'REV:3:21 | 21 | 21 | To him that shall overcome, I will give to sit
        with me in my throne: as I also have overcome and am set down with my Father
        in his throne.'
      v:022: REV:3:22 | 22 | 22 | He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
        saith to the churches.
  c:004:
    intro: The vision of the throne of God, the twenty-four ancients and the four
      living creatures.
    verses:
      v:001: 'REV:4:1 | 1 | 1 | After these things I looked, and behold a door was
        opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard, as it were, of a trumpet
        speaking with me, said: Come up hither, and I will shew thee the things which
        must be done hereafter.'
      v:002: REV:4:2 | 2 | 2 | And immediately I was in the spirit. And behold, there
        was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne one sitting.
      v:003: REV:4:3 | 3 | 3 | And he that sat was to the sight like the jasper and
        the sardine stone. And there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight
        like unto an emerald.
      v:004: 'REV:4:4 | 4 | 4 | And round about the throne were four and twenty seats:
        and upon the seats, four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in white garments.
        And on their heads were crowns of gold.'
      v:005: REV:4:5 | 5 | 5 | And from the throne proceeded lightnings and voices
        and thunders. And there were seven lamps burning before the throne, which
        are the seven spirits of God.
      v:006: 'REV:4:6 | 6 | 6 | And in the sight of the throne was, as it were, a
        sea of glass like to crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about
        the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes before and behind.'
      v:007: 'REV:4:7 | 7 | 7 | And the first living creature was like a lion: and
        the second living creature like a calf: and the third living creature, having
        the face, as it were, of a man: and the fourth living creature was like an
        eagle flying.'
      v:008: 'REV:4:8 | 8 | 8 | And the four living creatures had each of them six
        wings: and round about and within they are full of eyes. And they rested not
        day and night, saying: Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, who was and who
        is and who is to come.'
      v:009: 'REV:4:9 | 9 | 9 | And when those living creatures gave glory and honour
        and benediction to him that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for ever and
        ever:'
      v:010: 'REV:4:10 | 10 | 10 | The four and twenty ancients fell down before him
        that sitteth on the throne and adored him that liveth for ever and ever and
        cast their crowns before the throne, saying:'
      v:011: 'REV:4:11 | 11 | 11 | Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory
        and honour and power. Because thou hast created all things: and for thy will
        they were and have been created.'
  c:005:
    intro: The book sealed with seven seals is opened by the Lamb, who thereupon receives
      adoration and praise from all.
    verses:
      v:001: REV:5:1 | 1 | 1 | And I saw, in the right hand of him that sat on the
        throne, a book, written within and without, sealed with seven seals.
      v:002: 'REV:5:2 | 2 | 2 | And I saw a strong angel, proclaiming with a loud
        voice: Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof?'
      v:003: REV:5:3 | 3 | 3 | And no man was able, neither in heaven nor on earth
        nor under the earth, to open the book, nor to look on it.
      v:004: REV:5:4 | 4 | 4 | And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to
        open the book, nor to see it.
      v:005: 'REV:5:5 | 5 | 5 | And one of the ancients said to me: Weep not: behold
        the lion of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the
        book and to loose the seven seals thereof.'
      v:006: 'REV:5:6 | 6 | 6 | And I saw: and behold in the midst of the throne and
        of the four living creatures and in the midst of the ancients, a Lamb standing,
        as it were slain, having seven horns and seven eyes: which are the seven Spirits
        of God, sent forth into all the earth.'
      v:007: REV:5:7 | 7 | 7 | And he came and took the book out of the right hand
        of him that sat on the throne.
      v:008: REV:5:8 | 8 | 8 | And when he had opened the book, the four living creatures
        and the four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb, having every one
        of them harps and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.
      v:009: 'REV:5:9 | 9 | 9 | And they sung a new canticle, saying: Thou art worthy,
        O Lord, to take the book and to open the seals thereof: because thou wast
        slain and hast redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every tribe and tongue
        and people and nation:'
      v:010: REV:5:10 | 10 | 10 | And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests,
        and we shall reign on the earth.
      v:011: REV:5:11 | 11 | 11 | And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels
        round about the throne and the living creatures and the ancients (and the
        number of them was thousands of thousands),
      v:012: 'REV:5:12 | 12 | 12 | Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain
        is worthy to receive power and divinity and wisdom and strength and honour
        and glory and benediction.'
      v:013: 'REV:5:13 | 13 | 13 | And every creature which is in heaven and on the
        earth and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in
        them, I heard all saying: To him that sitteth on the throne and to the Lamb,
        benediction and honour and glory and power, for ever and ever.'
      v:014: 'REV:5:14 | 14 | 14 | And the four living creatures said: Amen. And the
        four and twenty ancients fell down on their faces and adored him that liveth
        for ever and ever.'
  c:006:
    intro: What followed upon opening six of the seals.
    verses:
      v:001: 'REV:6:1 | 1 | 1 | And I saw that the Lamb had opened one of the seven
        seals: and I heard one of the four living creatures, as it were the voice
        of thunder, saying: Come and see.'
      v:002: 'REV:6:2 | 2 | 2 | And I saw: and behold a white horse, and he that sat
        on him had a bow, and there was a crown given him, and he went forth conquering
        that he might conquer.'
      v:003: 'REV:6:3 | 3 | 3 | And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the
        second living creature saying: Come and see.'
      v:004: 'REV:6:4 | 4 | 4 | And there went out another horse that was red. And
        to him that sat thereon, it was given that he should take peace from the earth:
        and that they should kill one another. And a great sword was given to him.'
      v:005: 'REV:6:5 | 5 | 5 | And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the
        third living creature saying: Come and see. And behold a black horse. And
        he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.'
      v:006: 'REV:6:6 | 6 | 6 | And I heard, as it were a voice in the midst of the

        the fig tree casteth its green figs when it is shaken by a great wind.

        add unto him the plagues written in this book.'
      v:019: REV:22:19 | 19 | 19 | And if any man shall take away from the words of

        this book.

intro: In the first, second, and third chapters of this Book are contained instructions
  and admonitions which St. John was commanded to write to the seven bishops of the
  churches in Asia. And in the following chapters, to the end, are contained prophecies
  of things that are to come to pass in the Church of Christ, particularly towards
  the end of the world, in the time of Antichrist. It was written in Greek, in the
  island of Patmos, where St. John was in banishment by order of the cruel emperor
  Domitian, about sixty-four years after our Lordâ€™s Ascension.
