      v:004: 'DAG:2:4 | 4 | 4 | And the Chaldeans answered the king in Syriac: O king, live for ever: tell to thy servants thy dream, and we will declare the interpretation thereof.'
      v:005: 'DAG:2:5 | 5 | 5 | And the king, answering, said to the Chaldeans: The thing is gone out of my mind: unless you tell me the dream, and the meaning thereof, you shall be put to death, and your houses shall be confiscated.'
      v:006: 'DAG:2:6 | 6 | 6 | but if you tell the dream, and the meaning of it, you shall receive of me rewards, and gifts, and great honour: therefore, tell me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.'
      v:007: 'DAG:2:7 | 7 | 7 | They answered again and said: Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will declare the interpretation of it.'
      v:008: 'DAG:2:8 | 8 | 8 | The king answered and said: I know for certain, that you seek to gain time, since you know that the thing is gone from me.'

Tell me, therefore, the dream, that I may know that you also give a true interpretation thereof.'
      v:010: 'DAG:2:10 | 10 | 10 | Then the Chaldeans answered before the king, and said: There is no man upon earth, that can accomplish thy word, O king; neither doth any king, though great and mighty, ask such a thing of any diviner, or wise man, or Chaldean.'
      v:011: 'DAG:2:11 | 11 | 11 | For the thing that thou askest, O king, is difficult: nor can any one be found that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose conversation is not with men.'

      v:015: 'DAG:2:15 | 15 | 15 | And he asked him that had received the orders of the king, why so cruel a sentence was gone forth from the face of the king. And when Arioch had told the matter to Daniel,'

      v:023: "DAG:2:23 | 23 | 23 | To thee, O God of our fathers, I give thanks, and I praise thee: because thou hast given me wisdom and strength: and now thou hast shewn me what we desired of thee, for thou hast made known to us the king's discourse."
      v:024: 'DAG:2:24 | 24 | 24 | After this Daniel went in to Arioch, to whom the king had given orders to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and he spoke thus to him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will tell the solution to the king.{VS:P}'
      v:025: 'DAG:2:25 | 25 | 25 | Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel to the king, and said to him: I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Juda, that will resolve the question to the king.'
      v:026: 'DAG:2:26 | 26 | 26 | The king answered, and said to Daniel, whose name was Baltassar: Thinkest thou indeed that thou canst tell me the dream that I saw, and the interpretation thereof?'
      v:027: 'DAG:2:27 | 27 | 27 | And Daniel made answer before the king, and said: The secret that the king desireth to know, none of the wise men, or the philosophers, or the diviners, or the soothsayers, can declare to the king.'
      v:028: 'DAG:2:28 | 28 | 28 | But there is a God in heaven that revealeth mysteries, who hath shewn to thee, O king Nabuchodonosor, what is to come to pass in the latter times. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:'
      v:029: 'DAG:2:29 | 29 | 29 | Thou, O king, didst begin to think in thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth mysteries shewed thee what shall come to pass.'
      v:030: 'DAG:2:30 | 30 | 30 | To me also this secret is revealed, not by any wisdom that I have more than all men alive: but that the interpretation might be made manifest to the king, and thou mightest know the thoughts of thy mind.'
      v:031: 'DAG:2:31 | 31 | 31 | Thou, O king, sawest, and behold there was as it were a great statue: this statue, which was great and high, tall of stature, stood before thee, and the look thereof was terrible.'
      v:032: 'DAG:2:32 | 32 | 32 | The head of this statue was of fine gold, but the breast and the arms of silver, and the belly and the thighs of brass.'
      v:033: 'DAG:2:33 | 33 | 33 | And the legs of iron, the feet part of iron and part of clay.'
      v:034: 'DAG:2:34 | 34 | 34 | Thus thou sawest, till a stone was cut out of a mountain without hands: and it struck the statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.'
      v:035: "DAG:2:35 | 35 | 35 | Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of a summer's threshing floor, and they were carried away by the wind: and there was no place found for them: but the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."
      v:036: 'DAG:2:36 | 36 | 36 | This is the dream: we will also tell the interpretation thereof before thee, O king.{VS:P}'
      v:037: 'DAG:2:37 | 37 | 37 | Thou art a king of kings: and the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, and strength, and power, and glory:'
      v:038: 'DAG:2:38 | 38 | 38 | And all places wherein the children of men, and the beasts of the field do dwell: he hath also given the birds of the air into thy hand, and hath put all things under thy power: thou, therefore, art the head of gold.'
      v:039: 'DAG:2:39 | 39 | 39 | And after thee shall rise up {FOOTNOTE:BEGIN 0}another kingdom{FOOTNOTE:END}, inferior to thee, of silver: and another {FOOTNOTE:BEGIN 1}third kingdom{FOOTNOTE:END} of brass, which shall rule over all the world.'
      v:040: 'DAG:2:40 | 40 | 40 | And {FOOTNOTE:BEGIN 0}the fourth kingdom{FOOTNOTE:END} shall be as iron. As iron breaketh into pieces, and subdueth all things, so shall that break, and destroy all these.'
      v:041: "DAG:2:41 | 41 | 41 | And whereas thou sawest the feet, and the toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron: the kingdom shall be divided, but yet it shall take its origin from the iron, according as thou sawest the iron mixed with the miry clay."
      v:042: 'DAG:2:42 | 42 | 42 | And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay: the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.'
      v:043: 'DAG:2:43 | 43 | 43 | And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall be mingled indeed together with the seed of man, but they shall not stick fast one to another, as iron cannot be mixed with clay.'
      v:044: 'DAG:2:44 | 44 | 44 | But in the days of those kingdoms, the God of heaven will set up {FOOTNOTE:BEGIN 0}a kingdom{FOOTNOTE:END} that shall never be destroyed, and his kingdom shall not be delivered up to another people: and it shall break in pieces, and shall consume all these kingdoms: and itself shall stand for ever.'
      v:045: 'DAG:2:45 | 45 | 45 | According as thou sawest, that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and broke in pieces the clay and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the gold, the great God hath shewn the king what shall come to pass hereafter, and the dream is true, and the interpretation thereof is faithful.{VS:P}'
      v:046: 'DAG:2:46 | 46 | 46 | Then king Nabuchodonosor fell on his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer in sacrifice to him victims and incense.'
      v:047: 'DAG:2:47 | 47 | 47 | And the king spoke to Daniel, and said: Verily, your God is the God of gods, and Lord of kings, and a revealer of hidden things: seeing thou couldst discover this secret.'
      v:048: 'DAG:2:48 | 48 | 48 | Then the king advanced Daniel to a high station, and gave him many and great gifts: and he made him governor over all the provinces of Babylon: and chief of the magistrates over all the wise men of Babylon.'
      v:049: "DAG:2:49 | 49 | 49 | And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, over the works of the province of Babylon: but Daniel himself was in the king's palace."

          note: 'Here St. Jerome takes notice, that from this verse, to ver. 91, was not in the Hebrew in his time. But as it was in all the Greek Bibles, (which were originally translated from the Hebrew,) it is more than probable that it had been formerly in the Hebrew or rather in the Chaldaic, in which the book of Daniel was written. But this is certain: that it is, and has been of old, received by the church, and read as canonical scripture in her liturgy, and divine offices.'

      v:005: 'DAG:14:5 | 5 | 5 | And the king said to him: Doth not Bel seem to thee to be a living god? Seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day?'
      v:006: 'DAG:14:6 | 6 | 6 | Then Daniel smiled, and said: O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, neither hath he eaten at any time.'
      v:007: 'DAG:14:7 | 7 | 7 | And the king being angry, called for his priests, and said to them: If you tell me not who it is that eateth up these expenses, you shall die.'
      v:008: 'DAG:14:8 | 8 | 8 | But if you can shew that Bel eateth these things, Daniel shall die, because he hath blasphemed against Bel. And Daniel said to the king: Be it done according to thy word.'
      v:009: 'DAG:14:9 | 9 | 9 | Now the priests of Bel were seventy, besides their wives, and little ones, and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel.'
      v:010: 'DAG:14:10 | 10 | 10 | And the priests of Bel said: Behold, we go out: and do thou, O king, set on the meats, and make ready the wine, and shut the door fast, and seal it with thy own ring:'
      v:011: 'DAG:14:11 | 11 | 11 | And when thou comest in the morning, if thou findest not that Bel hath eaten up all, we will suffer death, or else Daniel, that hath lied against us.'
      v:012: 'DAG:14:12 | 12 | 12 | And they little regarded it, because they had made under the table a secret entrance, and they always came in by it, and consumed those things.'
      v:013: "DAG:14:13 | 13 | 13 | So it came to pass after they were gone out, the king set the meats before Bel: and Daniel commanded his servants, and they brought ashes, and he sifted them all over the temple before the king: and going forth, they shut the door, and having sealed it with the king's ring, they departed."
      v:014: 'DAG:14:14 | 14 | 14 | But the priests went in by night, according to their custom, with their wives, and their children: and they ate and drank up all.'
      v:015: 'DAG:14:15 | 15 | 15 | And the king arose early in the morning, and Daniel with him.'
      v:016: 'DAG:14:16 | 16 | 16 | And the king said: Are the seals whole, Daniel? And he answered: They are whole, O king.'
      v:017: 'DAG:14:17 | 17 | 17 | And as soon as he had opened the door, the king looked upon the table, and cried out with a loud voice: Great art thou, O Bel, and there is not any deceit with thee.'
      v:018: 'DAG:14:18 | 18 | 18 | And Daniel laughed: and he held the king, that he should not go in: and he said: Behold the pavement, mark whose footsteps these are.'
      v:019: 'DAG:14:19 | 19 | 19 | And the king said: I see the footsteps of men, and women, and children. And the king was angry.'
      v:020: 'DAG:14:20 | 20 | 20 | Then he took the priests, and their wives, and their children: and they shewed him the private doors by which they came in, and consumed the things that were on the table.'
      v:021: 'DAG:14:21 | 21 | 21 | The king, therefore, put them to death, and delivered Bel into the power of Daniel: who destroyed him and his temple.{VS:P}'
      v:022: 'DAG:14:22 | 22 | 22 | And there was a great dragon in that place, and the Babylonians worshipped him.'
      v:023: 'DAG:14:23 | 23 | 23 | And the king said to Daniel: Behold, thou canst not say now, that this is not a living god: adore him, therefore.'
      v:024: 'DAG:14:24 | 24 | 24 | And Daniel said: I adore the Lord, my God: for he is the living God: but that is no living god.'
      v:025: 'DAG:14:25 | 25 | 25 | But give me leave, O king, and I will kill this dragon without sword or club. And the king said, I give thee leave.'
      v:026: "DAG:14:26 | 26 | 26 | Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and boiled them together: and he made lumps, and put them into the dragon's mouth, and the dragon burst asunder. And he said: Behold him whom you worship."
      v:027: 'DAG:14:27 | 27 | 27 | And when the Babylonians had heard this, they took great indignation: and being gathered together against the king, they said: The king is become a Jew. He hath destroyed Bel, he hath killed the dragon, and he hath put the priests to death.'
      v:028: 'DAG:14:28 | 28 | 28 | And they came to the king, and said: Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy thee and thy house.'
      v:029: 'DAG:14:29 | 29 | 29 | And the king saw that they pressed upon him violently: and being constrained by necessity: he delivered Daniel to them.'
      v:030: 'DAG:14:30 | 30 | 30 | And they cast him into {FOOTNOTE:BEGIN 0}the den of lions{FOOTNOTE:END}, and he was there six days.'
      v:031: 'DAG:14:31 | 31 | 31 | And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given to them two carcasses every day, and two sheep: but then they were not given unto them, that they might devour Daniel.'
      v:032: 'DAG:14:32 | 32 | 32 | Now there was in Judea a prophet called {FOOTNOTE:BEGIN 0}Habacuc{FOOTNOTE:END}, and he had boiled pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl: and was going into the field, to carry it to the reapers.'
      v:033: "DAG:14:33 | 33 | 33 | And the angel of the Lord said to Habacuc: Carry the dinner which thou hast into Babylon, to Daniel, who is in the lions' den."
      v:034: 'DAG:14:34 | 34 | 34 | And Habacuc said: Lord, I never saw Babylon, nor do I know the den.'
      v:035: 'DAG:14:35 | 35 | 35 | And the angel of the Lord took him by the top of his head, and carried him by the hair of his head, and set him in Babylon, over the den, in the force of his spirit.'
      v:036: 'DAG:14:36 | 36 | 36 | And Habacuc cried, saying: O Daniel, thou servant of God, take the dinner that God hath sent thee.'
      v:037: 'DAG:14:37 | 37 | 37 | And Daniel said, Thou hast remembered me, O God, and thou hast not forsaken them that love thee.'
      v:038: 'DAG:14:38 | 38 | 38 | And Daniel arose, and ate. And the angel of the Lord presently set Habacuc again in his own place.{VS:P}'
      v:039: 'DAG:14:39 | 39 | 39 | And upon the seventh day the king came to bewail Daniel: and he came to the den, and looked in, and behold Daniel was sitting in the midst of the lions.'
      v:040: "DAG:14:40 | 40 | 40 | And the king cried out with a loud voice, saying: Great art thou, O Lord, the God of Daniel. And he drew him out of the lions' den."
      v:041: 'DAG:14:41 | 41 | 41 | But those that had been the cause of his destruction, he cast into the den, and they were devoured in a moment before him.'
      v:042: "DAG:14:42 | 42 | 42 | Then the king said: Let all the inhabitants of the whole earth fear the God of Daniel: for he is the Saviour, working signs, and wonders in the earth: who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions' den."
intro: 'DANIEL, whose name signifies THE JUDGMENT OF GOD, was of the royal blood of the kings of Juda: and one of those that were first of all carried away into captivity. He was so renowned for wisdom and knowledge, that it became a proverb among the Babylonians, AS WISE AS DANIEL (Ezech. 28.3). And his holiness was so great from his very childhood, that at the time when he was as yet but a young man, he is joined by the SPIRIT of GOD with NOE and JOB, as three persons most eminent for virtue and sanctity, Ezech. 14. He is not commonly numbered by the Hebrews among THE PROPHETS: because he lived at court, and in high station in the world: but if we consider his many clear predictions of things to come, we shall find that no one better deserves the name and title of A PROPHET: which also has been given him by the SON of GOD himself, Matt. 24, Mark 13., Luke 21.'
