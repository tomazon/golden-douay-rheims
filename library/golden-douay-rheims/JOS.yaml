  c:001:
    intro: Josue, encouraged by the Lord, admonisheth the people to prepare themselves
      to pass over the Jordan.
    verses:
      v:001: 'JOS:1:1 | 1 | 1 | Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the
        servant of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Josue, the son of Nun, the minister
        of Moses, and said to him:'
      v:002: 'JOS:1:2 | 2 | 2 | Moses my servant is dead: arise, and pass over this
        Jordan, thou and thy people with thee, into the land which I will give to
        the children of Israel.'
      v:003: JOS:1:3 | 3 | 3 | I will deliver to you every place that the sole of
        your foot shall tread upon, as I have said to Moses.
      v:004: JOS:1:4 | 4 | 4 | From the desert, and from Libanus unto the great river
        Euphrates, all the land of the Hethites, unto the great sea toward the going
        down of the sun, shall be your border.
      v:005: 'JOS:1:5 | 5 | 5 | No man shall be able to resist you all the days of
        thy life: as I have been with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leave
        thee, nor forsake thee.'
      v:006: 'JOS:1:6 | 6 | 6 | Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt divide
        by lot to this people the land for which I swore to their fathers, that I
        would deliver it to them.'
      v:007: 'JOS:1:7 | 7 | 7 | Take courage therefore, and be very valiant: that
        thou mayst observe and do all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded
        thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayst understand
        all things which thou dost.'
      v:008: 'JOS:1:8 | 8 | 8 | Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth:
        but thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayst observe and do
        all things that are written in it: then shalt thou direct thy way, and understand
        it.'
      v:009: 'JOS:1:9 | 9 | 9 | Behold I command thee, take courage, and be strong.
        Fear not, and be not dismayed: because the Lord thy God is with thee in all
        things whatsoever thou shalt go to.'
      v:010: 'JOS:1:10 | 10 | 10 | And Josue commanded the princes of the people,
        saying: Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, and say:'
      v:011: 'JOS:1:11 | 11 | 11 | Prepare your victuals: for after the third day
        you shall pass over the Jordan, and shall go in to possess the land, which
        the Lord your God will give you.'
      v:012: 'JOS:1:12 | 12 | 12 | And he said to the Rubenites, and the Gadites,
        and the half tribe of Manasses:'
      v:013: 'JOS:1:13 | 13 | 13 | Remember the word, which Moses the servant of the
        Lord commanded you, saying: The Lord your God hath given you rest, and all
        this land.'
      v:014: 'JOS:1:14 | 14 | 14 | Your wives, and children; and cattle, shall remain
        in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan: but pass you
        over armed before your brethren all of you that are strong of hand, and fight
        for them,'
      v:015: 'JOS:1:15 | 15 | 15 | Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he
        hath given you, and they also possess the land which the Lord your God will
        give them: and so you shall return into the land of your possession, and you
        shall dwell in it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the
        Jordan, toward the rising of the sun.'
      v:016: 'JOS:1:16 | 16 | 16 | And they made answer to Josue, and said: All that
        thou hast commanded us, we will do: and whither soever thou shalt send us,
        we will go.'
      v:017: 'JOS:1:17 | 17 | 17 | As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey
        thee also: only be the Lord thy God with thee, as he was with Moses.'
      v:018: 'JOS:1:18 | 18 | 18 | He that shall gainsay thy mouth, and not obey all
        thy words, that thou shalt command him, let him die: only take thou courage,
        and do manfully.'
  c:002:
    intro: Two spies are sent to Jericho, who are received and concealed by Rahab.
    verses:
      v:001: 'JOS:2:1 | 1 | 1 | And Josue, the son of Nun, sent from Setim two men,
        to spy secretly: and said to them: Go, and view the land, and the city of
        Jericho. They went, and entered into the house of a woman that was a harlot,
        named Rahab, and lodged with her.'
      v:002: 'JOS:2:2 | 2 | 2 | And it was told the king of Jericho, and was said:
        Behold there are men come in hither, by night, of the children of Israel,
        to spy the land.'
      v:003: 'JOS:2:3 | 3 | 3 | And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying: Bring
        forth the men that came to thee, and are entered into thy house: for they
        are spies, and are come to view all the land.'
      v:004: 'JOS:2:4 | 4 | 4 | And the woman taking the men, hid them, and said:
        I confess they came to me, but I knew not whence they were:'
      v:005: 'JOS:2:5 | 5 | 5 | And at the time of shutting the gate in the dark,
        they also went out together. I know not whither they are gone: pursue after
        them quickly, and you will overtake them.'
      v:006: JOS:2:6 | 6 | 6 | But she made the men go up to the top of her house,
        and covered them with the stalks of flax, which was there.
      v:007: 'JOS:2:7 | 7 | 7 | Now they that were sent, pursued after them, by the
        way that leadeth to the fords of the Jordan: and as soon as they were gone
        out, the gate was presently shut.'
      v:008: 'JOS:2:8 | 8 | 8 | The men that were hid were not yet asleep, when behold
        the woman went up to them, and said:'
      v:009: 'JOS:2:9 | 9 | 9 | I know that the Lord hath given this land to you:
        for the dread of you is fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land
        have lost all strength.'
      v:010: 'JOS:2:10 | 10 | 10 | We have heard that the Lord dried up the water
        of the Red Sea, at your going in, when you came out of Egypt: and what things
        you did to the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan, Sehon
        and Og whom you slew.'
      v:011: 'JOS:2:11 | 11 | 11 | And at the hearing these things, we were affrighted,
        and our heart fainted away, neither did there remain any spirit in us, at
        your coming in: for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above, and in the
        earth beneath.'
      v:012: 'JOS:2:12 | 12 | 12 | Now, therefore, swear ye to me by the Lord, that
        as I have shewed mercy to you, so you also will shew mercy to my father''s
        house: and give me a true token.'
      v:013: JOS:2:13 | 13 | 13 | That you will save my father and mother, my brethren
        and sisters, and all things that are theirs, and deliver our souls from death.
      v:014: 'JOS:2:14 | 14 | 14 | They answered her: Be our lives for you unto death,
        only if thou betray us not. And when the Lord shall have delivered us the
        land, we will shew thee mercy and truth.'
      v:015: 'JOS:2:15 | 15 | 15 | Then she let them down with a cord out of a window:
        for her house joined close to the wall.'
      v:016: 'JOS:2:16 | 16 | 16 | And she said to them: Get ye up to the mountains,
        lest perhaps they meet you as they return: and there lie ye hid three days,
        till they come back, and so you shall go on your way.'
      v:017: 'JOS:2:17 | 17 | 17 | And they said to her: We shall be blameless of
        this oath, which thou hast made us swear,'
      v:018: 'JOS:2:18 | 18 | 18 | If, when we come into the land, this scarlet cord
        be a sign, and thou tie it in the window, by which thou hast let us down:
        and gather together thy father and mother, and brethren, and all thy kindred
        into thy house.'
      v:019: JOS:2:19 | 19 | 19 | Whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house,
        his blood shall be upon his own head, and we shall be quit. But the blood
        of all that shall be with thee in the house, shall light upon our head, if
        any man touch them.
      v:020: JOS:2:20 | 20 | 20 | But if thou wilt betray us, and utter this word
        abroad, we shall be quit of this oath, which thou hast made us swear.
      v:021: 'JOS:2:21 | 21 | 21 | And she answered: As you have spoken, so be it
        done: and sending them on their way, she hung the scarlet cord in the window.'
      v:022: JOS:2:22 | 22 | 22 | But they went and came to the mountains, and stayed
        there three days, till they that pursued them were returned. for having sought
        them through all the way, they found them not.
      v:023: 'JOS:2:23 | 23 | 23 | And when they were gone back into the city, the
        spies returned, and came down from the mountain: and passing over the Jordan,
        they came to Josue, the son of Nun, and told him all that befel them,'
      v:024: 'JOS:2:24 | 24 | 24 | And said: the Lord hath delivered all this land
        into our hands, and all the inhabitants thereof are overthrown with fear.'
  c:003:
    intro: The river Jordan is miraculously dried up for the passage of the children
      of Israel.
    verses:
      v:001: 'JOS:3:1 | 1 | 1 | And Josue rose before daylight, and removed the camp:
        and they departed from Setim, and came to the Jordan: he, and all the children
        of Israel, and they abode there for three days.'
      v:002: JOS:3:2 | 2 | 2 | After which, the heralds went through the midst of
        the camp,
      v:003: 'JOS:3:3 | 3 | 3 | And began to proclaim: When you shall see the ark
        of the covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests of the race of Levi
        carrying it, rise you up also, and follow them as they go before:'
      v:004: 'JOS:3:4 | 4 | 4 | And let there be between you and the ark the space
        of two thousand cubits: that you may see it afar off, and know which way you
        must go: for you have not gone this way before: and take care you come not
        near the ark.'
      v:005: 'JOS:3:5 | 5 | 5 | And Josue said to the people: Be ye sanctified: for
        tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.'
      v:006: 'JOS:3:6 | 6 | 6 | And he said to the priests: Take up the ark of the
        covenant, and go before the people. And they obeyed his commands, and took
        it up, and walked before them.'
      v:007: 'JOS:3:7 | 7 | 7 | And the Lord said to Josue: This day will I begin
        to exalt thee before Israel: that they may know that as I was with Moses,
        so I am with thee also.'
      v:008: 'JOS:3:8 | 8 | 8 | And do thou command the priests, that carry the ark
        of the covenant, and say to them: When you shall have entered into part of
        the water of the Jordan, stand in it.'
      v:009: 'JOS:3:9 | 9 | 9 | And Josue said to the children of Israel: Come hither,
        and hear the word of the Lord your God.'
      v:010: 'JOS:3:10 | 10 | 10 | And again he said: By this you shall know, that
        the Lord, the living God, is in the midst of you, and that he shall destroy,
        before your sight, the Chanaanite and the Hethite, the Hevite and the Pherezite,
        the Gergesite also, and the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite.'
      v:011: JOS:3:11 | 11 | 11 | Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all
        the earth shall go before you into the Jordan.
      v:012: JOS:3:12 | 12 | 12 | Prepare ye twelve men of the tribes of Israel, one
        of every tribe.
      v:013: 'JOS:3:13 | 13 | 13 | And when the priests, that carry the ark of the
        Lord the God of the whole earth, shall set the soles of their feet in the
        waters of the Jordan, the waters that are beneath shall run down and go off:
        and those that come from above, shall stand together upon a heap.'
      v:014: 'JOS:3:14 | 14 | 14 | So the people went out of their tents, to pass
        over the Jordan: and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant, went
        on before them.'
      v:015: JOS:3:15 | 15 | 15 | And as soon as they came into the Jordan, and their
        feet were dipped in part of the water, (now the Jordan, it being harvest time,
        had filled the banks of its channel,)
      v:016: 'JOS:3:16 | 16 | 16 | The waters that came down from above stood in one
        place, and swelling up like a mountain, were seen afar off, from the city
        that is called Adom, to the place of Sarthan: but those that were beneath,
        ran down into the sea of the wilderness, (which now is called the Dead Sea)
        until they wholly failed.'
      v:017: 'JOS:3:17 | 17 | 17 | And the people marched over against Jericho: and
        the priests that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, stood girded
        upon the dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all the people passed
        over, through the channel that was dried up.'
  c:004:
    intro: Twelve stones are taken out of the river to be set up for a monument of
      the miracle; and other twelve are placed in the midst of the river.
    verses:
      v:001: 'JOS:4:1 | 1 | 1 | And when they were passed over, the Lord said to Josue:'
      v:002: 'JOS:4:2 | 2 | 2 | Choose twelve men, one of every tribe:'
      v:003: JOS:4:3 | 3 | 3 | And command them to take out of the midst of the Jordan,
        where the feet of the priests stood, twelve very hard stones, which you shall
        set in the place of the camp, where you shall pitch your tents this night.
      v:004: JOS:4:4 | 4 | 4 | And Josue called twelve men, whom he had chosen out
        of the children of Israel, one out of every tribe,
      v:005: 'JOS:4:5 | 5 | 5 | And he said to them: Go before the ark of the Lord
        your God to the midst of the Jordan, and carry from thence every man a stone
        on your shoulders, according to the number of the children of Israel,'
      v:006: 'JOS:4:6 | 6 | 6 | That it may be a sign among you: and when your children
        shall ask you tomorrow, saying: What means these stones?'
      v:007: 'JOS:4:7 | 7 | 7 | You shall answer them: The waters of the Jordan ran
        off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord when it passed over the same:
        therefore were these stones set for a monument of the children of Israel forever.'
      v:008: JOS:4:8 | 8 | 8 | The children of Israel therefore did as Josue commanded
        them, carrying out of the channel of the Jordan twelve stones, as the Lord
        had commanded him according to the number of the children of Israel unto the
        place wherein they camped, and there they set them.
      v:009: 'JOS:4:9 | 9 | 9 | And Josue put other twelve stones in the midst of
        the channel of the Jordan, where the priests stood that carried the ark of
        the covenant: and they are there until this present day.'
      v:010: JOS:4:10 | 10 | 10 | Now the priests that carried the ark, stood in the
        midst of the Jordan, till all things were accomplished, which the Lord had
        commanded Josue to speak to the people, and Moses had said to him. And the
        people made haste, and passed over.
      v:011: JOS:4:11 | 11 | 11 | And when they had all passed over, the ark also
        of the Lord passed over, and the priests went before the people.
      v:012: JOS:4:12 | 12 | 12 | The children of Ruben also, and Gad, and half the
        tribe of Manasses, went armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had
        commanded them.
      v:013: JOS:4:13 | 13 | 13 | And forty thousand fighting men by their troops
        and bands, marched through the plains and fields of the city of Jericho.
      v:014: JOS:4:14 | 14 | 14 | In that day the Lord magnified Josue in the sight
        of all Israel, that they should fear him, as they had feared Moses, while
        he lived.
      v:015: 'JOS:4:15 | 15 | 15 | And he said to him:'
      v:016: JOS:4:16 | 16 | 16 | Command the priests, that carry the ark of the covenant,
        to come up out of the Jordan.
      v:017: 'JOS:4:17 | 17 | 17 | And he commanded them, saying: Come ye up out of
        the Jordan.'
      v:018: JOS:4:18 | 18 | 18 | And when they that carried the ark of the covenant
        of the Lord, were come up, and began to tread on the dry ground, the waters
        returned into their channel, and ran as they were wont before.
      v:019: JOS:4:19 | 19 | 19 | And the people came up out of the Jordan, the tenth
        day of the first month, and camped in Galgal, over against the east side of
        the city of Jericho.
      v:020: JOS:4:20 | 20 | 20 | And the twelve stones, which they had taken out
        of the channel of the Jordan, Josue pitched in Galgal,
      v:021: 'JOS:4:21 | 21 | 21 | And said to the children of Israel: When your children
        shall ask their fathers tomorrow, and shall say to them: What mean these stones?'
      v:022: 'JOS:4:22 | 22 | 22 | You shall teach them, and say: Israel passed over
        this Jordan through the dry channel,'
      v:023: 'JOS:4:23 | 23 | 23 | The Lord your God drying up the waters thereof
        in your sight, until you passed over:'
      v:024: 'JOS:4:24 | 24 | 24 | As he had done before in the Red Sea, which he
        dried up till we passed through:'
      v:025: JOS:4:25 | 25 | 25 | That all the people of the earth may learn the most
        mighty hand of the Lord, that you also may fear the Lord your God for ever.
  c:005:
    intro: 'The people are circumcised: they keep the pasch. The manna ceaseth. An
      angel appeareth to Josue.'
    verses:
      v:001: JOS:5:1 | 1 | 1 | Now when all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwelt
        beyond the Jordan, westward, and all the kings of Chanaan, who possessed the
        places near the great sea, had heard that the Lord had dried up the waters
        of the Jordan before the children of Israel, till they passed over, their
        heart failed them, and there remained no spirit in them, fearing the coming
        in of the children of Israel.
      v:002: 'JOS:5:2 | 2 | 2 | At that time the Lord said to Josue: Make thee knives
        of stone, and circumcise the second time the children of Israel.'
      v:003: JOS:5:3 | 3 | 3 | He did what the Lord had commanded, and he circumcised
        the children of Israel in the hill of the foreskins.
      v:004: 'JOS:5:4 | 4 | 4 | Now this is the cause of the second circumcision:
        All the people that came out of Egypt that were males, all the men fit for
        war, died in the desert, during the time of the long going about in the way:'
      v:005: JOS:5:5 | 5 | 5 | Now these were all circumcised. But the people that
        were born in the desert,
      v:006: 'JOS:5:6 | 6 | 6 | During the forty years of the journey in the wide
        wilderness, were uncircumcised: till all they were consumed that had not heard
        the voice of the Lord, and to whom he had sworn before, that he would not
        shew them the land flowing with milk and honey.'
      v:007: 'JOS:5:7 | 7 | 7 | The children of these succeeded in the place of their
        fathers, and were circumcised by Josue: for they were uncircumcised even as
        they were born, and no one had circumcised them in the way.'
      v:008: JOS:5:8 | 8 | 8 | Now after they were all circumcised, they remained
        in the same place of the camp, until they were healed.
      v:009: 'JOS:5:9 | 9 | 9 | And the Lord said to Josue: This day have I taken
        away from you the reproach of Egypt. And the name of that place was called
        Galgal, until this present day.'
      v:010: 'JOS:5:10 | 10 | 10 | And the children of Israel abode in Galgal, and
        they kept the phase, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in the
        plains of Jericho:'
      v:011: JOS:5:11 | 11 | 11 | And they ate on the next day unleavened bread of
        the corn of the land, and frumenty of the same year.
      v:012: JOS:5:12 | 12 | 12 | And the manna ceased after they ate of the corn
        of the land, neither did the children of Israel use that food any more, but
        they ate of the corn of the present year of the land of Chanaan.
      v:013: 'JOS:5:13 | 13 | 13 | And when Josue was in the field of the city of
        Jericho, he lifted up his eyes, and saw a man standing over against him, holding
        a drawn sword, and he went to him, and said: Art thou one of ours, or of our
        adversaries?'
      v:014: 'JOS:5:14 | 14 | 14 | And he answered: No: but I am prince of the host
        of the Lord, and now I am come.'
      v:015: 'JOS:5:15 | 15 | 15 | Josue fell on his face to the ground. And worshipping,
        said: What saith my lord to his servant?'
      v:016: 'JOS:5:16 | 16 | 16 | Loose, saith he, thy shoes from off thy feet: for
        the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Josue did as was commanded him.'

    intro: 'After seven days’ processions, the priests sounding the trumpets, the
      walls of Jericho fall down: and the city is taken and destroyed.'
    verses:
      v:001: JOS:6:1 | 1 | 1 | Now Jericho was close shut up and fenced, for fear
        of the children of Israel, and no man durst go out or come in.
      v:002: 'JOS:6:2 | 2 | 2 | And the Lord said to Josue: Behold I have given into
        thy hands Jericho, and the king thereof, and all the valiant men.'
      v:003: 'JOS:6:3 | 3 | 3 | Go round about the city all ye fighting men once a
        day: so shall ye do for six days.'
      v:004: 'JOS:6:4 | 4 | 4 | And on the seventh day the priests shall take the
        seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee, and shall go before the ark
        of the covenant: and you shall go about the city seven times, and the priests
        shall sound the trumpets.'
      v:005: JOS:6:5 | 5 | 5 | And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer
        and broken tune, and shall sound in your ears, all the people shall shout
        together with a very great shout, and the walls of the city shall fall to
        the ground, and they shall enter in every one at the place against which they
        shall stand.
      v:006: 'JOS:6:6 | 6 | 6 | Then Josue, the son of Nun, called the priests, and
        said to them: Take the ark of the covenant: and let seven other priests take
        the seven trumpets of the jubilee, and march before the ark of the Lord.'
      v:007: 'JOS:6:7 | 7 | 7 | And he said to the people: Go, and compass the city,
        armed, marching before the ark of the Lord.'
      v:008: JOS:6:8 | 8 | 8 | And when Josue had ended his words, and the seven priests
        blew the seven trumpets before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
      v:009: JOS:6:9 | 9 | 9 | And all the armed men went before, the rest of the
        common people followed the ark, and the sound of the trumpets was heard on
        all sides.
      v:010: 'JOS:6:10 | 10 | 10 | But Josue had commanded the people, saying: You
        shall not shout, nor shall your voice be heard, nor any word go out of your
        mouth: until the day come wherein I shall say to you: Cry, and shout.'
      v:011: JOS:6:11 | 11 | 11 | So the ark of the Lord went about the city once
        a day, and returning into the camp, abode there.
      v:012: JOS:6:12 | 12 | 12 | And Josue rising before day, the priests took the
        ark of the Lord,
      v:013: 'JOS:6:13 | 13 | 13 | And seven of them seven trumpets, which are used
        in the jubilee: and they went before the ark of the Lord, walking and sounding
        the trumpets: and the armed men went before them, and the rest of the common
        people followed the ark, and they blew the trumpets.'
      v:014: JOS:6:14 | 14 | 14 | And they went round about the city the second day
        once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.
      v:015: JOS:6:15 | 15 | 15 | But the seventh day, rising up early, they went
        about the city, as it was ordered, seven times.
      v:016: 'JOS:6:16 | 16 | 16 | And when in the seventh going about the priests
        sounded with the trumpets, Josue said to all Israel: Shout: for the Lord hath
        delivered the city to you:'
      v:017: 'JOS:6:17 | 17 | 17 | And let this city be an anathema, and all things
        that are in it, to the Lord. Let only Rahab, the harlot, live, with all that
        are with her in the house: for she hid the messengers whom we sent.'
      v:018: JOS:6:18 | 18 | 18 | But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things
        that are forbidden, and you be guilty of transgression, and all the camp of
        Israel be under sin, and be troubled.
      v:019: JOS:6:19 | 19 | 19 | But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be, or
        vessels of brass and iron, let it be consecrated to the Lord, laid up in his
        treasures.
      v:020: 'JOS:6:20 | 20 | 20 | So all the people making a shout, and the trumpets
        sounding, when the voice and the sound thundered in the ears of the multitude,
        the walls forthwith fell down: and every man went up by the place that was
        over against him: and they took the city,'
      v:021: JOS:6:21 | 21 | 21 | And killed all that were in it, man and woman, young
        and old. The oxen also, and the sheep, and the asses, they slew with the edge
        of the sword.
      v:022: 'JOS:6:22 | 22 | 22 | But Josue said to the two men that had been sent
        for spies: Go into the harlot''s house, and bring her out, and all things
        that are hers, as you assured her by oath.'
      v:023: JOS:6:23 | 23 | 23 | And the young men went in, and brought out Rahab,
        and her parents, her brethren also, and all her goods, and her kindred, and
        made them to stay without the camp.
      v:024: JOS:6:24 | 24 | 24 | But they burned the city, and all things that were
        therein; except the gold and silver, and vessels of brass and iron, which
        they consecrated unto the treasury of the Lord.
      v:025: 'JOS:6:25 | 25 | 25 | But Josue saved Rahab the harlot, and her father''s
        house, and all she had, and they dwelt in the midst of Israel until this present
        day: because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy out Jericho. At
        that time, Josue made an imprecation, saying:'
      v:026: JOS:6:26 | 26 | 26 | Cursed be the man before the Lord, that shall raise
        up and build the city of Jericho. In his firstborn may he lay the foundation
        thereof, and in the last of his children set up its gates.
      v:027: JOS:6:27 | 27 | 27 | And the Lord was with Josue, and his name was noised
        throughout all the land.
  c:007:
    intro: For the sins of Achan, the Israelites are defeated at Hai. The offender
      is found out; and stoned to death, and God’s wrath is turned from them.
    verses:
      v:001: 'JOS:7:1 | 1 | 1 | But the children of Israel transgressed the commandment,
        and took to their own use of that which was accursed. for Achan, the son of
        Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda, took something
        of the anathema: and the Lord was angry against the children of Israel.'
      v:002: 'JOS:7:2 | 2 | 2 | And when Josue sent men from Jericho against Hai,
        which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of the town of Bethel, he said
        to them: Go up, and view the country: and they fulfilled his command, and
        viewed Hai.'
      v:003: 'JOS:7:3 | 3 | 3 | And returning, they said to him: Let not all the people
        go up, but let two or three thousand men go, and destroy the city: why should
        all the people be troubled in vain, against enemies that are very few?'
      v:004: 'JOS:7:4 | 4 | 4 | There went up therefore three thousand fighting men:
        who immediately turned their backs,'
      v:005: 'JOS:7:5 | 5 | 5 | And were defeated by the men of the city of Hai, and
        there fell of them six and thirty men: and the enemies pursued them from the
        gate as far as Sabarim, and they slew them as they fled by the descent: and
        the heart of the people was struck with fear, and melted like water.'
      v:006: 'JOS:7:6 | 6 | 6 | But Josue rent his garments, and fell flat on the
        ground, before the ark of the Lord, until the evening, both he and all the
        ancients of Israel: and they put dust upon their heads.'
      v:007: 'JOS:7:7 | 7 | 7 | And Josue said: Alas, O Lord God, why wouldst thou
        bring this people over the river Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the
        Amorrhite, and to destroy us? would God we had stayed beyond the Jordan, as
        we began.'
      v:008: JOS:7:8 | 8 | 8 | My Lord God, what shall I say, seeing Israel turning
        their backs to their enemies?
      v:009: 'JOS:7:9 | 9 | 9 | The Chanaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land,
        will hear of it, and being gathered together will surround us, and cut off
        our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name?'
      v:010: 'JOS:7:10 | 10 | 10 | And the Lord said to Josue: Arise, why liest thou
        flat on the ground?'
      v:011: 'JOS:7:11 | 11 | 11 | Israel hath sinned, and transgressed my covenant:
        and they have taken of the anathema, and have stolen and lied, and have hid
        it among their goods.'
      v:012: 'JOS:7:12 | 12 | 12 | Neither can Israel stand before his enemies, but
        he shall flee from them: because he is defiled with the anathema. I will be
        no more with you, till you destroy him that is guilty of this wickedness.'
      v:013: 'JOS:7:13 | 13 | 13 | Arise, sanctify the people, and say to them: Be
        ye sanctified against tomorrow: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel: The
        curse is in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thy enemies,
        till he be destroyed out of thee, that is defiled with this wickedness.'
      v:014: 'JOS:7:14 | 14 | 14 | And you shall come in the morning, every one by
        your tribes: and what tribe soever the lot shall find, it shall come by its
        kindreds, and the kindred by its houses and the house by the men.'
      v:015: JOS:7:15 | 15 | 15 | And whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of
        this fact, he shall be burnt with fire, with all his substance, because he
        hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and hath done wickedness in Israel.
      v:016: JOS:7:16 | 16 | 16 | Josue, therefore, when he rose in the morning, made
        Israel to come by their tribes, and the tribe of Juda was found.
      v:017: 'JOS:7:17 | 17 | 17 | Which being brought by in families, it was found
        to be the family of Zare. Bringing that also by the houses, he found it to
        be Zabdi:'
      v:018: JOS:7:18 | 18 | 18 | And bringing his house man by man, he found Achan,
        the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda.
      v:019: 'JOS:7:19 | 19 | 19 | And Josue said to Achan: My son, give glory to
        the Lord God of Israel, and confess, and tell me what thou hast done, hide
        it not.'
      v:020: 'JOS:7:20 | 20 | 20 | And Achan answered Josue, and said to him: Indeed
        I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have
        I done.'
      v:021: 'JOS:7:21 | 21 | 21 | For I saw among the spoils a scarlet garment, exceeding
        good, and two hundred sicles of silver, and a golden rule of fifty sicles:
        and I coveted them, and I took them away, and hid them in the ground in the
        midst of my tent, and the silver I covered with the earth that I dug up.'
      v:022: 'JOS:7:22 | 22 | 22 | Josue therefore sent ministers: who running to
        his tent, found all hid in the same place, together with the silver.'
      v:023: JOS:7:23 | 23 | 23 | And taking them away out of the tent, they brought
        them to Josue, and to all the children of Israel, and threw them down before
        the Lord.
      v:024: 'JOS:7:24 | 24 | 24 | Then Josue, and all Israel with him, took Achan,
        the son of Zare, and the silver, and the garment, and the golden rule, his
        sons also, and his daughters, his oxen, and asses, and sheep, the tent also,
        and all the goods: and brought them to the valley of Achor:'
      v:025: 'JOS:7:25 | 25 | 25 | Where Josue said: Because thou hast troubled us,
        the Lord trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him: and all things
        that were his, were consumed with fire.'
      v:026: JOS:7:26 | 26 | 26 | And they gathered together upon him a great heap
        of stones, which remaineth until this present day And the wrath of the Lord
        was turned away from them. And the name of that place was called the Valley
        of Achor, until this day.

    verses:
      v:001: 'JOS:8:1 | 1 | 1 | And the Lord said to Josue: Fear not, nor be thou
        dismayed: take with thee all the multitude of fighting men, arise, and go
        up to the town of Hai: Behold I have delivered into thy hand the king thereof,
        and the people, and the city, and the land.'
      v:002: 'JOS:8:2 | 2 | 2 | And thou shalt do to the city of Hai, and to the king
        thereof, as thou hast done to Jericho, and to the king thereof: but the spoils,
        and all the cattle, you shall take for a prey to yourselves: lay an ambush
        for the city behind it.'
      v:003: 'JOS:8:3 | 3 | 3 | And Josue arose, and all the army of the fighting
        men with him, to go up against Hai: and he sent thirty thousand chosen valiant
        men in the night,'
      v:004: 'JOS:8:4 | 4 | 4 | And commanded them, saying: Lay an ambush behind the
        city: and go not very far from it: and be ye all ready.'
      v:005: 'JOS:8:5 | 5 | 5 | But I, and the rest of the multitude which is with
        me, will approach on the contrary side against the city. And when they shall
        come out against us, we will flee, and turn our backs, as we did before:'
      v:006: 'JOS:8:6 | 6 | 6 | Till they pursuing us be drawn farther from the city:
        for they will think that we flee as before.'
      v:007: 'JOS:8:7 | 7 | 7 | And whilst we are fleeing, and they pursuing, you
        shall rise out of the ambush, and shall destroy the city: and the Lord your
        God will deliver it into your hands.'
      v:008: JOS:8:8 | 8 | 8 | And when you shall have taken it, set it on fire, and
        you shall do all things so as I have commanded.
      v:009: JOS:8:9 | 9 | 9 | And he sent them away, and they went on to the place
        of the ambush, and abode between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the city
        of Hai. But Josue staid that night in the midst of the people,
      v:010: JOS:8:10 | 10 | 10 | And rising early in the morning, he mustered his
        soldiers, and went up with the ancients in the front of the army, environed
        with the aid of the fighting men.
      v:011: JOS:8:11 | 11 | 11 | And when they were come, and were gone up over against
        the city, they stood on the north side of the city, between which and them
        there was a valley in the midst.
      v:012: 'JOS:8:12 | 12 | 12 | And he had chosen five thousand men, and set them
        to lie in ambush between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the same city:'
      v:013: JOS:8:13 | 13 | 13 | But all the rest of the army went in battle array
        on the north side, so that the last of that multitude reached to the west
        side of the city. So Josue went that night, and stood in the midst of the
        valley.
      v:014: JOS:8:14 | 14 | 14 | And when the king of Hai saw this, he made haste
        in the morning, and went out with all the army of the city, and set it in
        battle array, toward the desert, not knowing that there lay an ambush behind
        his back.
      v:015: JOS:8:15 | 15 | 15 | But Josue, and all Israel gave back, making as if
        they were afraid, and fleeing by the way of the wilderness.
      v:016: JOS:8:16 | 16 | 16 | But they shouting together, and encouraging one
        another, pursued them. And when they were come from the city,
      v:017: JOS:8:17 | 17 | 17 | And not one remained in the city of Hai and of Bethel,
        that did not pursue after Israel, leaving the towns open as they had rushed
        out,
      v:018: 'JOS:8:18 | 18 | 18 | The Lord said to Josue: Lift up the shield that
        is in thy hand, towards the city of Hai, for I will deliver it to thee.'
      v:019: 'JOS:8:19 | 19 | 19 | And when he had lifted up his shield towards the
        city, the ambush, that lay hid, rose up immediately: and going to the city,
        took it, and set it on fire.'
      v:020: 'JOS:8:20 | 20 | 20 | And the men of the city, that pursued after Josue,
        looking back, and seeing the smoke of the city rise up to heaven, had no more
        power to flee this way or that way: especially as they that had counterfeited
        flight, and were going toward the wilderness, turned back most valiantly against
        them that pursued.'
      v:021: JOS:8:21 | 21 | 21 | So Josue, and all Israel, seeing that the city was
        taken, and that the smoke of the city rose up, returned, and slew the men
        of Hai.
      v:022: JOS:8:22 | 22 | 22 | And they also that had taken and set the city on
        fire, issuing out of the city to meet their own men, began to cut off the
        enemies who were surrounded by them. So that the enemies being cut off on
        both sides, not one of so great a multitude was saved.
      v:023: JOS:8:23 | 23 | 23 | And they took the king of the city of Hai alive
        and brought him to Josue.
      v:024: JOS:8:24 | 24 | 24 | So all being slain that had pursued after Israel,
        in his flight to the wilderness, and falling by the sword in the same place,
        the children of Israel returned and laid waste the city.
      v:025: JOS:8:25 | 25 | 25 | And the number of them that fell that day, both
        of men and women, was twelve thousand persons, all of the city of Hai.
      v:026: JOS:8:26 | 26 | 26 | But Josue drew not back his hand, which he had stretched
        out on high, holding the shield, till all the inhabitants of Hai were slain.
      v:027: JOS:8:27 | 27 | 27 | And the children of Israel divided among them, the
        cattle and the prey of the city, as the Lord had commanded Josue.
      v:028: 'JOS:8:28 | 28 | 28 | And he burnt the city, and made it a heap forever:'
      v:029: 'JOS:8:29 | 29 | 29 | And he hung the king thereof on a gibbet, until
        the evening and the going down of the sun. Then Josue commanded, and they
        took down his carcass from the gibbet: and threw it in the very entrance of
        the city, heaping upon it a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this
        present day.'
      v:030: JOS:8:30 | 30 | 30 | Then Josue built an altar to the Lord, the God of
        Israel, in Mount Hebal,
      v:031: 'JOS:8:31 | 31 | 31 | As Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded
        the children of Israel, and it is written in the book of the law of Moses:
        an altar of unhewn stones, which iron had not touched: and he offered upon
        it holocausts to the Lord, and immolated victims of peace offerings.'
      v:032: JOS:8:32 | 32 | 32 | And he wrote upon stones, the Deuteronomy of the
        law of Moses, which he had ordered before the children of Israel.
      v:033: JOS:8:33 | 33 | 33 | And all the people, and the ancients, and the princes,
        and judges, stood on both sides of the ark, before the priests that carried
        the ark of the covenant of the Lord, both the stranger and he that was born
        among them, half of them by Mount Garizim, and half by Mount Hebal, as Moses
        the servant of the Lord, had commanded. And first he blessed the people of
        Israel.
      v:034: JOS:8:34 | 34 | 34 | After this, he read all the words of the blessing
        and the cursing, and all things that were written in the book of the law.
      v:035: JOS:8:35 | 35 | 35 | He left out nothing of those things which Moses
        had commanded, but he repeated all before all the people of Israel, with the
        women and children, and strangers, that dwelt among them.

      v:007: JOS:9:7 | 7 | 7 | Perhaps you dwell in the land which falls to our lot;
        if so, we can make no league with you.
      v:008: 'JOS:9:8 | 8 | 8 | But they said to Josue: We are thy servants. Josue
        said to them: Who are you? and whence came you?'
      v:009: 'JOS:9:9 | 9 | 9 | They answered: From a very far country thy servants
        are come in the name of the Lord thy God. for we have heard the fame of his
        power, all the things that he did in Egypt.'
      v:010: 'JOS:9:10 | 10 | 10 | And to the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were
        beyond the Jordan, Sehon, king of Hesebon, and Og, king of Basan, that was
        in Astaroth:'
      v:011: 'JOS:9:11 | 11 | 11 | And our ancients, and all the inhabitants of our
        country, said to us: Take with you victuals for a long way, and go meet them,
        and say: We are your servants, make ye a league with us.'
      v:012: JOS:9:12 | 12 | 12 | Behold, these loaves we took hot, when we set out
        from our houses to come to you, now they are become dry, and broken in pieces
        by being exceeding old.
      v:013: JOS:9:13 | 13 | 13 | These bottles of wine when we filled them were new,
        now they are rent and burst. These garments we have on, and the shoes we have
        on our feet, by reason of the very long journey, are worn out, and almost
        consumed.
      v:014: JOS:9:14 | 14 | 14 | They took therefore of their victuals, and consulted
        not the mouth of the Lord.
      v:015: 'JOS:9:15 | 15 | 15 | And Josue made peace with them, and entering into
        a league, promised that they should not be slain: the princes also of the
        multitude swore to them.'
      v:016: JOS:9:16 | 16 | 16 | Now three days after the league was made, they heard
        that they dwelt nigh, and they should be among them.
      v:017: JOS:9:17 | 17 | 17 | And the children of Israel removed the camp, and
        came into their cities on the third day, the names of which are, Gabaon, and
        Caphira, and Beroth, and Cariathiarim.
      v:018: JOS:9:18 | 18 | 18 | And they slew them not, because the princes of the
        multitude had sworn in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. Then all the
        common people murmured against the princes.
      v:019: 'JOS:9:19 | 19 | 19 | And they answered them: We have sworn to them in
        the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, and therefore we may not touch them.'
      v:020: 'JOS:9:20 | 20 | 20 | But this we will do to them: Let their lives be
        saved, lest the wrath of the Lord be stirred up against us, if we should be
        forsworn:'
      v:021: JOS:9:21 | 21 | 21 | But so let them live, as to serve the whole multitude
        in hewing wood, and bringing in water. As they were speaking these things,
      v:022: 'JOS:9:22 | 22 | 22 | Josue called the Gabaonites, and said to them:
        Why would you impose upon us, saying: We dwell very far off from you, whereas
        you are in the midst of us?'
      v:023: JOS:9:23 | 23 | 23 | Therefore you shall be under a curse, and your race
        shall always be hewers of wood, and carriers of water, into the house of my
        God.
      v:024: 'JOS:9:24 | 24 | 24 | They answered: It was told us, thy servants, that
        the Lord thy God had promised his servant Moses, to give you all the land,
        and to destroy all the inhabitants thereof. Therefore we feared exceedingly
        and provided for our lives, compelled by the dread we had of you, and we took
        this counsel.'
      v:025: 'JOS:9:25 | 25 | 25 | And now we are in thy hand: deal with us as it
        seemeth good and right unto thee.'
      v:026: JOS:9:26 | 26 | 26 | So Josue did as he had said, and delivered them
        from the hand of the children of Israel, that they should not be slain.
      v:027: JOS:9:27 | 27 | 27 | And he gave orders in that day, that they should
        be in the service of all the people, and of the altar of the Lord, hewing
        wood, and carrying water, until this present time, in the place which the
        Lord hath chosen.
  c:010:
    intro: 'Five kings war against Gabaon. Josue defeateth them: many are slain with
      hailstones. At the prayer of Josue the sun and moon stand still the space of
      one day. The five kings are hanged. Divers cities are taken.'
    verses:
      v:001: JOS:10:1 | 1 | 1 | When Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, had heard these
        things, to wit, that Josue had taken Hai, and had destroyed it, (for as he
        had done to Jericho and the king thereof, so did he to Hai and its king) and
        that the Gabaonites were gone over to Israel, and were their confederates,
      v:002: JOS:10:2 | 2 | 2 | He was exceedingly afraid. for Gabaon was a great
        city, and one of the royal cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and all
        its fighting men were most valiant.
      v:003: 'JOS:10:3 | 3 | 3 | Therefore Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, sent to
        Oham, king of Hebron, and to Pharam, king of Jerimoth, and to Japhia, king
        of Lachis, and to Dabir, king of Eglon, saying:'
      v:004: JOS:10:4 | 4 | 4 | Come up to me, and bring help, that we may take Gabaon,
        because it hath gone over to Josue, and to the children of Israel.
      v:005: 'JOS:10:5 | 5 | 5 | So the five kings of the Amorrhites being assembled
        together, went up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of
        Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, they and their armies, and
        camped about Gabaon, laying siege to it.'
      v:006: 'JOS:10:6 | 6 | 6 | But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon, which
        was besieged, sent to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said
        to him: Withdraw not thy hands from helping thy servants: come up quickly,
        and save us, and bring us succour: for all the kings of the Amorrhites, who
        dwell in the mountains, are gathered together against us.'
      v:007: JOS:10:7 | 7 | 7 | And Josue went up from Galgal, and all the army of
        the warriors with him, most valiant men.
      v:008: 'JOS:10:8 | 8 | 8 | But the Lord said to Josue: Fear them not: for I
        have delivered them into thy hands: none of them shall be able to stand against
        thee.'
      v:009: JOS:10:9 | 9 | 9 | So Josue going up from Galgal all the night, came
        upon them suddenly.
      v:010: 'JOS:10:10 | 10 | 10 | And the Lord troubled them, at the sight of Israel:
        and he slew them with a great slaughter, in Gabaon, and pursued them by the
        way of the ascent to Bethoron, and cut them off all the way to Azeca and Maceda.'
      v:011: 'JOS:10:11 | 11 | 11 | And when they were fleeing from the children of
        Israel, and were in the descent of Bethoron, the Lord cast down upon them
        great stones from heaven, as far as Azeca: and many more were killed with
        the hailstones, than were slain by the swords of the children of Israel,'
      v:012: 'JOS:10:12 | 12 | 12 | Then Josue spoke to the Lord, in the day that
        he delivered the Amorrhite in the sight of the children of Israel, and he
        said before them: Move not, O sun, toward Gabaon, nor thou, O moon, toward
        the valley of Ajalon.'
      v:013: JOS:10:13 | 13 | 13 | And the sun and the moon stood still, till the
        people revenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book
        of the just? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not
        to go down the space of one day.
      v:014: JOS:10:14 | 14 | 14 | There was not before, nor after, so long a day,
        the Lord obeying the voice of a man, and fighting for Israel.
      v:015: JOS:10:15 | 15 | 15 | And Josue returned, with all Israel, into the camp
        of Galgal.
      v:016: JOS:10:16 | 16 | 16 | For the five kings were fled, and had hid themselves
        in a cave of the city of Maceda.
      v:017: JOS:10:17 | 17 | 17 | And it was told Josue, that the five kings were
        found hid in a cave of the city of Maceda.
      v:018: 'JOS:10:18 | 18 | 18 | And he commanded them that were with him, saying:
        Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set careful men to keep them
        shut up:'
      v:019: JOS:10:19 | 19 | 19 | And stay you not, but pursue after the enemies,
        and kill all the hindermost of them as they flee, and do not suffer them whom
        the Lord God hath delivered into your hands, to shelter themselves in their
        cities.
      v:020: JOS:10:20 | 20 | 20 | So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter,
        and almost utterly consumed, they that were able to escape from Israel, entered
        into fenced cities.
      v:021: 'JOS:10:21 | 21 | 21 | And all the army returned to Josue, in Maceda,
        where the camp then was, in good health, and without the loss of any one:
        and no man durst move his tongue against the children of Israel.'
      v:022: 'JOS:10:22 | 22 | 22 | And Josue gave orders, saying: Open the mouth
        of the cave, and bring forth to me the five kings that lie hid therein.'
      v:023: 'JOS:10:23 | 23 | 23 | And the ministers did as they were commanded:
        and they brought out to him the five kings out of the cave: the king of Jerusalem,
        the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of
        Eglon.'
      v:024: 'JOS:10:24 | 24 | 24 | And when they were brought out to him, he called
        all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the army that were with him:
        Go, and set your feet on the necks of these kings. And when they had gone,
        and put their feet upon the necks of them lying under them,'
      v:025: 'JOS:10:25 | 25 | 25 | He said again to them: Fear not, neither be ye
        dismayed, take courage, and be strong: for so will the Lord do to all your
        enemies, against whom you fight.'
      v:026: JOS:10:26 | 26 | 26 | And Josue struck, and slew them, and hanged them
        upon five gibbets; and they hung until the evening.
      v:027: JOS:10:27 | 27 | 27 | And when the sun was down, he commanded the soldiers
        to take them down from the gibbets. And after they were taken down, they cast
        them into the cave, where they had lain hid, and put great stones at the mouth
        thereof, which remain until this day.
      v:028: 'JOS:10:28 | 28 | 28 | The same day Josue took Maceda, and destroyed
        it with the edge of the sword, and killed the king and all the inhabitants
        thereof: he left not in it the least remains. And he did to the king of Maceda,
        as he had done to the king of Jericho.'
      v:029: 'JOS:10:29 | 29 | 29 | And he passed from Maceda with all Israel to Lebna,
        and fought against it:'
      v:030: 'JOS:10:30 | 30 | 30 | And the Lord delivered it with the king thereof
        into the hands of Israel: and they destroyed the city with the edge of the
        sword, and all the inhabitants thereof. They left not in it any remains. And
        they did to the king of Lebna, as they had done to the king of Jericho.'
      v:031: 'JOS:10:31 | 31 | 31 | From Lebna he passed unto Lachis, with all Israel:
        and investing it with his army, besieged it.'
      v:032: JOS:10:32 | 32 | 32 | And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of
        Israel, and he took it the following day, and put it to the sword, and every
        soul that was in it, as he had done to Lebna.
      v:033: 'JOS:10:33 | 33 | 33 | At that time Horam, king of Gazer, came up to
        succour Lachis: and Josue slew him with all his people so as to leave none
        alive.'
      v:034: JOS:10:34 | 34 | 34 | And he passed from Lachis to Eglon, and surrounded
        it,
      v:035: 'JOS:10:35 | 35 | 35 | And took it the same day: and put to the sword
        all the souls that were in it, according to all that he had done to Lachis.'
      v:036: 'JOS:10:36 | 36 | 36 | He went up also with all Israel from Eglon to
        Hebron, and fought against it:'
      v:037: 'JOS:10:37 | 37 | 37 | Took it, and destroyed it with the edge of the
        sword: the king also thereof, and all the towns of that country, and all the
        souls that dwelt in it: he left not therein any remains: as he had done to
        Eglon, so did he also to Hebron, putting to the sword all that he found in
        it.'
      v:038: JOS:10:38 | 38 | 38 | Returning from thence to Dabir,
      v:039: 'JOS:10:39 | 39 | 39 | He took it, and destroyed it: the king also thereof,
        and all the towns round about, he destroyed with the edge of the sword: he
        left not in it any remains: as he had done to Hebron and Lebna, and to their
        kings, so did he to Dabir, and to the king thereof.'
      v:040: 'JOS:10:40 | 40 | 40 | So Josue conquered all the country of the hills,
        and of the south, and of the plain, and of Asedoth, with their kings: he left
        not any remains therein, but slew all that breathed, as the Lord, the God
        of Israel, had commanded him.'
      v:041: JOS:10:41 | 41 | 41 | From Cadesbarne even to Gaza. All the land of Gosen
        even to Gabaon,
      v:042: 'JOS:10:42 | 42 | 42 | And all their kings, and their lands he took and
        wasted at one onset: for the Lord the God of Israel fought for him.'
      v:043: JOS:10:43 | 43 | 43 | And he returned with all Israel to the place of
        the camp in Galgal.
  c:011:
    intro: 'The kings of the north are overthrown: the whole country is taken.'
    verses:
      v:001: 'JOS:11:1 | 1 | 1 | And when Jabin king of Asor had heard these things,
        he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Semeron, and to the king
        of Achsaph:'
      v:002: 'JOS:11:2 | 2 | 2 | And to the kings of the north, that dwelt in the
        mountains and in the plains over against the south side of Ceneroth, and in
        the levels and the countries of Dor by the sea side:'
      v:003: 'JOS:11:3 | 3 | 3 | To the Chanaanites also on the east and on the west,
        and the Amorrhite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Jebusite in
        the mountains: to the Hevite also who dwelt at the foot of Hermon in the land
        of Maspha.'
      v:004: JOS:11:4 | 4 | 4 | And they all came out with their troops, a people
        exceeding numerous as the sand that is on the sea shore, their horses also
        and chariots a very great multitude,
      v:005: JOS:11:5 | 5 | 5 | And all these kings assembled together at the waters
        of Merom, to fight against Israel.
      v:006: 'JOS:11:6 | 6 | 6 | And the Lord said to Josue: Fear them not: for to
        morrow at this same hour I will deliver all these to be slain in the sight
        of Israel: thou shalt hamstring their horses, and thou shalt burn their chariots
        with fire.'
      v:007: JOS:11:7 | 7 | 7 | And Josue came, and all the army with him, against
        them to the waters of Merom on a sudden, and fell upon them.
      v:008: 'JOS:11:8 | 8 | 8 | And the Lord delivered them into the hands of Israel.
        And they defeated them, and chased them as far as the great Sidon and the
        waters of Maserophot, and the field of Masphe, which is on the east thereof.
        He slew them all, so as to leave no remains of them:'
      v:009: JOS:11:9 | 9 | 9 | And he did as the Lord had commanded him, he hamstringed
        their horses and burned their chariots.
      v:010: 'JOS:11:10 | 10 | 10 | And presently turning back he took Asor: and slew
        the king thereof with the sword. Now Asor of old was the head of all these
        kingdoms.'
      v:011: 'JOS:11:11 | 11 | 11 | And he cut off all the souls that abode there:
        he left not in it any remains, but utterly destroyed all, and burned the city
        itself with fire.'
      v:012: JOS:11:12 | 12 | 12 | And he took and put to the sword and destroyed
        all the cities round about, and their kings, as Moses the servant of God had
        commanded him.
      v:013: 'JOS:11:13 | 13 | 13 | Except the cities that were on hills and high
        places, the rest Israel burned: only Asor that was very strong he consumed
        with fire.'
      v:014: JOS:11:14 | 14 | 14 | And the children of Israel divided among themselves
        all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, killing all the men.
      v:015: 'JOS:11:15 | 15 | 15 | As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so
        did Moses command Josue, and he accomplished all: he left not one thing undone
        of all the commandments which the Lord had commanded Moses.'
      v:016: 'JOS:11:16 | 16 | 16 | So Josue took all the country of the hills, and
        of the south, and the land of Gosen, and the plains and the west country,
        and the mountain of Israel, and the plains thereof:'
      v:017: 'JOS:11:17 | 17 | 17 | And part of the mountain that goeth up to Seir
        as far as Baalgad, by the plain of Libanus under mount Hermon: all their kings
        he took, smote and slew.'
      v:018: JOS:11:18 | 18 | 18 | Josue made war a long time against these kings.
      v:019: 'JOS:11:19 | 19 | 19 | There was not a city that delivered itself to
        the children of Israel, except the Hevite, who dwelt in Gabaon: for he took
        all by fight.'
      v:020: JOS:11:20 | 20 | 20 | For it was the sentence of the Lord, that their
        hearts should be hardened, and they should fight against Israel, and fall,
        and should not deserve any clemency, and should be destroyed as the Lord had
        commanded Moses.
      v:021: JOS:11:21 | 21 | 21 | At that time Josue came and cut off the Enacims
        from the mountains, from Hebron, and Dabir, and Anab, and from all the mountain
        of Juda and Israel, and destroyed their cities.
      v:022: 'JOS:11:22 | 22 | 22 | He left not any of the stock of the Enacims, in
        the land of the children of Israel: except the cities of Gaza, and Geth, and
        Azotus, in which alone they were left.'
      v:023: JOS:11:23 | 23 | 23 | So Josue took all the land, as the Lord spoke to
        Moses, and delivered it in possession to the children of Israel, according
        to their divisions and tribes. And the land rested from wars.
  c:012:
    intro: A list of the kings slain by Moses and Josue,
    verses:
      v:001: JOS:12:1 | 1 | 1 | These are the kings, whom the children of Israel slew
        and possessed their land beyond the Jordan towards the rising of the sun,
        from the torrent Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the east country that looketh
        towards the wilderness.
      v:002: JOS:12:2 | 2 | 2 | Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon,
        and had dominion from Aroer, which is seated upon the bank of the torrent
        Arnon, and of the middle part in the valley, and of half Galaad, as far as
        the torrent Jaboc, which is the border of the children of Ammon.
      v:003: 'JOS:12:3 | 3 | 3 | And from the wilderness, to the sea of Ceneroth towards
        the east, and to the sea of the wilderness, which is the most salt sea, on
        the east side by the way that leadeth to Bethsimoth: and on the south side
        that lieth under Asedoth, Phasga.'
      v:004: JOS:12:4 | 4 | 4 | The border of Og the king of Basan, of the remnant
        of the Raphaims who dwelt in Astaroth, and in Edrai, and had dominion in mount
        Hermon, and in Salecha, and in all Basan, unto the borders
      v:005: 'JOS:12:5 | 5 | 5 | Of Gessuri and Machati, and of half Galaad: the borders
        of Sehon the king of Hesebon.'
      v:006: JOS:12:6 | 6 | 6 | Moses the servant of the Lord, and the children of
        Israel slew them, and Moses delivered their land in possession to the Rubenites,
        and Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses.
      v:007: 'JOS:12:7 | 7 | 7 | These are the kings of the land, whom Josue and the
        children of Israel slew beyond the Jordan on the west side from Baalgad in
        the field of Libanus, unto the mount, part of which goeth up into Seir: and

      v:004: JOS:16:4 | 4 | 4 | And Manasses and Ephraim the children of Joseph possessed
        it.
      v:005: 'JOS:16:5 | 5 | 5 | And the border of the children of Ephraim was according
        to their kindreds: and their possession towards the east was Ataroth-addar
        unto Beth-horon the upper.'
      v:006: 'JOS:16:6 | 6 | 6 | And the confines go out unto the sea: but Machmethath
        looketh to the north, and it goeth round the borders eastward into Thanath-selo:
        and passeth along on the east side to Janoe.'
      v:007: 'JOS:16:7 | 7 | 7 | And it goeth down from Janoe into Ataroth and Naaratha:

      v:008: JOS:16:8 | 8 | 8 | From Taphua it passeth on towards the sea into the

      v:009: JOS:16:9 | 9 | 9 | And there were cities with their villages separated
        for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the possession of the children
        of Manasses.
      v:010: 'JOS:16:10 | 10 | 10 | And the children of Ephraim slew not the Chanaanite,

  c:017:
    intro: The lot of the half tribe of Manasses.
    verses:
      v:001: JOS:17:1 | 1 | 1 | And this lot fell to the tribe of Manasses for he
        is the firstborn of Joseph to Machir the firstborn of Manasses the father
        of Galaad, who was a warlike man, and had for possession Galaad and Basan.
      v:002: 'JOS:17:2 | 2 | 2 | And to the rest of the children of Manasses according
        to their families: to the children of Abiezer, and to the children of Helec,
        and to the children of Esriel, and to the children of Sechem, and to the children
        of Hepher, and to the children of Semida: these are the male children of Manasses
        the son of Joseph, by their kindreds.'
      v:003: 'JOS:17:3 | 3 | 3 | But Salphaad the son of Hepher the son of Galaad
        the son of Machir the son of Manasses had no sons, but only daughters: whose
        names are these, Maala and Noa and Hegla and Melcha and Thersa.'
      v:004: 'JOS:17:4 | 4 | 4 | And they came in the presence of Eleazar the priest
        and of Josue the son of Nun, and of the princes, saying: The Lord commanded
        by the hand of Moses, that a possession should be given us in the midst of
        our brethren. And he gave them according to the commandment of the Lord a
        possession amongst the brethren of their father.'
      v:005: JOS:17:5 | 5 | 5 | And there fell ten portions to Manasses, beside the
        land of Galaad and Basan beyond the Jordan.
      v:006: JOS:17:6 | 6 | 6 | For the daughters of Manasses possessed inheritance
        in the midst of his sons. And the land of Galaad fell to the lot of the rest
        of the children of Manasses.
      v:007: 'JOS:17:7 | 7 | 7 | And the border of Manasses was from Aser, Machmethath
        which looketh towards Sichem: and it goeth out on the right hand by the inhabitants
        of the fountain of Taphua.'
      v:008: JOS:17:8 | 8 | 8 | For the lot of Manasses took in the land of Taphua,
        which is on the borders of Manasses, and belongs to the children of Ephraim.
      v:009: 'JOS:17:9 | 9 | 9 | And the border goeth down to the valley of the reeds,
        to the south of the torrent of the cities of Ephraim, which are in the midst
        of the cities of Manasses: the border of Manasses is on the north side of
        the torrent, and the outgoings of it are at the sea:'
      v:010: JOS:17:10 | 10 | 10 | So that the possession of Ephraim is on the south,
        and on the north that of Manasses, and the sea is the border of both, and
        they are joined together in the tribe of Aser on the north, and in the tribe
        of Issachar on the east.
      v:011: 'JOS:17:11 | 11 | 11 | And the inheritance of Manasses in Issachar and
        in Aser, was Bethsan and its villages, and Jeblaam with its villages, and
        the inhabitants of Dor, with the towns thereof: the inhabitants also of Endor
        with the villages thereof: and in like manner the inhabitants of Thenac with
        the villages thereof: and the inhabitants of Mageddo with their villages,
        and the third part of the city of Nopheth.'
      v:012: JOS:17:12 | 12 | 12 | Neither could the children of Manasses overthrow
        these cities, but the Chanaanite began to dwell in his land.
      v:013: JOS:17:13 | 13 | 13 | But after that the children of Israel were grown
        strong, they subdued the Chanaanites, and made them their tributaries, and
        they did not kill them.
      v:014: 'JOS:17:14 | 14 | 14 | And the children of Joseph spoke to Josue, and
        said: Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to possess, whereas
        I am of so great a multitude, and the Lord hath blessed me?'
      v:015: 'JOS:17:15 | 15 | 15 | And Josue said to them: If thou be a great people,
        go up into the woodland, and cut down room for thyself in the land of the
        Pherezite and the Raphaims: because the possession of mount Ephraim is too
        narrow for thee.'
      v:016: 'JOS:17:16 | 16 | 16 | And the children of Joseph answered him: We cannot
        go up to the mountains, for the Chanaanites that dwell in the low lands, wherein
        are situate Bethsan with its towns, and Jezrael in the midst of the valley,
        have chariots of iron.'
      v:017: 'JOS:17:17 | 17 | 17 | And Josue said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim
        and Manasses: Thou art a great people, and of great strength, thou shalt not
        have one lot only:'
      v:018: 'JOS:17:18 | 18 | 18 | But thou shalt pass to the mountain, and shalt
        cut down the wood, and make thyself room to dwell in: and mayst proceed farther,
        when thou hast destroyed the Chanaanites, who as thou sayest have iron chariots,
        and are very strong.'

    verses:
      v:001: JOS:18:1 | 1 | 1 | And all the children of Israel assembled together
        in Silo, and there they set up the tabernacle of the testimony, and the land
        was subdued before them.
      v:002: JOS:18:2 | 2 | 2 | But there remained seven tribes of the children of
        Israel, which as yet had not received their possessions.
      v:003: 'JOS:18:3 | 3 | 3 | And Josue said to them: How long are you indolent
        and slack, and go not in to possess the land which the Lord the God of your
        fathers hath given you?'
      v:004: 'JOS:18:4 | 4 | 4 | Choose of every tribe three men, that I may send
        them, and they may go and compass the land, and mark it out according to the
        number of each multitude: and bring back to me what they have marked out.'
      v:005: 'JOS:18:5 | 5 | 5 | Divide to yourselves the land into seven parts: let
        Juda be in his bounds on the south side, and the house of Joseph on the north.'
      v:006: JOS:18:6 | 6 | 6 | The land in the midst between these mark ye out into
        seven parts; and you shall come hither to me, that I may cast lots for you
        before the Lord your God.
      v:007: 'JOS:18:7 | 7 | 7 | For the Levites have no part among you, but the priesthood
        of the Lord is their inheritance. And Gad and Ruben, and the half tribe of
        Manasses have already received their possessions beyond the Jordan eastward:
        which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them.'
      v:008: 'JOS:18:8 | 8 | 8 | And when the men were risen up, to go to mark out
        the land, Josue commanded them saying: Go round the land and mark it out,
        and return to me: that I may cast lots for you before the Lord in Silo.'
      v:009: JOS:18:9 | 9 | 9 | So they went and surveying it divided it into seven
        parts, writing them down in a book. And they returned to Josue, to the camp
        in Silo.
      v:010: JOS:18:10 | 10 | 10 | And he cast lots before the Lord in Silo, and divided
        the land to the children of Israel into seven parts.
      v:011: JOS:18:11 | 11 | 11 | And first came up the lot of the children of Benjamin

      answer.
    verses:
      v:001: JOS:22:1 | 1 | 1 | At the same time Josue called the Rubenites, and the
        Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses,
      v:002: 'JOS:22:2 | 2 | 2 | And said to them: You have done all that Moses the
        servant of the Lord commanded you: you have also obeyed me in all things,'
      v:003: JOS:22:3 | 3 | 3 | Neither have you left your brethren this long time,
        until this present day, keeping the commandment of the Lord your God.
      v:004: 'JOS:22:4 | 4 | 4 | Therefore as the Lord your God hath given your brethren
        rest and peace, as he promised: return, and go to your dwellings, and to the
        land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond
        the Jordan:'
      v:005: 'JOS:22:5 | 5 | 5 | Yet so that you observe attentively, and in work
        fulfil the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded
        you: that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, and keep all
        his commandments, and cleave to him, and serve him with all your heart, and
        with all your soul.'
      v:006: JOS:22:6 | 6 | 6 | And Josue blessed them, and sent them away, and they
        returned to their dwellings.
      v:007: 'JOS:22:7 | 7 | 7 | Now to half the tribe of Manasses, Moses had given
        a possession in Basan: and therefore to the half that remained, Josue gave
        a lot among the rest of their brethren beyond the Jordan to the west. And
        when he sent them away to their dwellings and had blessed them,'
      v:008: 'JOS:22:8 | 8 | 8 | He said to them: With much substance and riches,
        you return to your settlements, with silver and gold, brass and iron, and
        variety of raiment: divide the prey of your enemies with your brethren.'
      v:009: JOS:22:9 | 9 | 9 | So the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad,
        and the half tribe of Manasses returned, and parted from the children of Israel
        in Silo, which is in Chanaan, to go into Galaad the land of their possession,
        which they had obtained according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand
        of Moses.
      v:010: JOS:22:10 | 10 | 10 | And when they were come to the banks of the Jordan,
        in the land of Chanaan, they built an altar immensely great near the Jordan.

        and certain messengers brought them an account that the children of Ruben,
        and of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses had built an altar in the land
        of Chanaan, upon the banks of the Jordan, over against the children of Israel:'
      v:012: JOS:22:12 | 12 | 12 | They all assembled in Silo, to go up and fight
        against them.
      v:013: JOS:22:13 | 13 | 13 | And in the mean time they sent to them into the
        land of Galaad, Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest,

        this transgression? Why have you forsaken the Lord the God of Israel, building
        a sacrilegious altar, and revolting from the worship of him?'
      v:017: JOS:22:17 | 17 | 17 | Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with
        Beelphegor, and the stain of that crime remaineth in us to this day? and many
        of the people perished.
      v:018: JOS:22:18 | 18 | 18 | And you have forsaken the Lord to day, and to morrow
        his wrath will rage against all Israel.
      v:019: 'JOS:22:19 | 19 | 19 | But if you think the land of your possession to
        be unclean, pass over to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the Lord, and
        dwell among us: only depart not from the Lord, and from our society, by building
        an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God.'
      v:020: JOS:22:20 | 20 | 20 | Did not Achan the son of Zare transgress the commandment
        of the Lord, and his wrath lay upon all the people of Israel? And he was but
        one man, and would to God he alone had perished in his wickedness.
      v:021: 'JOS:22:21 | 21 | 21 | And the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and of
        the half tribe of Manasses answered the princes of the embassage of Israel:'
      v:022: 'JOS:22:22 | 22 | 22 | The Lord the most mighty God, the Lord the most
        mighty God, he knoweth, and Israel also shall understand: If with the design
        of transgression we have set up this altar, let him not save us, but punish
        us immediately:'
      v:023: 'JOS:22:23 | 23 | 23 | And if we did it with that mind, that we might
        lay upon it holocausts, and sacrifice, and victims of peace offerings, let
        him require and judge:'
      v:024: 'JOS:22:24 | 24 | 24 | And not rather with this thought and design, that
        we should say: To morrow your children will say to our children: What have
        you to do with the Lord the God of Israel?'
      v:025: 'JOS:22:25 | 25 | 25 | The Lord hath put the river Jordan for a border
        between us and you, O ye children of Ruben, and ye children of Gad: and therefore
        you have no part in the Lord. And by this occasion your children shall turn
        away our children from the fear of the Lord. We therefore thought it best,'
      v:026: 'JOS:22:26 | 26 | 26 | And said: Let us build us an altar, not for holocausts,
        nor to offer victims,'
      v:027: 'JOS:22:27 | 27 | 27 | But for a testimony between us and you, and our
        posterity and yours, that we may serve the Lord, and that we may have a right
        to offer both holocausts, and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings: and
        that your children to morrow may not say to our children: You have no part
        in the Lord.'
      v:028: 'JOS:22:28 | 28 | 28 | And if they will say so, they shall answer them:
        Behold the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for holocausts,
        nor for sacrifice, but for a testimony between us and you.'
      v:029: JOS:22:29 | 29 | 29 | God keep us from any such wickedness that we should
        revolt from the Lord, and leave off following his steps, by building an altar
        to offer holocausts, and sacrifices, and victims, beside the altar of the
        Lord our God, which is erected before his tabernacle.
      v:030: 'JOS:22:30 | 30 | 30 | And when Phinees the priest, and the princes of
        the embassage, who were with him, had heard this, they were satisfied: and
        they admitted most willingly the words of the children of Ruben, and Gad,
        and of the half tribe of Manasses,'
      v:031: 'JOS:22:31 | 31 | 31 | And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said
        to them: Now we know that the Lord is with us, because you are not guilty
        of this revolt, and you have delivered the children of Israel from the hand
        of the Lord.'
      v:032: JOS:22:32 | 32 | 32 | And he returned with the princes from the children
        of Ruben and Gad, out of the land of Galaad, into the land of Chanaan, to
        the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
      v:033: JOS:22:33 | 33 | 33 | And the saying pleased all that heard it. And the
        children of Israel praised God, and they no longer said that they would go
        up against them, and fight, and destroy the land of their possession.
      v:034: JOS:22:34 | 34 | 34 | And the children of Ruben, and the children of
        Gad called the altar which they had built, Our testimony, that the Lord is
        God.

      v:015: 'JOS:23:15 | 15 | 15 | Therefore as he hath fulfilled in deed, what he
        promised, and all things prosperous have come: so will he bring upon you all
        the evils he hath threatened, till he take you away and destroy you from off
        this excellent land, which he hath given you,'
      v:016: 'JOS:23:16 | 16 | 16 | When you shall have transgressed the covenant
        of the Lord your God, which he hath made with you, and shall have served strange
        gods, and adored them: then shall the indignation of the Lord rise up quickly
        and speedily against you, and you shall be taken away from this excellent
        land, which he hath delivered to you.'
  c:024:
    intro: Josue assembleth the people, and reneweth the covenant between them and

        in Sichem, and called for the ancients, and the princes and the judges, and
        the masters: and they stood in the sight of the Lord:'
      v:002: 'JOS:24:2 | 2 | 2 | And he spoke thus to the people: Thus saith the Lord
        the God of Israel: Your fathers dwelt of old on the other side of the river,
        Thare the father of Abraham, and Nachor: and they served strange gods.'
      v:003: 'JOS:24:3 | 3 | 3 | And I took your father Abraham from the borders of
        Mesopotamia: and brought him into the land of Chanaan: and I multiplied his
        seed,'
      v:004: 'JOS:24:4 | 4 | 4 | And gave him Isaac: and to him again I gave Jacob
        and Esau. And I gave to Esau mount Seir for his possession: but Jacob and
        his children went down into Egypt.'
      v:005: JOS:24:5 | 5 | 5 | And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt with
        many signs and wonders.
      v:006: 'JOS:24:6 | 6 | 6 | And I brought you and your fathers out of Egypt,
        and you came to the sea: and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots
        and horsemen, as far as the Red Sea.'
      v:007: 'JOS:24:7 | 7 | 7 | And the children of Israel cried to the Lord: and
        he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them,
        and covered them. Your eyes saw all that I did in Egypt, and you dwelt in
        the wilderness a long time.'
      v:008: JOS:24:8 | 8 | 8 | And I brought you into the land of the Amorrhite,
        who dwelt beyond the Jordan. And when they fought against you, I delivered
        them into your hands, and you possessed their land, and slew them.
      v:009: 'JOS:24:9 | 9 | 9 | And Balac son of Sephor king of Moab arose and fought
        against Israel. And he sent and called for Balaam son of Beor, to curse you:'
      v:010: JOS:24:10 | 10 | 10 | And I would not hear him, but on the contrary I
        blessed you by him, and I delivered you out of his hand.
      v:011: 'JOS:24:11 | 11 | 11 | And you passed over the Jordan, and you came to
        Jericho. And the men of that city fought against you, the Amorrhite, and the
        Pherezite, and the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Gergesite, and the
        Hevite, and the Jebusite: and I delivered them into your hands.'
      v:012: 'JOS:24:12 | 12 | 12 | And I sent before you hornets: and I drove them
        out from their places, the two kings of the Amorrhites, not with thy sword
        nor with thy bow,'
      v:013: JOS:24:13 | 13 | 13 | And I gave you a land, in which you had not laboured,
        and cities to dwell in which you built not, vineyards and oliveyards, which
        you planted not.
      v:014: 'JOS:24:14 | 14 | 14 | Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him with
        a perfect and most sincere heart: and put away the gods which your fathers
        served in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve the Lord.'
      v:015: 'JOS:24:15 | 15 | 15 | But if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord,
        you have your choice: choose this day that which pleaseth you, whom you would
        rather serve, whether the gods which your fathers served in Mesopotamia, or
        the gods of the Amorrhites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my
        house we will serve the Lord,'
      v:016: JOS:24:16 | 16 | 16 | And the people answered, and said, God forbid we
        should leave the Lord, and serve strange gods.
      v:017: 'JOS:24:17 | 17 | 17 | The Lord our God he brought us and our fathers
        out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: and did very great
        signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way by which we journeyed,
        and among all the people through whom we passed.'
      v:018: JOS:24:18 | 18 | 18 | And he hath cast out all the nations, the Amorrhite
        the inhabitant of the land into which we are come. Therefore we will serve
        the Lord, for he is our God.
      v:019: 'JOS:24:19 | 19 | 19 | And Josue said to the people: You will not be
        able to serve the Lord: for he is a holy God, and mighty and jealous, and
        will not forgive your wickedness and sins.'
      v:020: JOS:24:20 | 20 | 20 | If you leave the Lord, and serve strange gods,
        he will turn, and will afflict you, and will destroy you after all the good
        he hath done you.
      v:021: 'JOS:24:21 | 21 | 21 | And the people said to Josue: No, it shall not
        be so as thou sayest, but we will serve the Lord.'
      v:022: 'JOS:24:22 | 22 | 22 | And Josue said to the people, You are witnesses,
        that you yourselves have chosen you the Lord to serve him. And they answered:
        We are witnesses.'
      v:023: JOS:24:23 | 23 | 23 | Now therefore, said he, put away strange gods from
        among you, and incline your hearts to the Lord the God of Israel.
      v:024: 'JOS:24:24 | 24 | 24 | And the people said to Josue: We will serve the
        Lord our God, and we will be obedient to his commandments.'
      v:025: JOS:24:25 | 25 | 25 | Josue therefore on that day made a covenant, and
        set before the people commandments and judgments in Sichem.
      v:026: 'JOS:24:26 | 26 | 26 | And he wrote all these things in the volume of
        the law of the Lord: and he took a great stone, and set it under the oak that
        was in the sanctuary of the Lord.'
      v:027: 'JOS:24:27 | 27 | 27 | And he said to all the people: Behold this stone
        shall be a testimony unto you, that it hath heard all the words of the Lord,
        which he hath spoken to you: lest perhaps hereafter you will deny it, and
        lie to the Lord your God.'
      v:028: JOS:24:28 | 28 | 28 | And he sent the people away every one to their
        own possession,
      v:029: 'JOS:24:29 | 29 | 29 | And after these things Josue the son of Nun the
        servant of the Lord died, being a hundred and ten years old:'
      v:030: JOS:24:30 | 30 | 30 | And they buried him in the border of his possession
        in Thamnathsare, which is situate in mount Ephraim, on the north side of mount
        Gaas.
      v:031: JOS:24:31 | 31 | 31 | And Israel served the Lord all the days of Josue,
        and of the ancients that lived a long time after Josue, and that had known
        all the works of the Lord which he had done in Israel.
      v:032: JOS:24:32 | 32 | 32 | And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel
        had taken out of Egypt, they buried in Sichem, in that part of the field which
        Jacob had bought of the sons of Hemor the father of Sichem, for a hundred
        young ewes, and it was in the possession of the sons of Joseph.
      v:033: 'JOS:24:33 | 33 | 33 | Eleazar also the son of Aaron died: and they buried
        him in Gabaath that belongeth to Phinees his son, which was given him in mount
        Ephraim.'
intro: 'This Book is called JOSUE, because it contains the history of what passed
  under him, and according to the common opinion was written by him. The Greeks call
  him Jesus: for Josue and Jesus in the Hebrew, are the same name, and have the same
  signification, viz., A SAVIOUR. And it was not without a mystery that he who was
  to bring the people into the land of promise should have his name changed from OSEE
  (for so he was called before, Num. 13.17,) to JOSUE or JESUS, to give us to understand,
  that Moses by his law could only bring the people within sight of the promised inheritance,
  but that our Saviour JESUS was to bring us into it.'
