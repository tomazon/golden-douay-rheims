          note: 'That is to say, not only Jews, but Gentiles also, of what nation soever, are acceptable to God, if they fear him and work justice. But then true faith is always to be presupposed, without which (saith St. Paul, Heb. 11. 6) it is impossible to please God. Beware then of the error of those, who would infer from this passage, that men of all religions may be pleasing to God. For since none but the true religion can be from God, all other religions must be from the father of lies, and therefore highly displeasing to the God of truth.'

      v:002: 'ACT:19:2 | 2 | 2 | And he said to them: Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost.'
      v:003: "ACT:19:3 | 3 | 3 | And he said: In what then were you baptized? Who said: In John's baptism."
      v:004: 'ACT:19:4 | 4 | 4 | Then Paul said: John baptized the people with the baptism of penance saying: That they should believe in him, who was to come after him, that is to say, in Jesus.'

      v:009: 'ACT:19:9 | 9 | 9 | But when some were hardened and believed not, speaking evil of the way of the Lord before the multitude, departing from them, he separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.'
      v:010: 'ACT:19:10 | 10 | 10 | And this continued for the space of two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Gentiles.'
      v:011: ACT:19:11 | 11 | 11 | And God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common miracles.
      v:012: 'ACT:19:12 | 12 | 12 | So that even there were brought from his body to the sick, handkerchiefs and aprons: and the diseases departed from them: and the wicked spirits went out of them.{VS:P}'
      v:013: 'ACT:19:13 | 13 | 13 | Now some also of the Jewish exorcists, who went about, attempted to invoke over them that had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying: I conjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.'
      v:014: 'ACT:19:14 | 14 | 14 | And there were certain men, seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, that did this.'
      v:015: 'ACT:19:15 | 15 | 15 | But the wicked spirit, answering, said to them: Jesus I know: and Paul I know. But who are you?'
      v:016: 'ACT:19:16 | 16 | 16 | And the man in whom the wicked spirit was, leaping upon them and mastering them both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.'
      v:017: 'ACT:19:17 | 17 | 17 | And this became known to all the Jews and the Gentiles that dwelt a Ephesus. And fear fell on them all: and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.'
      v:018: 'ACT:19:18 | 18 | 18 | And many of them that believed came, confessing and declaring their deeds.'
      v:019: 'ACT:19:19 | 19 | 19 | And many of them who had followed curious arts brought together their books and burnt them before all. And, counting the price of them, they found the money to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.'
      v:020: 'ACT:19:20 | 20 | 20 | So mightily grew the word of God and was confirmed.{VS:P}'
      v:021: 'ACT:19:21 | 21 | 21 | And when these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying: After I have been there, I must see Rome also.'
      v:022: 'ACT:19:22 | 22 | 22 | And sending into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself remained for a time in Asia.'
      v:023: ACT:19:23 | 23 | 23 | Now at that time there arose no small disturbance about the way of the Lord.
      v:024: 'ACT:19:24 | 24 | 24 | For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver temples for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen.'
      v:025: 'ACT:19:25 | 25 | 25 | Whom he calling together with the workmen of like occupation, said: Sirs, you know that our gain is by this trade.'
      v:026: 'ACT:19:26 | 26 | 26 | And you see and hear that this Paul, by persuasion hath drawn away a great multitude, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying: they are not gods which are made by hands.'
      v:027: 'ACT:19:27 | 27 | 27 | So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought, but also the temple of great Diana shall be reputed for nothing! Yea, and her majesty shall begin to be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.'
      v:028: 'ACT:19:28 | 28 | 28 | Having heard these things, they were full of anger and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the Ephesians!'
      v:029: "ACT:19:29 | 29 | 29 | And the whole city was filled with confusion. And having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions, they rushed with one accord into the theatre."
      v:030: 'ACT:19:30 | 30 | 30 | And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.'
      v:031: 'ACT:19:31 | 31 | 31 | And some also of the rulers of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, desiring that he would not venture himself into the theatre.'
      v:032: 'ACT:19:32 | 32 | 32 | Now some cried one thing, some another. for the assembly was confused: and the greater part knew not for what cause they were come together.'
      v:033: 'ACT:19:33 | 33 | 33 | And they drew forth Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews thrusting him forward. And Alexander, beckoning with his hand for silence, would have given the people satisfaction,'
      v:034: 'ACT:19:34 | 34 | 34 | But as soon as they perceived him to be a Jew, all with one voice, for the space of about two, hours, cried out: Great is Diana of the Ephesians!'
      v:035: "ACT:19:35 | 35 | 35 | And when the town clerk had appeased the multitudes, he said: Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great Diana and of Jupiter's offspring?"
      v:036: 'ACT:19:36 | 36 | 36 | For as much therefore as these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.'
      v:037: 'ACT:19:37 | 37 | 37 | For you have brought hither these men, who are neither guilty of sacrilege nor of blasphemy against your goddess.'
      v:038: 'ACT:19:38 | 38 | 38 | But if Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a matter against any man, the courts of justice are open: and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse one another.'
      v:039: 'ACT:19:39 | 39 | 39 | And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be decided in a lawful assembly.'
      v:040: "ACT:19:40 | 40 | 40 | For we are even in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no man guilty (of whom we may give account) of this concourse. And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly."

      v:023: ACT:26:23 | 23 | 23 | That Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light to the people and to the Gentiles.
      v:024: 'ACT:26:24 | 24 | 24 | As he spoke these things and made his answer, Festus said with a loud voice: Paul, thou art beside thyself: much learning doth make thee mad.'
      v:025: 'ACT:26:25 | 25 | 25 | And Paul said: I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I speak words of truth and soberness.'
      v:026: 'ACT:26:26 | 26 | 26 | For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak with confidence. for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him. for neither was any of these things done in a corner.'

    intro: Paul is shipped for Rome. His voyage and shipwreck.
    verses:
      v:001: 'ACT:27:1 | 1 | 1 | And when it was determined that he should sail into Italy and that Paul, with the other prisoners, should be delivered to a centurion, named Julius, of the band Augusta,'
      v:002: 'ACT:27:2 | 2 | 2 | Going on board a ship of Adrumetum, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia, Aristarchus, the Macedonian of Thessalonica, continuing with us.'
      v:003: 'ACT:27:3 | 3 | 3 | And the day following, we came to Sidon. And Julius, treating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends and to take care of himself.'
      v:004: 'ACT:27:4 | 4 | 4 | And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.'
      v:005: 'ACT:27:5 | 5 | 5 | And sailing over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Lystra, which is in Lycia.'
      v:006: 'ACT:27:6 | 6 | 6 | And there, the centurion, finding a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, removed us into it.'
      v:007: 'ACT:27:7 | 7 | 7 | And when for many days we had sailed slowly and were scarce come over against Gnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed near Crete by Salmone.'
      v:008: 'ACT:27:8 | 8 | 8 | And with much ado sailing by it, we came into a certain place, which is called Good-havens, nigh to which was the city of Thalassa.'
      v:009: 'ACT:27:9 | 9 | 9 | And when much time was spent and when sailing now was dangerous, because the fast was now past, Paul comforted them,'
      v:010: 'ACT:27:10 | 10 | 10 | Saying to them: Ye men, I see that the voyage beginneth to be with injury and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.'
      v:011: 'ACT:27:11 | 11 | 11 | But the centurion believed the pilot and the master of the ship, more than those things which were said by Paul.'
      v:012: 'ACT:27:12 | 12 | 12 | And whereas it was not a commodious haven to winter in, the greatest part gave counsel to sail thence, if by any means they might reach Phenice, to winter there, which is a haven of Crete, looking towards the south-west and north-west.'
      v:013: 'ACT:27:13 | 13 | 13 | And the south wind gently blowing, thinking that they had obtained their purpose, when they had loosed from Asson, they sailed close by Crete.{VS:P}'
      v:014: 'ACT:27:14 | 14 | 14 | But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroaquilo.'
      v:015: 'ACT:27:15 | 15 | 15 | And when the ship was caught and could not bear up against the wind, giving up the ship to the winds, we were driven.'
      v:016: 'ACT:27:16 | 16 | 16 | And running under a certain island that is called Cauda, we had much work to come by the boat.'
      v:017: 'ACT:27:17 | 17 | 17 | Which being taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship: and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, they let down the sail yard and so were driven.'
      v:018: 'ACT:27:18 | 18 | 18 | And we, being mightily tossed with the tempest, the next day they lightened the ship.'
      v:019: ACT:27:19 | 19 | 19 | And the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.
      v:020: 'ACT:27:20 | 20 | 20 | And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and no small storm lay on us, all hope of our being saved was now taken away.'
      v:021: 'ACT:27:21 | 21 | 21 | And after they had fasted a long time, Paul standing forth in the midst of them, said: You should indeed, O ye men, have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from Crete and have gained this harm and loss.'
      v:022: "ACT:27:22 | 22 | 22 | And now I exhort you to be of good cheer. for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but only of the ship."
      v:023: 'ACT:27:23 | 23 | 23 | For an angel of God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood by me this night,'
      v:024: 'ACT:27:24 | 24 | 24 | Saying: Fear not, Paul, thou must be brought before Caesar; and behold, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.'
      v:025: 'ACT:27:25 | 25 | 25 | Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall so be, as it hath been told me.'
      v:026: ACT:27:26 | 26 | 26 | And we must come unto a certain island.
      v:027: 'ACT:27:27 | 27 | 27 | But after the fourteenth night was come, as we were sailing in Adria, about midnight, the shipmen deemed that they discovered some country.'
      v:028: 'ACT:27:28 | 28 | 28 | Who also sounding, found twenty fathoms: and going on a little further, they found fifteen fathoms.'
      v:029: 'ACT:27:29 | 29 | 29 | Then fearing lest we should fall upon rough places, they cast four anchors out of the stern: and wished for the day.'
      v:030: 'ACT:27:30 | 30 | 30 | But as the shipmen sought to fly out of the ship, having let down the boat into the sea, under colour, as though they would have cast anchors out of the forepart of the ship,'
      v:031: 'ACT:27:31 | 31 | 31 | Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers: Except these stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.'
      v:032: ACT:27:32 | 32 | 32 | Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off.
      v:033: 'ACT:27:33 | 33 | 33 | And when it began to be light, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying: This day is the fourteenth day that you have waited and continued fasting, taking nothing.'
      v:034: "ACT:27:34 | 34 | 34 | Wherefore, I pray you to take some meat for your health's sake: for there shall not an hair of the head of any of you perish."
      v:035: 'ACT:27:35 | 35 | 35 | And when he had said these things, taking bread, he gave thanks to God in the sight of them all. And when he had broken it, he began to eat.'
      v:036: 'ACT:27:36 | 36 | 36 | Then were they all of better cheer: and they also took some meat.'
      v:037: ACT:27:37 | 37 | 37 | And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
      v:038: 'ACT:27:38 | 38 | 38 | And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting the wheat into the sea.'
      v:039: 'ACT:27:39 | 39 | 39 | And when it was day, they knew not the land. But they discovered a certain creek that had a shore, into which they minded, if they could, to thrust in the ship.'
      v:040: 'ACT:27:40 | 40 | 40 | And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, loosing withal the rudder bands. And hoisting up the mainsail to the wind, they made towards shore.'
      v:041: 'ACT:27:41 | 41 | 41 | And when we were fallen into a place where two seas met, they run the ship aground. And the forepart indeed, sticking fast, remained unmoveable: but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the sea.'
      v:042: "ACT:27:42 | 42 | 42 | And the soldiers' counsel was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any of them, swimming out should escape."
      v:043: 'ACT:27:43 | 43 | 43 | But the centurion, willing to save Paul, forbade it to be done. And he commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and save themselves and get to land.'
      v:044: 'ACT:27:44 | 44 | 44 | And the rest, some they carried on boards and some on those things that belonged to the ship. And so it came to pass that every soul got safe to land.'

    intro: 'Paul, after three months’ stay in Melita, continues his voyage and arrives at Rome. His conference there with the Jews.'
    verses:
      v:001: 'ACT:28:1 | 1 | 1 | And when we had escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita. But the barbarians shewed us no small courtesy.'
      v:002: 'ACT:28:2 | 2 | 2 | For kindling a fire, they refreshed us all, because of the present rain and of the cold.'
      v:003: 'ACT:28:3 | 3 | 3 | And when Paul had gathered together a bundle of sticks and had laid them on the fire, a viper, coming out of the heat, fastened on his hand.'
      v:004: 'ACT:28:4 | 4 | 4 | And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging on his hand, they said one to another: Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, who, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance doth not suffer him to live.'
      v:005: 'ACT:28:5 | 5 | 5 | And he indeed, shaking off the beast into the fire, suffered no harm.'
      v:006: 'ACT:28:6 | 6 | 6 | But they supposed that he would begin to swell up and that he would suddenly fall down and die. But expecting long and seeing that there came no harm to him, changing their minds, they said that he was a god.'
      v:007: 'ACT:28:7 | 7 | 7 | Now in these places were possessions of the chief man of the island, named Publius: who, receiving us for three days, entertained us courteously.'
      v:008: 'ACT:28:8 | 8 | 8 | And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux. To whom Paul entered in. And when he had prayed and laid his hands on him, he healed him.'
      v:009: 'ACT:28:9 | 9 | 9 | Which being done, all that had diseases in the island came and were healed.'
      v:010: 'ACT:28:10 | 10 | 10 | Who also honoured us with many honours: and when we were to set sail, they laded us with such things as were necessary.{VS:P}'

      v:013: 'ACT:28:13 | 13 | 13 | From thence, compassing by the shore, we came to Rhegium: and after one day, the south wind blowing, we came the second day to Puteoli:'

      v:015: 'ACT:28:15 | 15 | 15 | And from thence, when the brethren had heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and the Three Taverns. Whom when Paul saw, he gave thanks to God and took courage.'

And when they were assembled, he said to them: Men, brethren, I, having done nothing against the people or the custom of our fathers, was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.'
      v:018: 'ACT:28:18 | 18 | 18 | Who, when they had examined me, would have released me, for that there was no cause of death in me.'
      v:019: 'ACT:28:19 | 19 | 19 | But the Jews contradicting it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar: not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.'
      v:020: 'ACT:28:20 | 20 | 20 | For this cause therefore I desired to see you and to speak to you. Because that for the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.'

      v:023: 'ACT:28:23 | 23 | 23 | And when they had appointed him a day, there came very many to him unto his lodgings. To whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God and persuading them concerning Jesus, out of the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning until evening.'
      v:024: 'ACT:28:24 | 24 | 24 | And some believed the things that were said: but some believed not.'
      v:025: 'ACT:28:25 | 25 | 25 | And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, Paul speaking this one word: Well did the Holy Ghost speak to our fathers by Isaias the prophet,'

intro: 'This Book, which, from the first ages, hath been called, THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES, is not to be considered as a history of what was done by all the Apostles, who were dispersed into different nations; but only a short view of the first establishment of the Christian Church. A part of the preaching and action of St. Peter are related in the first twelve chapters; and a particular account of St. Paul’s apostolical labours in the subsequent chapters. It was written by St. Luke the Evangelist, and the original in Greek. Its history commences from the Ascension of Christ our Lord and ends in the year sixty-three, being a brief account of the Church for the space of about thirty years.'
