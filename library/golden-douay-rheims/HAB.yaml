  c:001:
    intro: 'The prophet complains of the wickedness of the people: God reveals to
      him the vengeance he is going to take of them by the Chaldeans.'
    verses:
      v:001: HAB:1:1 | 1 | 1 | The burden that Habacuc the prophet saw.
      v:002: HAB:1:2 | 2 | 2 | How long, O Lord, shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear?
        shall I cry out to thee suffering violence, and thou wilt not save?
      v:003: HAB:1:3 | 3 | 3 | Why hast thou shewn me iniquity and grievance, to see
        rapine and injustice before me? and there is a judgment, but opposition is
        more powerful.
      v:004: 'HAB:1:4 | 4 | 4 | Therefore the law is torn in pieces, and judgment
        cometh not to the end: because the wicked prevaileth against the just, therefore
        wrong judgment goeth forth.'
      v:005: 'HAB:1:5 | 5 | 5 | Behold ye among the nations, and see: wonder, and
        be astonished: for a work is done in your days, which no man will believe
        when it shall be told.'
      v:006: HAB:1:6 | 6 | 6 | For behold, I will raise up the Chaldeans, a bitter
        and swift nation, marching upon the breadth of the earth, to possess the dwelling
        places that are not their own.
      v:007: 'HAB:1:7 | 7 | 7 | They are dreadful, and terrible: from themselves shall
        their judgment, and their burden proceed.'
      v:008: 'HAB:1:8 | 8 | 8 | Their horses are lighter than leopards, and swifter
        than evening wolves; and their horsemen shall be spread abroad: for their
        horsemen shall come from afar, they shall fly as an eagle that maketh haste
        to eat.'
      v:009: 'HAB:1:9 | 9 | 9 | They shall all come to the prey, their face is like
        a burning wind: and they shall gather together captives as the sand.'
      v:010: 'HAB:1:10 | 10 | 10 | And their prince shall triumph over kings, and
        princes shall be his laughingstock: and he shall laugh at every strong hold,
        and shall cast up a mount, and shall take it.'
      v:011: 'HAB:1:11 | 11 | 11 | Then shall his spirit be changed, and he shall
        pass, and fall: this is his strength of his god.'
      v:012: 'HAB:1:12 | 12 | 12 | Wast thou not from the beginning, O Lord my God,
        my holy one, and we shall not die? Lord, thou hast appointed him for judgment:
        and made him strong for correction.'
      v:013: HAB:1:13 | 13 | 13 | Thy eyes are too pure to behold evil, and thou canst
        not look on iniquity. Why lookest thou upon them that do unjust things, and
        holdest thy peace when the wicked devoureth the man that is more just than
        himself?
      v:014: HAB:1:14 | 14 | 14 | And thou wilt make men as the fishes of the sea,
        and as the creeping things that have no ruler.
      v:015: 'HAB:1:15 | 15 | 15 | He lifted up all them with his hook, he drew them
        in his drag, and gathered them into his net: for this he will be glad and
        rejoice.'
      v:016: 'HAB:1:16 | 16 | 16 | Therefore will he offer victims to his drag, and
        he will sacrifice to his net: because through them his portion is made fat,
        and his meat dainty.'
      v:017: HAB:1:17 | 17 | 17 | For this cause therefore he spreadeth his net, and
        will not spare continually to slay the nations.
  c:002:
    intro: The prophet is admonished to wait with faith. The enemies of Godâ€™s people
      shall assuredly be punished.
    verses:
      v:001: 'HAB:2:1 | 1 | 1 | I will stand upon my watch, and fix my foot upon the
        tower: and I will watch, to see what will be said to me, and what I may answer
        to him that reproveth me.'
      v:002: 'HAB:2:2 | 2 | 2 | And the Lord answered me, and said: Write the vision,
        and make it plain upon tables: that he that readeth it may run over it.'
      v:003: 'HAB:2:3 | 3 | 3 | For as yet the vision is far off, and it shall appear
        at the end, and shall not lie: if it make any delay, wait for it: for it shall
        surely come, and it shall not be slack.'
      v:004: 'HAB:2:4 | 4 | 4 | Behold, he that is unbelieving, his soul shall not
        be right in himself: but the just shall live in his faith.'
      v:005: 'HAB:2:5 | 5 | 5 | And as wine deceiveth him that drinketh it: so shall
        the proud man be, and he shall not be honoured: who hath enlarged his desire
        like hell: and is himself like death, and he is never satisfied: but will
        gather together unto him all nations, and heap together unto him all people.'
      v:006: 'HAB:2:6 | 6 | 6 | Shall not all these take up a parable against him,
        and a dark speech concerning him: and it shall be said: Woe to him that heapeth
        together that which is not his own? how long also doth he load himself with
        thick clay?'
      v:007: 'HAB:2:7 | 7 | 7 | Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee:
        and they be stirred up that shall tear thee, and thou shalt be a spoil to
        them?'
      v:008: 'HAB:2:8 | 8 | 8 | Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all that shall
        be left of the people shall spoil thee: because of men''s blood, and for the
        iniquity of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.'
      v:009: HAB:2:9 | 9 | 9 | Woe to him that gathereth together an evil covetousness
        to his house, that his nest may be on high, and thinketh he may be delivered
        out of the hand of evil.
      v:010: HAB:2:10 | 10 | 10 | Thou hast devised confusion to thy house, thou hast
        cut off many people, and thy soul hath sinned.
      v:011: 'HAB:2:11 | 11 | 11 | For the stone shall cry out of the wall: and the
        timber that is between the joints of the building, shall answer.'
      v:012: HAB:2:12 | 12 | 12 | Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and
        prepareth a city by iniquity.
      v:013: 'HAB:2:13 | 13 | 13 | Are not these things from the Lord of hosts? for
        the people shall labour in a great fire: and the nations in vain, and they
        shall faint.'
      v:014: HAB:2:14 | 14 | 14 | For the earth shall be filled, that men may know
        the glory of the Lord, as waters covering the sea.
      v:015: HAB:2:15 | 15 | 15 | Woe to him that giveth drink to his friend, and
        presenteth his gall, and maketh him drunk, that he may behold his nakedness.
      v:016: 'HAB:2:16 | 16 | 16 | Thou art filled with shame instead of glory: drink
        thou also, and fall fast asleep: the cup of the right hand of the Lord shall
        compass thee, and shameful vomiting shall be on thy glory.'
      v:017: HAB:2:17 | 17 | 17 | For the iniquity of Libanus shall cover thee, and
        the ravaging of beasts shall terrify them because of the blood of men, and
        the iniquity of the land, and of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
      v:018: HAB:2:18 | 18 | 18 | What doth the graven thing avail, because the maker
        thereof hath graven it, a molten, and a false image? because the forger thereof
        hath trusted in a thing of his own forging, to make dumb idols.
      v:019: 'HAB:2:19 | 19 | 19 | Woe to him that saith to wood: Awake: to the dumb
        stone: Arise: can it teach? Behold, it is laid over with gold, and silver,
        and there is no spirit in the bowels thereof.'
      v:020: 'HAB:2:20 | 20 | 20 | But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the
        earth keep silence before him.'

        of the years thou shalt make it known: when thou art angry, thou wilt remember
        mercy.'
      v:003: 'HAB:3:3 | 3 | 3 | God will come from the south, and the holy one from
        mount Pharan: His glory covered the heavens, and the earth is full of his
        praise.'
      v:004: 'HAB:3:4 | 4 | 4 | His brightness shall be as the light: horns are in
        his hands: There is his strength hid:'

        horses: and thy chariots are salvation.'
      v:009: 'HAB:3:9 | 9 | 9 | Thou wilt surely take up thy bow: according to the

      v:014: HAB:3:14 | 14 | 14 | Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors,

        that are girded.'
      v:017: 'HAB:3:17 | 17 | 17 | For the fig tree shall not blossom: and there shall
        be no spring in the vines. The labour of the olive tree shall fail: and the

intro: HABACUC was a native of Bezocher, and prophesied in JUDA, some time before
  the invasion of the CHALDEANS, which he foretold. He lived to see this prophecy
  fulfilled, and for many years after, according to the general opinion, which supposes
  him to be the same that was brought by the ANGEL to DANIEL in BABYLON, Dan. 14.
