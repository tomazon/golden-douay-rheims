      v:003: 'PRO:1:3 | 3 | 3 | To understand the words of prudence: and to receive

      v:005: 'PRO:1:5 | 5 | 5 | A wise man shall hear, and shall be wiser: and he

        the words of the wise, and their mysterious sayings.
      v:007: PRO:1:7 | 7 | 7 | The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools
        despise wisdom and instruction.
      v:008: 'PRO:1:8 | 8 | 8 | My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake
        not the law of thy mother:'
      v:009: PRO:1:9 | 9 | 9 | That grace may be added to thy head, and a chain of
        gold to thy neck.
      v:010: PRO:1:10 | 10 | 10 | My son, if sinners shall entice thee, consent not
        to them.
      v:011: 'PRO:1:11 | 11 | 11 | If they shall say: Come with us, let us lie in
        wait for blood, let us hide snares for the innocent without cause:'

        as one that goeth down into the pit.
      v:013: PRO:1:13 | 13 | 13 | We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill
        our houses with spoils.
      v:014: PRO:1:14 | 14 | 14 | Cast in thy lot with us, let us all have one purse.
      v:015: PRO:1:15 | 15 | 15 | My son, walk not thou with them, restrain thy foot
        from their paths.
      v:016: PRO:1:16 | 16 | 16 | For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed
        blood.
      v:017: PRO:1:17 | 17 | 17 | But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them
        that have wings.
      v:018: PRO:1:18 | 18 | 18 | And they themselves lie in wait for their own blood,
        and practise deceits against their own souls.
      v:019: PRO:1:19 | 19 | 19 | So the ways of every covetous man destroy the souls
        of the possessors.
      v:020: 'PRO:1:20 | 20 | 20 | Wisdom preacheth abroad, she uttereth her voice
        in the streets:'
      v:021: 'PRO:1:21 | 21 | 21 | At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the
        entrance of the gates of the city she uttereth her words, saying:'
      v:022: PRO:1:22 | 22 | 22 | O children, how long will you love childishness,
        and fools covet those things which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise
        hate knowledge?
      v:023: 'PRO:1:23 | 23 | 23 | Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will utter my spirit
        to you, and will shew you my words.'
      v:024: 'PRO:1:24 | 24 | 24 | Because I called, and you refused: I stretched
        out my hand, and there was none that regarded.'
      v:025: PRO:1:25 | 25 | 25 | You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected
        my reprehensions.
      v:026: PRO:1:26 | 26 | 26 | I also will laugh in your destruction, and will
        mock when that shall come to you which you feared.
      v:027: 'PRO:1:27 | 27 | 27 | When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction,
        as a tempest, shall be at hand: when tribulation and distress shall come upon
        you:'
      v:028: 'PRO:1:28 | 28 | 28 | Then shall they call upon me, and I will not hear:
        they shall rise in the morning, and shall not find me:'
      v:029: PRO:1:29 | 29 | 29 | Because they have hated instruction, and received
        not the fear of the Lord,
      v:030: PRO:1:30 | 30 | 30 | Nor consented to my counsel, but despised all my
        reproof.
      v:031: PRO:1:31 | 31 | 31 | Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own
        way, and shall be filled with their own devices.
      v:032: PRO:1:32 | 32 | 32 | The turning away of little ones shall kill them,
        and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
      v:033: PRO:1:33 | 33 | 33 | But he that shall hear me, shall rest without terror,
        and shall enjoy abundance, without fear of evils.

        and learn wisdom:'
      v:007: PRO:6:7 | 7 | 7 | Which, although she hath no guide, nor master, nor
        captain,
      v:008: PRO:6:8 | 8 | 8 | Provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth
        her food in the harvest.

      v:017: PRO:6:17 | 17 | 17 | Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent
        blood,
      v:018: PRO:6:18 | 18 | 18 | A heart that deviseth wicked plots, feet that are
        swift to run into mischief,
      v:019: PRO:6:19 | 19 | 19 | A deceitful witness that uttereth lies, and him

        thou sleepest, let them keep thee, and when thou awakest, talk with them.'
      v:023: 'PRO:6:23 | 23 | 23 | Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law
        a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:'

        fountains of waters:'
      v:029: 'PRO:8:29 | 29 | 29 | When he compassed the sea with its bounds, and
        set a law to the waters that they should not pass their limits: when he balanced
        the foundations of the earth;'
      v:030: 'PRO:8:30 | 30 | 30 | I was with him forming all things: and was delighted
        every day, playing before him at all times;'
