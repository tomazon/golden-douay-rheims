book_intro: 'These Books are called by the Greek interpreters, Paralipomenon, that is, of things left out, or omitted; because they are a kind of a supplement of such things as were passed over in the books of the Kings. The Hebrews call them Dibre Haijamim, that is, The words of the days, or The Chronicles.â€”Not that they are the books which are so often quoted in the Kings, under the title of the words of the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Juda: for the books of Paralipomenon were written after the books of Kings: but because in all probability they have been abridged from those ancient words of the days, by Esdras or some other sacred writer.'

      v:003: '1CH:21:3 | 3 | 3 | And Joab answered: The Lord make his people a hundred times more than they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all thy servants: why doth my lord seek this thing, which may be imputed as a sin to Israel?'
      v:004: "1CH:21:4 | 4 | 4 | But the king's word rather prevailed: and Joab departed, and went through all Israel: and returned to Jerusalem."
      v:005: '1CH:21:5 | 5 | 5 | And he gave David the number of them, whom he had surveyed: and all the number of Israel was found to be eleven hundred thousand men that drew the sword: and of Juda four hundred and seventy thousand fighting men.'

      v:008: '1CH:21:8 | 8 | 8 | And David said to God: I have sinned exceedingly in doing this: I beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done foolishly.'
      v:009: '1CH:21:9 | 9 | 9 | And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer of David, saying:'

      v:013: '1CH:21:13 | 13 | 13 | And David said to Gad: I am on every side in a great strait: but it is better for me to fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of men.'

And the angel of the Lord stood by the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.'
      v:016: '1CH:21:16 | 16 | 16 | And David lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against Jerusalem: and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the ground.'

It is I that have sinned: it is I that have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O Lord my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father's house: and let not thy people be destroyed."

      v:022: '1CH:21:22 | 22 | 22 | And David said to him: Give me this place of thy thrashingfloor, that I may build therein an altar to the Lord: but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people.'
      v:023: '1CH:21:23 | 23 | 23 | And Ornan said to David: Take it, and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen also I give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the sacrifice: I will give it all willingly.'
      v:024: '1CH:21:24 | 24 | 24 | And king David said to him: It shall not be so, but I will give thee money as much as it is worth: for I must not take it from thee, and so offer to the Lord holocausts free cost.'
      v:025: '1CH:21:25 | 25 | 25 | So David gave to Ornan for the place, six hundred sicles of gold of just weight.'
      v:026: '1CH:21:26 | 26 | 26 | And he built there an altar to the Lord: and he offered holocausts, and peace offerings, and he called upon the Lord, and he heard him by sending fire from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust.'
      v:027: '1CH:21:27 | 27 | 27 | And the Lord commanded the angel: and he put up his sword again into the sheath.'
      v:028: '1CH:21:28 | 28 | 28 | And David seeing that the Lord had heard him in the thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims there.'
