      v:019: '2ES:4:19 | 19 | 19 | And I answered, and sayd: Verely they deuised a vayne deuise. for the earth is geuen to the wood, and a place to the sea to carie her waues.'
      v:020: '2ES:4:20 | 20 | 20 | And he answered me, and sayed: Thou hast iudged wel, and why hast thou not iudged for thy self?'

      v:026: '2ES:4:26 | 26 | 26 | And he answered me, and sayd: If thou search very much, thou shalt often meruail: because the world hastening hasteneth to passe,'
      v:027: '2ES:4:27 | 27 | 27 | and can not comprehend the thinges which in times to come are promised to the iust: because this world is ful of iniustice and infirmities.'
      v:028: '2ES:4:28 | 28 | 28 | But conerning the thinges that thou demandest I wil tel thee: for the euil is sowed, and the destruction therof is not yet come.'
      v:029: '2ES:4:29 | 29 | 29 | If then that which is sowen be not turned vp, and the place depart where the euil is sowen, that shal not come where the good is sowen.'
      v:030: '2ES:4:30 | 30 | 30 | Because the grayne of il seede hath bene sowen in the hart of Adam from the beginning: and how much impietie hath it ingendered vntil now, and doth ingender vntil the floore come?'

      v:033: '2ES:4:33 | 33 | 33 | And I answered, and sayd: How, and when shal these things be? why are our yeares few and euil?'
      v:034: '2ES:4:34 | 34 | 34 | And he answered me, and sayd to me, Hasten not aboue the Highest. for thou doest hasten in vaine to be aboue him, for thy excesse is much.'
      v:035: '2ES:4:35 | 35 | 35 | Did not the soules of the iust in the cellars, aske of these things, saying: How hope I so, and when shal the fruite come of the floore of our reward?'
      v:036: '2ES:4:36 | 36 | 36 | And Ieremiel the Archangel answered to those things, and sayd: When the number of the sedes in you shal be filled, because he hath weyed the world in a balance,'
      v:037: '2ES:4:37 | 37 | 37 | and with a measure hath he measured the times, and in number he hath numbered the times, and hath not moued, nor stirred them, vntil the foresayd measure be filled.'
      v:038: '2ES:4:38 | 38 | 38 | And I answered, and sayd: O Lord Dominatour, we also are al ful of impietie.'

      v:040: '2ES:4:40 | 40 | 40 | And he answered me, and sayd: Goe, and aske a woman with childe, if when she hath accomplished her nine monethes, her wombe can yet hold the infant within it?'
      v:041: '2ES:4:41 | 41 | 41 | And I sayd it can not Lord. And he sayd to me, in hel the cellars of the soules are like to the matrice.'
      v:042: '2ES:4:42 | 42 | 42 | For as she that is: In trauail maketh hast, to escape the necessitie of trauailing: so this also hasteneth to render those thinges which are commended to it.'
      v:043: '2ES:4:43 | 43 | 43 | From the beginning it shal be shewed thee touching those thinges, which thou doest couet to see.'
      v:044: '2ES:4:44 | 44 | 44 | And I answered, and sayd: If I haue found grace before thine eyes, & if it be possible, and if I by fitte,'

      v:047: '2ES:4:47 | 47 | 47 | And he sayd to me: Stand vpon the right side, and I wil shew thee the interpretation of the similitude.'
      v:048: '2ES:4:48 | 48 | 48 | And I stood, and saw: and behold a burning fornace passed before me, & it came to passe when the flame passed, I saw: and behold the smoke ouercame.'
      v:049: '2ES:4:49 | 49 | 49 | And these thinges there passed before me a clowd ful of water, and with violence casting in much raine: and when the violence of raine was cast, the droppes therin ouercame.'
      v:050: '2ES:4:50 | 50 | 50 | And he sayd to me: Thinke with thyself, as the raine increaseth more then the droppes, and the fire then the smoke: so did the measure that passed, more a bound. But the droppes, and the smoke ouercame:'
      v:051: '2ES:4:51 | 51 | 51 | and I prayed, & sayd, shal I liue thinkest thou vntil these dayes? or what shal be in those dayes?'
      v:052: '2ES:4:52 | 52 | 52 | He answered me, and sayd: Of the signes wherof thou askest me, in part I can tel thee, howbeit of thy life I was not sent to tel thee, neither doe I know.'
