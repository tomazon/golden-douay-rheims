book_intro: "St. Paul wrote this epistle at Corinth, when he was preparing to go to Jerusalem with the charitable contributions collected in Achaia and Macedonia for the relief of the Christians in Judea; which was about twenty-four years after Our Lord's Ascension. It was written in Greek; but at the same time translated into Latin, for the benefit of those who did not understand that language. And though it is not the first of his Epistles in the order of time, yet it is first placed on account of sublimity of the matter contained in it, of the preeminence of the place to which it was sent, and in veneration of the Church."

    verses:
      v:001: 'ROM:13:1 | 1 | 1 | Let every soul be subject to higher powers. for there is no power but from God: and those that are, are ordained of God.'
      v:002: 'ROM:13:2 | 2 | 2 | Therefore, he that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist purchase to themselves damnation.'
      v:003: 'ROM:13:3 | 3 | 3 | For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.'
      v:004: "ROM:13:4 | 4 | 4 | For he is God's minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. for he is God's minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil."
      v:005: "ROM:13:5 | 5 | 5 | Wherefore be subject of necessity: not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake."
      v:006: 'ROM:13:6 | 6 | 6 | For therefore also you pay tribute. for they are the ministers of God, serving unto this purpose.'
      v:007: 'ROM:13:7 | 7 | 7 | Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour, to whom honour.'
      v:008: 'ROM:13:8 | 8 | 8 | Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. for he that loveth his neighbour hath fulfilled the law.'
      v:009: 'ROM:13:9 | 9 | 9 | For: Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not covet. And if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'
      v:010: ROM:13:10 | 10 | 10 | The love of our neighbour worketh no evil. Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law.
      v:011: 'ROM:13:11 | 11 | 11 | And that, knowing the season, that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. for now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.'

        - note: "Viz., without observing the distinction of clean and unclean meats, prescribed by the law of Moses: which was now no longer obligatory. Some weak Christians, converted from among the Jews, as we here gather from the apostle, made a scruple of eating such meats as were deemed unclean by the law; such as swine's flesh, etc., which the stronger sort of Christians did eat without scruple. Now the apostle, to reconcile them together, exhorts the former not to judge or condemn the latter, using their Christian liberty; and the latter, to take care not to despise or scandalize their weaker brethren, either by bringing them to eat what in their conscience they think they should not, or by giving them such offence, as to endanger the driving them thereby from the Christian religion."

    verses:
      v:001: 'ROM:14:1 | 1 | 1 | Now him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.'
      v:002: 'ROM:14:2 | 2 | 2 | For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs.'
      v:003: 'ROM:14:3 | 3 | 3 | Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. for God hath taken him to him.'
      v:004: "ROM:14:4 | 4 | 4 | Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand."
      v:005: 'ROM:14:5 | 5 | 5 | For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day. Let every man abound in his own sense.'
      v:006: 'ROM:14:6 | 6 | 6 | He that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not and giveth thanks to God.'
      v:007: 'ROM:14:7 | 7 | 7 | For none of us liveth to himself: and no man dieth to himself.'
      v:008: "ROM:14:8 | 8 | 8 | For whether we live, we live unto the Lord: or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's."
      v:009: 'ROM:14:9 | 9 | 9 | For to this end Christ died and rose again: that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.'
      v:010: 'ROM:14:10 | 10 | 10 | But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? Or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.'
      v:011: 'ROM:14:11 | 11 | 11 | For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God.'
      v:012: ROM:14:12 | 12 | 12 | Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.
      v:013: "ROM:14:13 | 13 | 13 | Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother's way."
      v:014: 'ROM:14:14 | 14 | 14 | I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.'
      v:015: 'ROM:14:15 | 15 | 15 | For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.'
      v:016: ROM:14:16 | 16 | 16 | Let not then our good be evil spoken of.
      v:017: 'ROM:14:17 | 17 | 17 | For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink: but justice and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.'
      v:018: ROM:14:18 | 18 | 18 | For he that in this serveth Christ pleaseth God and is approved of men.
      v:019: 'ROM:14:19 | 19 | 19 | Therefore, let us follow after the things that are of peace and keep the things that are of edification, one towards another.'
      v:020: 'ROM:14:20 | 20 | 20 | Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.'
      v:021: 'ROM:14:21 | 21 | 21 | It is good not to eat flesh and not to drink wine: nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended or scandalized or made weak.'
      v:022: 'ROM:14:22 | 22 | 22 | Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.'
      v:023: 'ROM:14:23 | 23 | 23 | But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of faith. for all that is not of faith is sin.'

    intro: He exhorts them to be all of one mind and promises to come and see them.
    verses:
      v:001: 'ROM:15:1 | 1 | 1 | Now, we that are stronger ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves.'
      v:002: 'ROM:15:2 | 2 | 2 | Let every one of you please his neighbour unto good, to edification.'

      v:009: 'ROM:15:9 | 9 | 9 | But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles and will sing to thy name.'

      v:014: 'ROM:15:14 | 14 | 14 | And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you that you also are full of love, replenished with all knowledge, so that you are able to admonish one another.'
      v:015: 'ROM:15:15 | 15 | 15 | But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were putting you in mind, because of the grace which is given me from God,'
      v:016: 'ROM:15:16 | 16 | 16 | That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles: sanctifying the gospel of God, that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy Ghost.'
      v:017: ROM:15:17 | 17 | 17 | I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards God.
      v:018: 'ROM:15:18 | 18 | 18 | For I dare not to speak of any of those things which Christ worketh not by me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,'
      v:019: 'ROM:15:19 | 19 | 19 | By the virtue of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost, so that from Jerusalem round about, as far as unto Illyricum, I have replenished the gospel of Christ.'
      v:020: "ROM:15:20 | 20 | 20 | And I have so preached this gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation."
      v:021: 'ROM:15:21 | 21 | 21 | But as it is written: They to whom he was not spoken of shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.'
      v:022: 'ROM:15:22 | 22 | 22 | For which cause also, I was hindered very much from coming to you and have been kept away till now.'
      v:023: 'ROM:15:23 | 23 | 23 | But now, having no more place in these countries and having a great desire these many years past to come unto you,'
      v:024: 'ROM:15:24 | 24 | 24 | When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain, I hope that, as I pass, I shall see you and be brought on my way thither by you: if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you.'

      v:026: ROM:15:26 | 26 | 26 | For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.
      v:027: 'ROM:15:27 | 27 | 27 | For it hath pleased them: and they are their debtors. For, if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.'
      v:028: 'ROM:15:28 | 28 | 28 | When therefore I shall have accomplished this and consigned to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.'
      v:029: ROM:15:29 | 29 | 29 | And I know that when I come to you I shall come in the abundance of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.
