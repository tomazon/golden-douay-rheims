    verses:
      v:001: 'LUK:5:1 | 1 | 1 | And it came to pass, that when the multitudes pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Genesareth,'
      v:002: 'LUK:5:2 | 2 | 2 | And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets.'
      v:003: "LUK:5:3 | 3 | 3 | And going into one of the ships that was Simon's, he desired him to draw back a little from the land. And sitting, he taught the multitudes out of the ship."
      v:004: 'LUK:5:4 | 4 | 4 | Now when he had ceased to speak, he said to Simon: Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught.'
      v:005: 'LUK:5:5 | 5 | 5 | And Simon answering said to him: Master, we have laboured all the night and have taken nothing: but at thy word I will let down the net.'
      v:006: 'LUK:5:6 | 6 | 6 | And when they had done this, they enclosed a very great multitude of fishes: and their net broke.'
      v:007: 'LUK:5:7 | 7 | 7 | And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came and filled both the ships, so that they were almost sinking.'
      v:008: "LUK:5:8 | 8 | 8 | Which when Simon Peter saw, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying: Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord."
      v:009: 'LUK:5:9 | 9 | 9 | For he was wholly astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken.'
      v:010: "LUK:5:10 | 10 | 10 | And so were also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's partners. And Jesus saith to Simon: Fear not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men."
      v:011: 'LUK:5:11 | 11 | 11 | And having brought their ships to land, leaving all things, they followed him.'
      v:012: 'LUK:5:12 | 12 | 12 | And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy who, seeing Jesus and falling on his face, besought him saying: Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.'
      v:013: 'LUK:5:13 | 13 | 13 | And stretching forth his hand, he touched him, saying: I will. Be thou cleansed. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.'
      v:014: 'LUK:5:14 | 14 | 14 | And he charged him that he should tell no man, but: Go, shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.'
      v:015: 'LUK:5:15 | 15 | 15 | But the fame of him went abroad the more: and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.'
      v:016: LUK:5:16 | 16 | 16 | And he retired into the desert; and prayed.
      v:017: 'LUK:5:17 | 17 | 17 | And it came to pass on a certain day, as he sat teaching, that there were also Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, that were come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was to heal them.'
      v:018: 'LUK:5:18 | 18 | 18 | And behold, men brought in a bed a man who had the palsy: and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him.'
      v:019: 'LUK:5:19 | 19 | 19 | And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went up upon the roof and let him down through the tiles with his bed into the midst before Jesus.'
      v:020: 'LUK:5:20 | 20 | 20 | Whose faith when he saw, he said: Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.'
      v:021: 'LUK:5:21 | 21 | 21 | And the scribes and Pharisees began to think, saying: Who is this who speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?'
      v:022: 'LUK:5:22 | 22 | 22 | And when Jesus knew their thoughts, answering he said to them: What is it you think in your hearts?'
      v:023: 'LUK:5:23 | 23 | 23 | Which is easier to say: Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say: Arise and walk?'
      v:024: 'LUK:5:24 | 24 | 24 | But that you may know that the Son of man hath the power on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy), I say to thee, Arise, take up thy bed and go into thy house.'
      v:025: 'LUK:5:25 | 25 | 25 | And immediately rising up before them, he took up the bed on which he lay: and he went away to his own house, glorifying God.'
      v:026: 'LUK:5:26 | 26 | 26 | And all were astonished: and they glorified God. And they were filled with fear, saying: We have seen wonderful things to-day.'
      v:027: 'LUK:5:27 | 27 | 27 | And after these things, he went forth and saw a publican named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him: Follow me.'
      v:028: 'LUK:5:28 | 28 | 28 | And leaving all things, he rose up and followed him.'
      v:029: 'LUK:5:29 | 29 | 29 | And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: And there was a great company of publicans and of others that were at table with them.'
      v:030: 'LUK:5:30 | 30 | 30 | But the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying to his disciples: Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?'
      v:031: 'LUK:5:31 | 31 | 31 | And Jesus answering, said to them: They that are whole need not the physician: but they that are sick.'
      v:032: 'LUK:5:32 | 32 | 32 | I came not to call the just, but sinners to penance.'
      v:033: 'LUK:5:33 | 33 | 33 | And they said to him: Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and the disciples of the Pharisees in like manner; but thine eat and drink?'
      v:034: 'LUK:5:34 | 34 | 34 | To whom he said: Can you make the children of the bridegroom fast whilst the bridegroom is with them?'
      v:035: 'LUK:5:35 | 35 | 35 | But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them: then shall they fast in those days.'
      v:036: 'LUK:5:36 | 36 | 36 | And he spoke also a similitude to them: That no man putteth a piece from a new garment upon an old garment: otherwise he both rendeth the new, and the piece taken from the new agreeth not with the old.'
      v:037: 'LUK:5:37 | 37 | 37 | And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: otherwise the new wine will break the bottles; and it will be spilled and the bottles will be lost.'
      v:038: 'LUK:5:38 | 38 | 38 | But new wine must be put into new bottles: and both are preserved.'
      v:039: 'LUK:5:39 | 39 | 39 | And no man drinking old hath presently a mind to new: for he saith: The old is better.'

      v:004: 'LUK:8:4 | 4 | 4 | And when a very great multitude was gathered together and hastened out of the cities, unto him, he spoke by a similitude.'
      v:005: 'LUK:8:5 | 5 | 5 | The sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the way side. And it was trodden down: and the fowls of the air devoured it.'

      v:029: 'LUK:8:29 | 29 | 29 | For he commanded the unclean spirit to go out of the man. for many times it seized him: and he was bound with chains and kept in fetters: and breaking the bonds, he was driven by the devil into the deserts.'
      v:030: 'LUK:8:30 | 30 | 30 | And Jesus asked him, saying: What is thy name? But he said: Legion. Because many devils were entered into him.'

      v:038: 'LUK:8:38 | 38 | 38 | Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying:'
      v:039: 'LUK:8:39 | 39 | 39 | Return to thy house and tell how great things God hath done to thee. And he went through the whole city, publishing how great things Jesus had done to him.'

      v:043: 'LUK:8:43 | 43 | 43 | And there was a certain woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had bestowed all her substance on physicians and could not be healed by any.'
      v:044: 'LUK:8:44 | 44 | 44 | She came behind him and touched the hem of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stopped.'
      v:045: 'LUK:8:45 | 45 | 45 | And Jesus said: Who is it that touched me? And all denying, Peter and they that were with him said: Master, the multitudes throng and press thee; and dost thou say, who touched me?'
      v:046: 'LUK:8:46 | 46 | 46 | And Jesus said: Somebody hath touched me; for I know that virtue is gone out from me.'

      v:004: 'LUK:14:4 | 4 | 4 | But they held their peace. But he taking him, healed him and sent him away.'
      v:005: 'LUK:14:5 | 5 | 5 | And answering them, he said: Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fall into a pit and will not immediately draw him out, on the sabbath day?'
      v:006: LUK:14:6 | 6 | 6 | And they could not answer him to these things.
      v:007: 'LUK:14:7 | 7 | 7 | And he spoke a parable also to them that were invited, marking how they chose the first seats at the table, saying to them:'
      v:008: 'LUK:14:8 | 8 | 8 | When thou art invited to a wedding, sit not down in the first place, lest perhaps one more honourable than thou be invited by him:'
      v:009: 'LUK:14:9 | 9 | 9 | And he that invited thee and him, come and say to thee: Give this man place. And then thou begin with shame to take the lowest place.'
      v:010: 'LUK:14:10 | 10 | 10 | But when thou art invited, go, sit down in the lowest place; that when he who invited thee cometh, he may say to thee: Friend, go up higher. Then shalt thou have glory before them that sit at table with thee.'
      v:011: 'LUK:14:11 | 11 | 11 | Because every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.'
      v:012: 'LUK:14:12 | 12 | 12 | And he said to him also that had invited him: When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends nor thy brethren nor thy kinsmen nor thy neighbours who are rich; lest perhaps they also invite thee again, and a recompense be made to thee.'
      v:013: 'LUK:14:13 | 13 | 13 | But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame and the blind.'
      v:014: 'LUK:14:14 | 14 | 14 | And thou shalt be blessed, because they have not wherewith to make thee recompense: for recompense shall be made thee at the resurrection of the just.'
      v:015: 'LUK:14:15 | 15 | 15 | When one of them that sat at table with him had heard these things, he said to him: Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.'

      v:017: 'LUK:14:17 | 17 | 17 | And he sent his servant at the hour of supper to say to them that were invited, that they should come: for now all things are ready.'
      v:018: 'LUK:14:18 | 18 | 18 | And they began all at once to make excuse. The first said to him: I have bought a farm and I must needs go out and see it. I pray thee, hold me excused.'
      v:019: 'LUK:14:19 | 19 | 19 | And another said: I have bought five yoke of oxen and I go to try them. I pray thee, hold me excused.'

      v:021: 'LUK:14:21 | 21 | 21 | And the servant returning, told these things to his lord. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant: Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city; and bring in hither the poor and the feeble and the blind and the lame.'
      v:022: 'LUK:14:22 | 22 | 22 | And the servant said: Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded; and yet there is room.'
      v:023: 'LUK:14:23 | 23 | 23 | And the Lord said to the servant: Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.'

      v:004: 'LUK:15:4 | 4 | 4 | What man of you that hath an hundred sheep, and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after that which was lost, until he find it?'
      v:005: 'LUK:15:5 | 5 | 5 | And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing?'
      v:006: 'LUK:15:6 | 6 | 6 | And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?'
      v:007: 'LUK:15:7 | 7 | 7 | I say to you that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.'
      v:008: 'LUK:15:8 | 8 | 8 | Or what woman having ten groats, if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find it?'

      v:012: 'LUK:15:12 | 12 | 12 | And the younger of them said to his father: Father, give me the portion of substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his substance.'
      v:013: 'LUK:15:13 | 13 | 13 | And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously.'
      v:014: 'LUK:15:14 | 14 | 14 | And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country: and he began to be in want.'
      v:015: LUK:15:15 | 15 | 15 | And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine.
      v:016: 'LUK:15:16 | 16 | 16 | And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.'
      v:017: "LUK:15:17 | 17 | 17 | And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father's house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger!"
      v:018: 'LUK:15:18 | 18 | 18 | I will arise and will go to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee.'
      v:019: 'LUK:15:19 | 19 | 19 | I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.'
      v:020: 'LUK:15:20 | 20 | 20 | And rising up, he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion and running to him fell upon his neck and kissed him.'
      v:021: 'LUK:15:21 | 21 | 21 | And the son said to him: Father: I have sinned against heaven and before thee I am not now worthy to be called thy son.'
      v:022: 'LUK:15:22 | 22 | 22 | And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe and put it on him: and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.'

      v:024: 'LUK:15:24 | 24 | 24 | Because this my son was dead and is come to life again, was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.'
      v:025: 'LUK:15:25 | 25 | 25 | Now his elder son was in the field and when he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.'
      v:026: 'LUK:15:26 | 26 | 26 | And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.'

      v:029: 'LUK:15:29 | 29 | 29 | And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee and I have never transgressed thy commandment: and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends.'

      v:032: 'LUK:15:32 | 32 | 32 | But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.'

    intro: The parable of the unjust steward and of the rich man and Lazarus.
    verses:
      v:001: 'LUK:16:1 | 1 | 1 | And he said also to his disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a steward: and the same was accused unto him, that he had wasted his goods.'
      v:002: 'LUK:16:2 | 2 | 2 | And he called him and said to him: How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship: for now thou canst be steward no longer.'
      v:003: 'LUK:16:3 | 3 | 3 | And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed.'
      v:004: 'LUK:16:4 | 4 | 4 | I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.'
      v:005: "LUK:16:5 | 5 | 5 | Therefore, calling together every one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord?"
      v:006: 'LUK:16:6 | 6 | 6 | But he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.'
      v:007: 'LUK:16:7 | 7 | 7 | Then he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill and write eighty.'
      v:008: 'LUK:16:8 | 8 | 8 | And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.'
      v:009: 'LUK:16:9 | 9 | 9 | And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity: that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.'
      v:010: 'LUK:16:10 | 10 | 10 | He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in that which is greater: and he that is unjust in that which is little is unjust also in that which is greater.'
      v:011: 'LUK:16:11 | 11 | 11 | If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon, who will trust you with that which is the true?'
      v:012: "LUK:16:12 | 12 | 12 | And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?"
      v:013: 'LUK:16:13 | 13 | 13 | No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one and love the other: or he will hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.'
      v:014: 'LUK:16:14 | 14 | 14 | Now the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.'
      v:015: 'LUK:16:15 | 15 | 15 | And he said to them: you are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts. for that which is high to men is an abomination before God.'
      v:016: 'LUK:16:16 | 16 | 16 | The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the kingdom of God is preached: and every one useth violence towards it.'
      v:017: LUK:16:17 | 17 | 17 | And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fall.
      v:018: 'LUK:16:18 | 18 | 18 | Every one that putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.'
      v:019: LUK:16:19 | 19 | 19 | There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and feasted sumptuously every day.
      v:020: 'LUK:16:20 | 20 | 20 | And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full of sores,'
      v:021: "LUK:16:21 | 21 | 21 | Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. And no one did give him: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores."
      v:022: "LUK:16:22 | 22 | 22 | And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell."
      v:023: 'LUK:16:23 | 23 | 23 | And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom:'
      v:024: 'LUK:16:24 | 24 | 24 | And he cried and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.'
      v:025: 'LUK:16:25 | 25 | 25 | And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted and thou art tormented.'
      v:026: 'LUK:16:26 | 26 | 26 | And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you cannot, nor from thence come hither.'
      v:027: "LUK:16:27 | 27 | 27 | And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee that thou wouldst send him to my father's house, for I have five brethren,"
      v:028: 'LUK:16:28 | 28 | 28 | That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.'
      v:029: 'LUK:16:29 | 29 | 29 | And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them.'
      v:030: 'LUK:16:30 | 30 | 30 | But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance.'
      v:031: 'LUK:16:31 | 31 | 31 | And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead.'

    intro: We must pray always. The Pharisee and the publican. The danger of riches. The blind man is restored to sight.
    verses:
      v:001: 'LUK:18:1 | 1 | 1 | And he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray and not to faint,'
      v:002: 'LUK:18:2 | 2 | 2 | Saying: There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God nor regarded man.'
      v:003: 'LUK:18:3 | 3 | 3 | And there was a certain widow in that city; and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary.'
      v:004: 'LUK:18:4 | 4 | 4 | And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God nor regard man,'
      v:005: 'LUK:18:5 | 5 | 5 | Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.'
      v:006: 'LUK:18:6 | 6 | 6 | And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.'
      v:007: 'LUK:18:7 | 7 | 7 | And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night? And will he have patience in their regard?'
      v:008: 'LUK:18:8 | 8 | 8 | I say to you that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?'
      v:009: 'LUK:18:9 | 9 | 9 | And to some who trusted in themselves as just and despised others, he spoke also this parable:'
      v:010: 'LUK:18:10 | 10 | 10 | Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee and the other a publican.'
      v:011: 'LUK:18:11 | 11 | 11 | The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.'
      v:012: 'LUK:18:12 | 12 | 12 | I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.'
      v:013: 'LUK:18:13 | 13 | 13 | And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O God, be merciful to me a sinner.'
      v:014: 'LUK:18:14 | 14 | 14 | I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather than the other: because every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.'
      v:015: 'LUK:18:15 | 15 | 15 | And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.'
      v:016: 'LUK:18:16 | 16 | 16 | But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.'
      v:017: 'LUK:18:17 | 17 | 17 | Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child shall not enter into it.'
      v:018: 'LUK:18:18 | 18 | 18 | And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life?'

      v:022: 'LUK:18:22 | 22 | 22 | Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee. Sell all whatever thou hast and give to the poor: and thou shalt have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me.'
      v:023: 'LUK:18:23 | 23 | 23 | He having heard these things, became sorrowful: for he was very rich.'
      v:024: 'LUK:18:24 | 24 | 24 | And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!'
      v:025: LUK:18:25 | 25 | 25 | For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
      v:026: 'LUK:18:26 | 26 | 26 | And they that heard it said: Who then can be saved?'

      v:030: 'LUK:18:30 | 30 | 30 | Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.'
      v:031: 'LUK:18:31 | 31 | 31 | Then Jesus took unto him the twelve and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man.'
      v:032: LUK:18:32 | 32 | 32 | For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles and shall be mocked and scourged and spit upon.
      v:033: 'LUK:18:33 | 33 | 33 | And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death. And the third day he shall rise again.'
      v:034: 'LUK:18:34 | 34 | 34 | And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them: and they understood not the things that were said.'
      v:035: 'LUK:18:35 | 35 | 35 | Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.'
      v:036: 'LUK:18:36 | 36 | 36 | And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.'
      v:037: LUK:18:37 | 37 | 37 | And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
      v:038: 'LUK:18:38 | 38 | 38 | And he cried out, saying: Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.'
      v:039: 'LUK:18:39 | 39 | 39 | And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.'
      v:040: 'LUK:18:40 | 40 | 40 | And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,'
      v:041: 'LUK:18:41 | 41 | 41 | Saying; What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.'
      v:042: 'LUK:18:42 | 42 | 42 | And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.'
      v:043: 'LUK:18:43 | 43 | 43 | And immediately he saw and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.'

But this commemoration, or remembrance, is by no means inconsistent with the real presence of his body and blood, under these sacramental veils, which represent his death; on the contrary, it is the manner that he himself hath commanded, of commemorating and celebrating his death, by offering in sacrifice, and receiving in the sacrament, that body and blood by which we were redeemed.'

The porteress that let him in, and afterwards seeing him at the fire, first put the question to him; and then positively affirmed that he was with Christ. 2. Another maid accused him to the standers by; and gave occasion to the man here mentioned to renew the charge against him, which caused the second denial. 3. Others of the company took notice of his being a Galilean; and were seconded by the kinsman of Malchus, who affirmed he had seen him in the garden. And this drew on the third denial."
