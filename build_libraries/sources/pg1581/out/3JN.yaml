      v:002: '3JN:1:2 | 2 | 2 | Dearly beloved, concerning all things I make it my prayer that thou mayest proceed prosperously and fare well, as thy soul doth prosperously.'
      v:003: '3JN:1:3 | 3 | 3 | I was exceedingly glad when the brethren came and gave testimony to the truth in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.'
      v:004: '3JN:1:4 | 4 | 4 | I have no greater grace than this, to hear that my children walk in truth.'

      v:006: '3JN:1:6 | 6 | 6 | Who have given testimony to thy charity in the sight of the church. Whom thou shalt do well to bring forward on their way in a manner worthy of God:'
      v:007: '3JN:1:7 | 7 | 7 | Because, for his name they went out, taking nothing of the Gentiles.'
      v:008: '3JN:1:8 | 8 | 8 | We therefore ought to receive such: that we may be fellow helpers of the truth.'
      v:009: '3JN:1:9 | 9 | 9 | I had written perhaps to the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, doth not receive us.'
      v:010: '3JN:1:10 | 10 | 10 | For this cause, if I come, I will advertise his works which he doth, with malicious words prating against us.

      v:011: '3JN:1:11 | 11 | 11 | Dearly beloved, follow not that which is evil: but that which is good. He that doth good is of God: he that doth evil hath not seen God.'
