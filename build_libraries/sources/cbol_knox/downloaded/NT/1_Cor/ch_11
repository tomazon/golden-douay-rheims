	  <img align=right src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
<p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
<p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
<p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.
<p>
<b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

				content: "vv. 4, 5: ‘To bring shame upon one’s head’ should probably be understood in a double sense; that of treating one’s own body with disrespect, and that of disloyalty to one’s own spiritual head; the man muffling himself up, as if he were ashamed of Christ to whom he prays, the woman shewing her face in public, and so infringing the rights of her husband. v. 5: It appears that a woman’s head was sometimes shaved close by way of branding her as having been guilty of incontinence. This may be the meaning here, or it may refer to shameless women in Corinthian society who shaved their heads to look like men."

				id_comment: 3095,
				source_str: '✻',
				caption: '',
				content: "This verse, which is here literally rendered, remains very obscure, in spite of the commentators. The word translated ‘authority’ may mean authority, or power to do things, or (most commonly in this epistle) liberty of choice. If we understand that the wife ought to wear on her head a symbol of her husband’s authority over her, we satisfy the sense, but give a very strained interpretation of the Greek. If we understand that the wife has power over her own head, liberty to dispose of it as she likes, the Greek is satisfied, but the whole sense of the context is ignored. Some think that St Paul is here giving a literal translation of a Hebrew word meaning ‘veil’, derived from a verb which means ‘to control’; but it is hard to see why he should have done so. Most commentators understand ‘for the angels’ sake’ as meaning that the angels join with us in worship, and therefore we must be careful to shew all possible reverence in church; some think that St Paul is citing the example of those angels who veil their faces before the presence of God (Is. 6.2)."
			},
					3096: {
				id_comment: 3096,
				source_str: '✻',
				caption: '',
				content: "vv. 3-16: It is not clear why St Paul here appears to regulate the conditions under which women may undertake public utterances, when in 14.34 below he lays it down that women are not to speak openly in the Christian assembly. If we suppose, as some authors do, that Christian women wore a heavy veil in front of their faces, such as was used in Eastern countries, the difficulty disappears; in forbidding women to speak unveiled the Apostle is forbidding them to speak at all. Others suggest that the prohibition here applies, not to formal assemblies for worship, but for occasional meetings in private houses."

				content: "vv. 17-34. It is clear that the early Christians met (not literally in a church, for there were then no dedicated buildings) for an agape or love-feast, followed by celebration of the Holy Eucharist. This should have been a common meal, to which all contributed; instead of which a rich Corinthian would eat the food he himself had brought, while his poorer neighbour came late (verse 33) so as not to disclose his poverty. This exclusiveness and want of charity meant that when the Eucharist was finally celebrated many of the faithful were in bad dispositions."
