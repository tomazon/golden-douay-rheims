      v:026:

But why should Chanaan be cursed for his father's faults? The Hebrews answer, that he being then a boy, was the first that saw his grandfather's nakedness, and told his father Cham of it; and joined with him in laughing at it: which drew upon him, rather than upon the rest of the children of Cham, this prophetical curse."

      v:012: 'GEN:38:12 | 12 | 12 | And after many days were past, the daughter of Sue the wife of Juda died: and when he had taken comfort after his mourning, he went up to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep, he and Hiras the Odollamite the shepherd of his flock.'
      v:013: GEN:38:13 | 13 | 13 | And it was told Thamar that her father in law was come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep.
      v:014: 'GEN:38:14 | 14 | 14 | And she put off the garments of her widowhood, and took a veil: and changing her dress, sat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas: because Sela was grown up, and she had not been married to him.'
      v:015: 'GEN:38:15 | 15 | 15 | When Juda saw her, he thought she was a harlot: for she had covered her face, lest she should be known.'
      v:016: 'GEN:38:16 | 16 | 16 | And going to her, he said: Suffer me to lie with thee: for he knew her not to be his daughter in law. And she answered: What wilt thou give me to enjoy my company?'
      v:017: 'GEN:38:17 | 17 | 17 | He said: I will send thee a kid out of the flock. And when she said again: I will suffer what thou wilt, if thou give a pledge, till thou send what thou promisest,'
      v:018: 'GEN:38:18 | 18 | 18 | Juda said: What wilt thou have for a pledge? She answered: Thy ring and bracelet, and the staff which thou holdest in thy hand. The woman therefore at one copulation conceived.'
      v:019: 'GEN:38:19 | 19 | 19 | And she arose and went her way: and putting off the apparel which she had taken, put on the garments of her widowhood.'
      v:020: 'GEN:38:20 | 20 | 20 | And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the Odollamite, that he might receive the pledge again, which he had given to the woman: but he, not finding her,'
      v:021: 'GEN:38:21 | 21 | 21 | Asked the men of that place: Where is the woman that sat in the cross way? And when they all made answer: There was no harlot in this place,'
      v:022: 'GEN:38:22 | 22 | 22 | He returned to Juda, and said to him: I have not found her; moreover the men of that place said to me, that there never sat a harlot there.'
      v:023: 'GEN:38:23 | 23 | 23 | Juda said: Let her take it to herself; surely she cannot charge us with a lie: I sent the kid which I promised: and thou didst not find her.'
      v:024: 'GEN:38:24 | 24 | 24 | And behold after three months they told Juda, saying: Thamar, thy daughter in law hath played the harlot, and she appeareth to have a big belly. And Juda said: Bring her out that she may be burnt.'
      v:025: 'GEN:38:25 | 25 | 25 | But when she was led to execution, she sent to her father in law, saying: By the man, to whom these things belong, I am with child. See whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this is.'
      v:026: 'GEN:38:26 | 26 | 26 | But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She is juster than I: because I did not give her to Sela, my son. However, he knew her no more.'
      v:027: 'GEN:38:27 | 27 | 27 | And when she was ready to be brought to bed, there appeared twins in her womb: and in the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying:'
      v:028: GEN:38:28 | 28 | 28 | This shall come forth the first.
      v:029: 'GEN:38:29 | 29 | 29 | But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth: and the woman said: Why is the partition divided for thee? and therefore called his name Phares.'
      v:030: 'GEN:38:30 | 30 | 30 | Afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread: and she called him Zara.'

      v:034: 'GEN:42:34 | 34 | 34 | And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not spies: and you may receive this man again, that is kept in prison: and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will.'
      v:035: 'GEN:42:35 | 35 | 35 | When they had told this, they poured out their corn and every man found his money tied in the mouth of his sack: and all being astonished together,'
      v:036: 'GEN:42:36 | 36 | 36 | Their father Jacob said: You have made me to be without children: Joseph is not living, Simeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will take away: all these evils are fallen upon me.'

Excelling in gifts, etc., because the firstborn had a title to a double portion, and to have the command over his brethren, which Ruben forfeited by his sin; being poured out as water, that is, spilt and lost.'
          quote: My strength
      v:004:
        - note: 'This was not meant by way of a curse or imprecation; but by way of a prophecy foretelling that the tribe of Ruben should not inherit the pre-eminences usually annexed to the first birthright, viz., the double portion, the being prince or lord over the other brethren, and the priesthood: of which the double portion was given to Joseph, the princely office to Juda, and the priesthood to Levi.'
          quote: Grow thou not
      v:006:
        - note: 'viz., Sichem the son of Hemor, with all his people, Gen. 34.; mystically and prophetically it alludes to Christ, whom their posterity, viz., the priests and the scribes, put to death.'
          quote: 'Slew a man,'
      v:009:
        - note: 'This blessing of Juda foretelleth the strength of his tribe, the fertility of his inheritance; and principally that the sceptre and legislative power should not be utterly taken away from his race till about the time of the coming of Christ: as in effect it never was: which is a demonstration against the modern Jews, that the Messiah is long since come; for the sceptre has long since been utterly taken away from Juda.'
          quote: A lion's whelp
      v:016:
        - note: 'This was verified in Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan, and began to deliver Israel. Judges 13. 5. But as this deliverance was but temporal and very imperfect, the holy patriarch (ver. 18) aspires after another kind of deliverer, saying: I will look for thy salvation, O Lord.'
          quote: Dan shall judge
      v:019:
        - note: 'It seems to allude to the tribe of Gad; when after they had received for their lot the land of Galaad, they marched in arms before the rest of the Israelites, to the conquest of the land of Chanaan: from whence they afterwards returned loaded with spoils. See Jos. 4. and 12.'
          quote: Gad being girded
      v:022:
        - note: 'To behold his beauty; whilst his envious brethren turned their darts against him, etc.'
          quote: Run to and fro
      v:024:
        - note: 'That is, upon God, who was his strength: who also loosed his bands, and brought him out of prison to be the pastor, that is, the feeder and ruler of Egypt, and the stone, that is, the rock and support of Israel.'
          quote: His bow rested upon the strong
      v:026:
        - note: "That is, thy father's blessings are made more prevalent and effectual in thy regard, by the additional strength they receive from his inheriting the blessings of his progenitors Abraham and Isaac."
          quote: The blessings of thy father
        - note: 'These blessings all looked forward towards Christ, called the desire of the everlasting hills, as being longed for, as it were, by the whole creation. Mystically, the patriarchs and prophets are called the everlasting hills, by reason of the eminence of their wisdom and holiness.'
          quote: The desire of the everlasting hills
        - note: 'This word signifies one separated; and agrees to Joseph, as being separated from, and more eminent than, his brethren. As the ancient Nazarites were so called from their being set aside for God, and vowed to him.'
          quote: The Nazarite
      v:029:
        - note: 'That is, I am going to die, and so to follow my ancestors that are gone before me, and to join their company in another world.'
          quote: To be gathered to my people
