      v:011: 'PHP:1:11 | 11 | 11 | Filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.'

      v:017: 'PHP:1:17 | 17 | 17 | And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they raise affliction to my bands.'
      v:018: 'PHP:1:18 | 18 | 18 | But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.'

Whatsoever of good fame-- That is, that by our conduct and behaviour we should edify our neighbours, and give them good example by our actions. If there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline-- that those in error, by seeing the morality and good discipline of the true religion, may be converted. And finally, the apostle commands, not only the Philippians, but all Christians, to think on these things-- that is, to make it their study and concern that the peace of God might be with them.'
