<p class=desc>Lessons of avoiding scandal and of the efficacy of faith. The ten lepers. The manner of the coming of Christ.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And he said to his disciples: It is impossible that scandals should not come: but woe to him through whom they come.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>It were better for him, that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother sin against thee, reprove him: and if he do penance, forgive him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day be converted unto thee, saying, I repent; forgive him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And the apostles said to the Lord: Increase our faith.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And the Lord said: If you had faith like to a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mulberry tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou transplanted into the sea: and it would obey you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>But which of you having a servant ploughing, or feeding cattle, will say to him, when he is come from the field: Immediately go, sit down to meat:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And will not rather say to him: Make ready my supper, and gird thyself, and serve me, whilst I eat and drink, and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>Doth he thank that servant, for doing the things which he commanded him?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>I think not. So you also, when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are <u>unprofitable servants</u>; we have done that which we ought to do.
</p>
<p class=note>
[10] <u>"Unprofitable servants"</u>: Because our service is of no profit to our master; and he justly claims it as our bounden duty. But though we are unprofitable to him, our serving him is not unprofitable to us; for he is pleased to give by his grace a value to our good works, which, in consequence of his promise, entitles them to an eternal reward.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off;
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, master, have mercy on us.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back, with a loud voice glorifying God.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks: and this was a Samaritan.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And Jesus answering, said, Were not ten made clean? and where are the nine?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this stranger.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And he said to him: Arise, go thy way; for thy faith hath made thee whole.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come? he answered them, and said: The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>Neither shall they say: Behold here, or behold there. For lo, the kingdom of God is within you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when you shall desire to see one day of the Son of man; and you shall not see it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And they will say to you: See here, and see there. Go ye not after, nor follow them:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>For as the lightning that lighteneth from under heaven, shineth unto the parts that are under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And as it came to pass in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>They did eat and drink, they married wives, and were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark: and the flood came and destroyed them all.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>Likewise as it came to pass, in the days of Lot: they did eat and drink, they bought and sold, they planted and built.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that shall be in the field, in like manner, let him not return back.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>Remember Lot's wife.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose it, shall preserve it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>I say to you: in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>Two women shall be grinding together: the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left: two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>They answering, say to him: Where, Lord?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=17&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>Who said to them: Wheresoever the body shall be, thither will the eagles also be gathered together.
