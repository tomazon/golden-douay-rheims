<p class=desc>A canticle for the remembrance of the law. Moses is commanded to go up into a mountain, from whence he shall see the promised land but not enter into it.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Hear, O ye heavens, the things I speak, let the earth give ear to the words of my mouth.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>Let my doctrine gather as the rain, let my speech distil as the dew, as a shower upon the herb, and as drops upon the grass.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>Because I will invoke the name of the Lord: give ye magnificence to our God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>The works of God are perfect, and all his ways are judgments: God is faithful and without any iniquity, he is just and right.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>They have sinned against him, and are not of his children in their filth: they are a wicked and perverse generation.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>Is this the return thou makest to the Lord, O foolish and senseless people? Is not he thy father, that hath possessed thee, and made thee, and created thee?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>Remember the days of old, think upon every generation: ask thy father, and he will declare to thee: thy elders and they will tell thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>When the Most High divided the nations: when he separated the sons of Adam, he appointed the bounds of people according to the number of the children of Israel.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>But the Lord's portion is his people: Jacob the lot of his inheritance.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>He found him in a desert land, in a place of horror, and of vast wilderness: he led him about, and taught him: and he kept him as the apple of his eye.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>As the eagle enticing her young to fly, and hovering over them, he spread his wings, and hath taken him and carried him on his shoulders.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>The Lord alone was his leader: and there was no strange god with him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>He set him upon high land: that he might eat the fruits of the fields, that he might suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the hardest stone,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>Butter of the herd, and milk of the sheep with the fat of lambs, and of the rams of the breed of Basan: and goats with the marrow of wheat, and might drink the purest blood of the grape.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>The beloved grew fat, and kicked: he grew fat, and thick and gross, he forsook God who made him, and departed from God his saviour.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>They provoked him by strange gods, and stirred him up to anger, with their abominations.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>They sacrificed to devils and not to God: to gods whom they knew not: that were newly come up, whom their fathers worshipped not.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>Thou hast forsaken the God that beget thee, and hast forgotten the Lord that created thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>The Lord saw, and was moved to wrath: because his own sons and daughters provoked him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And he said: I will hide my face from them, and will consider what their last end shall be: for it is a perverse generation, and unfaithful children.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>They have provoked me with that which was no god, and have angered me with their vanities: and I will provoke them with that which is no people, and will vex them with a foolish nation.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>A fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burn even to the lowest hell: and shall devour the earth with her increase, and shall burn the foundations of the mountains.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>I will heap evils upon them, and will spend my arrows among them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>They shall be consumed with famine, and birds shall devour them with a most bitter bite: I will send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground, and of serpents.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>Without, the sword shall lay them waste, and terror within, both the young man and the virgin, the sucking child with the man in years.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>I said: Where are they? I will make the memory of them to cease from among men.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>But for the wrath of the enemies I have deferred it: lest perhaps their enemies might be proud, and should say: Our mighty hand, and not the Lord, hath done all these things.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>They are a nation without counsel, and without wisdom.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>O that they would be wise and would understand, and would provide for their last end.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>How should one pursue after a thousand, and two chase ten thousand? Was it not, because their God had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>For our God is not as their gods: our enemies themselves are judges.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>Their vines are of the vineyard of Sodom, and of the suburbs of Gomorrha: their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters most bitter.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>Their wine is the gall of dragons, and the venom of asps, which is incurable.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>Are not these things stored up with me, and sealed up in my treasures?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time, that their foot may slide: the day of destruction is at hand, and the time makes haste to come.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>The Lord will judge his people, and will have mercy on his servants: he shall see that their hand is weakened, and that they who were shut up have also failed, and they that remained are consumed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And he shall say: Where are their gods, in whom they trusted?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>Of whose victims they ate the fat, and drank the wine of their drink offerings: let them arise and help you, and protect you in your distress.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>See ye that I alone am, and there is no other God besides me: I will kill and I will make to live: I will strike, and I will heal, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>I will lift up my hand to heaven, and I will say: I live for ever.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>If I shall whet my sword as the lightning, and my hand take hold on judgment: I will render vengeance to my enemies, and repay them that hate me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, of the blood of the slain and of the captivity, of the bare head of the enemies.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>Praise his people, ye nations, for he will revenge the blood of his servants: and will render vengeance to their enemies, and he will be merciful to the land of his people.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>So Moses came and spoke all the words of this canticle in the ears of the people, and Josue the son of Nun.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>And he ended all these words, speaking to all Israel.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>And he said to them: Set your hearts on all the words, which I testify to you this day: which you shall command your children to observe and to do, and to fulfill all that is written in this law:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>For they are not commanded you in vain, but that every one should live in them, and that doing them you may continue a long time in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=48-#x">&nbsp;48&nbsp;</a>And the Lord spoke to Moses the same day, saying:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=49-#x">&nbsp;49&nbsp;</a>Go up into this mountain Abarim, (that is to say, of passages,) unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho: and see the land of Chanaan, which I will deliver to the children of Israel to possess, and die thou in the mountain.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=50-#x">&nbsp;50&nbsp;</a>When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=51-#x">&nbsp;51&nbsp;</a>Because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel, at the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of Sin: and you did not sanctify me among the children of Israel.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=5&ch=32&l=52-#x">&nbsp;52&nbsp;</a>Thou shalt see the land before thee, which I will give to the children of Israel, but thou shalt not enter into it.
