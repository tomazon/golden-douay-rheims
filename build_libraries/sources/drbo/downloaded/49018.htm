<p class=desc>We must pray always. The Pharisee and the publican. The danger of riches. The blind man is restored to sight.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray, and not to faint,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>Saying: There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God, nor regarded man.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying: <u>Avenge</u> me of my adversary.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor regard man,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.
</p>
<p class=note>
[3] <u>"Avenge"</u>: That is, do me justice. It is a Hebraism.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in their regard?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he spoke also this parable:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O God, be merciful to me a sinner.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather than the other: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child, shall not enter into it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good? None is good but God alone.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Honour thy father and mother.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee: sell all whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>He having heard these things, became sorrowful; for he was very rich.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And they that heard it, said: Who then can be saved?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>He said to them: The things that are impossible with men, are possible with God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>Who said to them: Amen, I say to you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood not the things that were said.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>And he cried out, saying: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>Saying: What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=18&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
