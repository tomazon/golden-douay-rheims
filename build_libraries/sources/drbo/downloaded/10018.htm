<p class=desc>Absalom is defeated, and slain by Joab. David mourneth for him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And David having reviewed his people, appointed over them captains of thousands and of hundreds,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abisai the son of Sarvia Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ethai, who was of Geth: and the king said to the people: I also will go forth with you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And the people answered: Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not much mind us: or if half of us should fall, they will not greatly care: for thou alone art accounted for ten thousand: it is better therefore that thou shouldst be in the city to succour us.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And the king said to them: What seemeth good to you, that will I do. And the king stood by the gate: and all the people went forth by their troops, by hundreds and by thousands.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And the king commanded Joab, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy Absalom. And all the people heard the king giving charge to all the princes concerning Absalom.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>So the people went out into the field against Israel and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And the people of Israel were defeated there by David's army, and a great slaughter was made that day of twenty thousand men.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the country, and there were many more of the people whom the forest <u>consumed</u>, than whom the sword devoured that day.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And it happened that Absalom met the servants of David, riding on a mule: and as the mule went under a thick and large oak, his head stuck in the oak: and while he hung between the heaven and the earth, the mule on which he rode passed on.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And one saw this and told Joab, saying: I saw Absalom hanging upon an oak.
</p>
<p class=note>
[8] <u>"Consumed"</u>: Viz., by pits and precipices.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And Joab said to the man that told him: If thou sawest him, why didst thou not stab him to the ground, and I would have given thee ten sicles of silver, and belt?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And he said to Joab: If thou wouldst have paid down in my hands a thousand pieces of silver, I would not lay my hands upon the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy Absalom.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Yea and if I should have acted boldly against my own life, this could not have been hid from the king, and wouldst thou have stood by me?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And Joab said: Not as thou wilt, but will set upon him in thy sight. So he took three lances in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom: and whilst he yet panted for life, sticking on the oak,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Ten young men, armourbearers of Joab, ran up, and striking him slew him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And Joab sounded the trumpet, and kept back the people from pursuing after Israel in their flight, being willing to spare the multitude.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and they laid an exceeding great heap of stones upon him: but all Israel fled to their own dwellings.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>Now Absalom had reared up for himself, in his lifetime, a pillar, which is in the king's valley: for he said: I have <u>no son</u>, and this shall be the monument of my name. And he called the pillar by his own name, and it is called the hand of Absalom, to this day.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said: I will run and tell the king, that the Lord hath done judgment for him from the hand of his enemies.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And Joab said to him: Thou shalt not be the messenger this day, but shalt bear tidings another day: this day I will not have thee bear tidings, because the king's son is dead.
</p>
<p class=note>
[18] <u>"No son"</u>: The sons mentioned above, chap. 14. 27, were dead when this pillar was erected: unless we suppose he raised this pillar before they were born.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And Joab said to Chusai: Go, and tell the king what thou hast seen. Chusai bowed down to Joab, and ran.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>Then Achimaas the son of Sadoc said to Joab again: Why might not I also run after Chusai? And Joab said to him: Why wilt thou run, my son? thou wilt not be the bearer of good tidings.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>He answered: But what if I run? And he said to him: Run. Then Achimaas running by a nearer way passed Chusai.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman that was on the top of the gate upon the wall, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running alone.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And crying out he told the king: and the king said: If he be alone, there are good tidings in his mouth. And as he was coming apace, and drawing nearer,
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>The watchman saw another man running, and crying aloud from above, he said: I see another man running alone. And the king said: He also is a good messenger.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And the watchman said: The running of the foremost seemeth to me like the running of Achimaas the son of Sadoc. And the king said: He is a good man: and cometh with good news.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And Achimaas crying out, said to the king: God save thee, O king. And falling down before the king with his face to the ground, he said: Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath shut up the men that have lifted up their hands against the lord my king.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And the king said: Is the young man Absalom safe? And Achimaas said: I saw a great tumult, O king, when thy servant Joab sent me thy servant: I know nothing else.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And the king said to him: Pass, and stand here.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>And when he had passed, and stood still, Chusai appeared: and coming up he said: I bring good tidings, my lord, the king, for the Lord hath judged for thee this day from the hand of all that have risen up against thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And the king said to Chusai: Is the young man Absalom safe? And Chusai answering him, said: Let the enemies of my lord, the king, and all that rise against him unto evil, be as the young man is.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=18&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>The king therefore being much moved, went up to the high chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went he spoke in this manner: My son Absalom, Absalom my son: <u>would to God</u> that I might die for thee, Absalom my son, my son Absalom.
<p class=note>
[33] <u>"Would to God"</u>: David lamented the death of Absalom, because of the wretched state in which he died: and therefore would have been glad to have saved his life, even by dying for him. In which he was a figure of Christ weeping, praying and dying for his rebellious children, and even for them that crucified him.
