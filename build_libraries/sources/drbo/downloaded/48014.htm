<p class=desc>The first part of the history of the passion of Christ.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Now the feast of the pasch, and of the <u>Azymes</u> was after two days; and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him, and kill him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard: and breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>Now there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
</p>
<p class=note>
[1] <u>"Azymes"</u>: That is, the feast of the unleavened bread.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>But Jesus said: Let her alone, why do you molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for burial.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memorial of her.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>Who hearing it were glad; and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the pasch?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him;
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And he will shew you a large dining room furnished; and there prepare ye for us.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And his disciples went their way, and came into the city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the pasch.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>But they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Is it I?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke, and gave to them, and said: Take ye. This is my body.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>Amen I say to you, that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And when they had said an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And Jesus saith to them: You will all be scandalized in my regard this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>But Peter saith to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And Jesus saith to him: Amen I say to thee, today, even in this night, before the cock <u>crow twice</u>, thou shall deny me thrice.
</p>
<p class=note>
[30] <u>"Crow twice"</u>: The cocks crow at two different times of the night; viz., about midnight for the first time; and then about the time commonly called the cock crowing; and this was the cock crowing our Saviour spoke of; and therefore the other Evangelists take no notice of the first crowing.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: Sit you here, while I pray.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you here, and watch.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground; and he prayed, that if it might be, the hour might pass from him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>And he saith: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? couldst thou not watch one hour?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>And going away again, he prayed, saying the same words.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>And when he returned, he found them again asleep, (for their eyes were heavy,) and they knew not what to answer him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>And he cometh the third time, and saith to them: Sleep ye now, and take your rest. It is enough: the hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>Rise up, let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve: and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>And he that betrayed him, had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; lay hold on him, and lead him away carefully.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>And when he was come, immediately going up to him, he saith: Hail, Rabbi; and he kissed him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>But they laid hands on him, and held him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>And one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=48-#x">&nbsp;48&nbsp;</a>And Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=49-#x">&nbsp;49&nbsp;</a>I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may be fulfilled.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=50-#x">&nbsp;50&nbsp;</a>Then his disciples leaving him, all fled away.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=51-#x">&nbsp;51&nbsp;</a>And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and they laid hold on him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=52-#x">&nbsp;52&nbsp;</a>But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=53-#x">&nbsp;53&nbsp;</a>And they brought Jesus to the high priest; and all the priests and the scribes and the ancients assembled together.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=54-#x">&nbsp;54&nbsp;</a>And Peter followed him from afar off, even into the court of the high priest; and he sat with the servants at the fire, and warmed himself.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=55-#x">&nbsp;55&nbsp;</a>And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death, and found none.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=56-#x">&nbsp;56&nbsp;</a>For many bore false witness against him, and their evidences were not agreeing.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=57-#x">&nbsp;57&nbsp;</a>And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=58-#x">&nbsp;58&nbsp;</a>We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another not made with hands.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=59-#x">&nbsp;59&nbsp;</a>And their witness did not agree.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=60-#x">&nbsp;60&nbsp;</a>And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=61-#x">&nbsp;61&nbsp;</a>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him: Art thou the Christ the Son of the blessed God?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=62-#x">&nbsp;62&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=63-#x">&nbsp;63&nbsp;</a>Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What need we any further witnesses?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=64-#x">&nbsp;64&nbsp;</a>You have heard the blasphemy. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=65-#x">&nbsp;65&nbsp;</a>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him: Prophesy: and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=66-#x">&nbsp;66&nbsp;</a>Now when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maidservants of the high priest.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=67-#x">&nbsp;67&nbsp;</a>And when she had seen Peter warming himself, looking on him she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=68-#x">&nbsp;68&nbsp;</a>But he denied, saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=69-#x">&nbsp;69&nbsp;</a>And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=70-#x">&nbsp;70&nbsp;</a>But he denied again. And after a while they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=71-#x">&nbsp;71&nbsp;</a>But he began to curse and to swear, saying; I know not this man of whom you speak.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=14&l=72-#x">&nbsp;72&nbsp;</a>And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep.
