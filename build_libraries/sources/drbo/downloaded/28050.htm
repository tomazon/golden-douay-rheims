<p class=desc>Babylon, which hath afflicted the Israelites, after their restoration, shall be utterly destroyed.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>The word that the Lord hath spoken against Babylon, and against the land of the Chaldeans in the hand of Jeremias the prophet.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>Declare ye among the nations, and publish it, lift up a standard: proclaim, and conceal it not: say: Babylon is taken, <u>Bel</u> is confounded, Merodach is overthrown, their graven things are confounded, their idols are overthrown.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>For <u>a nation</u> is come up against her out of the north, which shall make her land desolate: and there shall be none to dwell therein, from man even to beast: yea they are removed, and gone away.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>In those days, and at that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Juda together: going and weeping they shall make haste, and shall seek the Lord their God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>They shall ask the way to Sion, their faces are hitherward. They shall come, and shall be joined to the Lord by an everlasting covenant, which shall never be forgotten.
</p>
<p class=note>
[2] <u>"Bel"</u>: Bel and Merodach were worshipped for gods by the men of Babylon.
</p>
<p class=note>
[3] <u>"A nation"</u>: Viz., the Medes.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>My people have been a lost flock, their shepherds have caused them to go astray, and have made them wander in the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting place.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>All that found them, have devoured them: and their enemies said: We have not sinned in so doing: because they have sinned against the Lord the beauty of justice, and against the Lord the hope of their fathers.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans: and be ye as kids at the head of the flock.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>For behold I raise up, and will bring against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the land of the north: and they shall be prepared against her, and from thence she shall be taken: their arrows, like those of a mighty man, a destroyer, shall not return in vain.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And Chaldea shall be made a prey: all that waste her shall be filled, saith the Lord.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>Because you rejoice, and speak great things, pillaging my inheritance: because you are spread abroad as calves upon the grass, and have bellowed as bulls.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Your mother is confounded exceedingly, and she that bore you is made even with the dust: behold she shall be the last among the nations, a wilderness unpassable, and dry.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be inhabited, but shall be wholly desolate: every one that shall pass by Babylon, shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all her plagues.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>Prepare yourselves against Babylon round about, all you that bend the bow: fight against her, spare not arrows: because she hath sinned against the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Shout against her, she hath everywhere given her hand, her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down, for it is the vengeance of the Lord. Take vengeance upon her: as she hath done, so do to her.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>Destroy the sower out of Babylon, and him that holdeth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the sword of <u>the dove</u> every man shall return to his people, and every one shall flee to his own land.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Israel is a scattered flock, the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria devoured him: and last this Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will visit the king of Babylon and his land, as I have visited the king of Assyria.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And I will bring Israel again to his habitation: and he shall feed on Carmel, and Bason, and his soul shall be satisfied in mount Ephraim, and Galaad.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>In those days, and at that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none: and the sin of Juda, and there shall none be found: for I will be merciful to them, whom I shall leave.
</p>
<p class=note>
[16] <u>"The dove"</u>: Or the destroyer; for the Hebrew word signifies either the one or the other.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>Go up against the land of the rulers, and punish the inhabitants thereof, waste, and destroy all behind them, saith the Lord: and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>A noise of war in the land, and a great destruction.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>How is the hammer of the whole earth broken, and destroyed! how is Babylon turned into a desert among the nations!
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>I have caused thee to fall into a snare, and thou art taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware of it: thou art found and caught, because thou hast provoked the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his wrath: for the Lord the God of hosts hath a work to be done in the land of the Chaldeans.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>Come ye against her from the uttermost borders: open that they may go forth that shall tread her down: take the stones out of the way, and make heaps, and destroy her: and let nothing of her be left.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>Destroy all her valiant men, let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them, for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>The voice of them that flee, and of them that have escaped out of the land of Babylon: to declare in Sion the revenge of the Lord our God, the revenge of his temple.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>Declare to many against Babylon, to all that bend the bow: stand together against her round about, and let none escape; pay her according to her work: according to all that she hath done, do ye to her: for she hath lifted up herself against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets: and all her men of war shall hold their peace in that day, saith the Lord.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>Behold I come against thee, O proud one, saith the Lord the God of hosts: for thy day is come, the time of thy visitation.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And the proud one shall fall, he shall fall down, and there shall be none to lift him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: The children of Israel, and the children of Juda are oppressed together: all that have taken them captives, hold them fast, they will not let them go.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>Their redeemer is strong, the Lord of hosts is his name: he will defend their cause in judgment, to terrify the land, and to disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>A sword upon her diviners, and they shall be foolish: a sword upon her valiant ones, and they shall be dismayed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>A sword upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the people that are in the midst of her: and they shall become as women: a sword upon her treasures, and they shall be made a spoil.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>A drought upon her waters, and they shall be dried up: because it is a land of idols, and they glory in monstrous things.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>Therefore shall dragons dwell there with the <u>fig fauns</u>: and ostriches shall dwell therein, and it shall be no more inhabited for ever, neither shall it be built up from generation to generation.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>As the Lord overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha, and their neighbour cities, saith the Lord: no man shall dwell there, neither shall the son of man inhabit it.
</p>
<p class=note>
[39] <u>"Fig fauns"</u>: Monsters of the desert, or demons in monstrous shapes: such as the ancients called fauns and satyrs; and as they imagined them to live upon wild figs, they called them fauni ficarii or fig fauns.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>Behold a people cometh from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall rise from the ends of the earth.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>They shall take the bow and the shield: they are cruel and unmerciful: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses: like a man prepared for battle against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands are grown feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, pangs as a woman in labour.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>Behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan to the strong and beautiful: for I will make him run suddenly upon her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint over her? for who is like to me? and who shall bear up against me? and who is that shepherd that can withstand my countenance?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath taken against Babylon: and his thoughts which he hath thought against the land of the Chaldeans: surely the little ones of the flocks shall pull them down, of a truth their habitation shall be destroyed with them.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=50&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard amongst the nations.
