<p class=desc>The anointing of Christ's feet. His riding into Jerusalem upon an ass. A voice from heaven.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore, six days before the pasch, came to Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to life.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And they made him a supper there: and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was about to betray him, said:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put therein.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my burial.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>For the poor you have always with you; but <u>me you have not always</u>.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also:
</p>
<p class=note>
[8] <u>"Me you have not always"</u>: Viz., in a visible manner, as when conversant here on earth; and as we have the poor, whom we may daily assist and relieve.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And on the next day, a great multitude that was to come to the festival day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And Jesus found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy king cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>These things his disciples did not know at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>For which reason also the people came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miracle.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? behold, the whole world is gone after him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Now there were certain Gentiles among them, who came up to adore on the festival day.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>Itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life eternal.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him will my Father honour.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this hour.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from heaven: I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>The multitude therefore that stood and heard, said that it thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered, and said: This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>Now is the judgment of the world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>(Now this he said, signifying what death he should die.)
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou: The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things Jesus spoke; and he went away, and hid himself from them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And whereas he had done so many miracles before them, they believed not in him:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who hath believed our hearing? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>Therefore <u>they could not believe</u>, because Isaias said again:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
</p>
<p class=note>
[39] <u>"They could not believe"</u>: Because they would not, saith St. Augustine, Tract. 33, in Joan. See the annotation, St. Mark 4. 12.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>These things said Isaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>However, many of the chief men also believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they might not be cast out of the synagogue.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>But Jesus cried, and said: He that believeth in me, doth not believe in me, but in him that sent me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>I am come a light into the world; that whosoever believeth in me, may not remain in darkness.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>And if any man hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=48-#x">&nbsp;48&nbsp;</a>He that despiseth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=49-#x">&nbsp;49&nbsp;</a>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=12&l=50-#x">&nbsp;50&nbsp;</a>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father said unto me, so do I speak.
