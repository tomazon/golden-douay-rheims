<p class=desc>Christ heals the withered hand. He chooses the twelve. He confutes the blasphemy of the Pharisees.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had a withered hand.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And they watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath days; that they might accuse him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And he said to the man who had the withered hand: Stand up in the midst.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And he saith to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy? But they held their peace.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored unto him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And the Pharisees going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan. And they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he did, came to him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had evils.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Thou art the Son of God. And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself: and they came to him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send them to preach.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And to Simon he gave the name Peter:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he named them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananean:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And they come to a house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him. For they said: He is become mad.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem, said: He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And if Satan be risen up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>No man can enter into the house of a strong man and rob him of his goods, unless he first bind the strong man, and then shall he plunder his house.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>Amen I say to you, that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>Because they said: He hath an unclean spirit.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>And his mother and his brethren came; and standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And the multitude sat about him; and they say to him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And answering them, he said: Who is my mother and my brethren?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>And looking round about on them who sat about him, he saith: Behold my mother and my brethren.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=3&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>For whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.
