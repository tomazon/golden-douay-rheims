<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>After the blood of the guilty was shed, the Lord said to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron, the priest:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>Number the whole sum of the children of Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their houses and kindreds, all that are able to go forth to war.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>Moses therefore and Eleazar the priest, being in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho, spoke to them that were

<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=52-#x">&nbsp;52&nbsp;</a>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=53-#x">&nbsp;53&nbsp;</a>To these shall the land be divided for their possessions according to the number of names.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=54-#x">&nbsp;54&nbsp;</a>To the greater number thou shalt give a greater portion, and to the fewer a less: to every one, as they have now been reckoned up, shall a possession be delivered:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=55-#x">&nbsp;55&nbsp;</a>Yet so that by lot the land be divided to the tribe and families.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=56-#x">&nbsp;56&nbsp;</a>Whatsoever shall fall by lot, that shall be taken by the more, or the fewer.

<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=59-#x">&nbsp;59&nbsp;</a>Who had to wife Jochabed the daughter of Levi, who was born to him in Egypt. She bore to her husband Amram sons, Aaron and Moses, and Mary their sister.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=60-#x">&nbsp;60&nbsp;</a>Of Aaron were born Nadab and Abiu, and Eleazar and Ithamar:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=61-#x">&nbsp;61&nbsp;</a>Of whom Nadab and Abiu died, when they had offered the strange fire before the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=62-#x">&nbsp;62&nbsp;</a>And all that were numbered, were twenty-three thousand males from one month old and upward: for they were not reckoned up among the children of Israel, neither was a possession given to them with the rest.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=63-#x">&nbsp;63&nbsp;</a>This is the number of the children of Israel, that were enrolled by Moses and Eleazar the priest, in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan, over against Jericho.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=64-#x">&nbsp;64&nbsp;</a>Among whom there was not one of them that were numbered before by Moses and Aaron in the desert of Sinai.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=4&ch=26&l=65-#x">&nbsp;65&nbsp;</a>For the Lord had foretold that they should die in the wilderness. And none remained of them, but Caleb the son of Jephone, and Josue the son of Nun.
