<p class=desc>Job's virtue and riches. Satan by permission from God strippeth him of all his substance. His patience.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>There was a man in the land of <u>Hus</u>, whose name was Job, and that man was <u>simple</u> and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceeding great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And his sons went, <u>and made a feast by houses</u> every one in his day. And sending they called their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have <u>blessed</u> God in their hearts. So did Job all days.
</p>
<p class=note>
[1] <u>"Hus"</u>: The land of Hus was a part of Edom; as appears from Lam. 4. 21.-- Ibid.
</p>
<p class=note>
[1] <u>"Simple"</u>: That is, innocent, sincere, and without guile.
</p>
<p class=note>
[4] <u>"And made a feast by houses"</u>: That is, each made a feast in his own house and had his day, inviting the others, and their sisters.
</p>
<p class=note>
[5] <u>"Blessed"</u>: For greater horror of the very thought of blasphemy, the scripture both here and ver. 11, and in the following chapter, ver. 5 and 9, uses the word bless to signify its contrary.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>Now on a certain day when <u>the sons of God</u> came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>Hast not thou made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?
</p>
<p class=note>
[6] <u>"The sons of God"</u>: The angels.-- Ibid. Satan also, etc. This passage represents to us in a figure, accommodated to the ways and understandings of men, 1. The restless endeavours of Satan against the servants of God; 2. That he can do nothing without God's permission; 3. That God doth not permit him to tempt them above their strength: but assists them by his divine grace in such manner, that the vain efforts of the enemy only serve to illustrate their virtue and increase their merit.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he blesseth thee not to thy face.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them, moreover they have slain the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their elder brother:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped,
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=20&ch=1&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God.
