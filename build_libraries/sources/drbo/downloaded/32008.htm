<p class=desc>Daniel's vision of the ram and the he goat interpreted by the angel Gabriel.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>In the third year of the reign of king Baltasar, a vision appeared to me. I Daniel, after what I had seen in the beginning,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>Saw in my vision when I was in the castle of Susa, which is in the province of Elam: and I saw in the vision that I was over the gate of Ulai.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold <u>a ram</u> stood before the water, having two high horns, and one higher than the other, and growing up. 
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>Afterward I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west, and against the north, and against the south: and no beasts could withstand him, nor be delivered out of his hand: and he did according to his own will, and became great.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And I understood: and behold <u>a he goat</u> came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and <u>he touched not the ground</u>, and the he goat had <u>a notable horn</u> between his eyes.
</p>
<p class=note>
[3] <u>"A ram"</u>: The empire of the Medes and Persians.
</p>
<p class=note>
[5] <u>"A he goat"</u>: The empire of the Greeks, or Macedonians. Ibid.
</p>
<p class=note>
[5] <u>"He touched not the ground"</u>: He conquered all before him, with so much rapidity, that he seemed rather to fly, than to walk upon the earth.-- Ibid.
</p>
<p class=note>
[5] <u>"A notable horn"</u>: Alexander the Great.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And he went up to the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing before the gate, and he ran towards him in the force of his strength.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And when he was come near the ram, he was enraged against him, and struck the ram: and broke his two horns, and the ram could not withstand him: and when he had cast him down on the ground, he stamped upon him, and none could deliver the ram out of his hand.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And the he goat became exceeding great: and when he was grown, the great horn was broken, and there came up <u>four horns</u> under it towards the four winds of heaven.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And out of one of them came forth <u>a little horn</u>: and it became great against the south, and against the east, and against the strength.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And it was magnified even <u>unto the strength of heaven</u>: and it threw down of the strength, and of the stars, and trod upon them.
</p>
<p class=note>
[8] <u>"Four horns"</u>: Seleucus, Antigonus, Philip, and Ptolemeus, the successors of Alexander, who divided his empire among them.
</p>
<p class=note>
[9] <u>"A little horn"</u>: Antiochus Epiphanes, a descendant of Seleucus. He grew against the south, and the east, by his victories over the kings of Egypt and Armenia: and against the strength, that is, against Jerusalem and the people of God.
</p>
<p class=note>
[10] <u>"Unto the strength of heaven"</u>: or, against the strength of heaven. So are here called the army of the Jews, the people of God.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And it was magnified even to the prince of the strength: and it took away from him the continual sacrifice, and cast down the place of his sanctuary.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And strength was given him against the continual sacrifice, because of sins: and truth shall be cast down on the ground, and he shall do and shall prosper.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And I heard one of the saints speaking, and one saint said to another, I know not to whom that was speaking: How long shall be the vision, concerning the continual sacrifice, and the sin of the desolation that is made: and the sanctuary, and the strength be trodden under foot?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And he said to him: <u>Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days</u>: and the sanctuary shall be cleansed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass when I Daniel saw the vision, and sought the meaning, that behold there stood before me as it were the appearance of a man.
</p>
<p class=note>
[14] <u>"Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days"</u>: That is, six years and almost four months: which was the whole time from the beginning of the persecution of Antiochus till his death.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And I heard the voice of a man between Ulai: and he called, and said: Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And he came and stood near where I stood: and when he was come, I fell on my face trembling, and he said to me: Understand, O son of man, for in the time of the end the vision shall be fulfilled.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And when he spoke to me I fell flat on the ground: and he touched me, and set me upright,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And he said to me: I will shew thee what things are to come to pass in the end of the malediction: for the time hath its end.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>The ram, which thou sawest with horns, is the king of the Medes and Persians.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And the he goat, is the king of the Greeks, and the great horn that was between his eyes, the same is the first king.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>But whereas when that was broken, there arose up four for it: four kings shall rise up of his nation, but not with his strength.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And after their reign, when iniquities shall be grown up, there shall arise a king of a shameless face, and understanding dark sentences.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And his power shall be strengthened, but not by his own force: and he shall lay all things waste, and shall prosper, and do more than can be believed. And he shall destroy the mighty, and the people of the saints,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>According to his will, and craft shall be successful in his hand: and his heart shall be puffed up, and in the abundance of all things he shall kill many: and he shall rise up against the prince of princes, and shall be broken without hand.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And the vision of the evening and the morning, which was told, is true: thou therefore seal up the vision, because it shall come to pass after many days.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=32&ch=8&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And I Daniel languished, and was sick for some days: and when I was risen up, I did the king's business, and I was astonished at the vision, and there was none that could interpret it.
