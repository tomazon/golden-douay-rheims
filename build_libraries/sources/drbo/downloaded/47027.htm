<p class=desc>The continuation of the history of the passion of Christ. His death and burial.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And when morning was come, all the chief priests and ancients of the people took counsel against Jesus, that they might put him to death.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And they brought him bound, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>Saying: I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said: What is that to us? look thou to it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed: and went and hanged himself with an halter.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the <u>corbona</u>, because it is the price of blood.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>For this cause the field was called Haceldama, that is, The field of blood, even to this day.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was prized, whom they prized of the children of Israel.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And they gave them unto the potter's field, as the Lord appointed to me.
</p>
<p class=note>
[6] <u>"Corbona"</u>: A place in the temple where the people put in their gifts or offerings.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus saith to him: Thou sayest it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And when he was accused by the chief priests and ancients, he answered nothing.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Then Pilate saith to him: Dost not thou hear how great testimonies they allege against thee?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And he answered him to never a word; so that the governor wondered exceedingly.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they would.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And he had then a notorious prisoner, that was called Barabbas.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said: Whom will you that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And as he was sitting in the place of judgment, his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people, that they should ask for Barabbas, and take Jesus away.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And the governor answering, said to them: Whether will you of the two to be released unto you? But they said, Barabbas.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>Pilate saith to them: What shall I do then with Jesus that is called Christ? They say all: Let him be crucified.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>The governor said to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying: Let him be crucified.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made; taking water washed his hands before the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; look you to it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And the whole people answering, said: His blood be upon us and our children.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him unto them to be crucified.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the hall, gathered together unto him the whole band;
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying: Hail, king of the Jews.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And spitting upon him, they took the reed, and struck his head.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they forced to take up his cross.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>And they sat and watched him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And they put over his head his cause written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>Then were crucified with him two thieves: one on the right hand, and one on the left.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days dost rebuild it: save thy own self: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking, said:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>He trusted in God; let him now deliver him if he will have him; for he said: I am the Son of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>And the selfsame thing the thieves also, that were crucified with him, reproached him with.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>And some that stood there and heard, said: This man calleth Elias.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=48-#x">&nbsp;48&nbsp;</a>And immediately one of them running took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar; and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=49-#x">&nbsp;49&nbsp;</a>And the others said: Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=50-#x">&nbsp;50&nbsp;</a>And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=51-#x">&nbsp;51&nbsp;</a>And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=52-#x">&nbsp;52&nbsp;</a>And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=53-#x">&nbsp;53&nbsp;</a>And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy city, and appeared to many.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=54-#x">&nbsp;54&nbsp;</a>Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the Son of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=55-#x">&nbsp;55&nbsp;</a>And there were there many women afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=56-#x">&nbsp;56&nbsp;</a>Among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=57-#x">&nbsp;57&nbsp;</a>And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=58-#x">&nbsp;58&nbsp;</a>He went to Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=59-#x">&nbsp;59&nbsp;</a>And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=60-#x">&nbsp;60&nbsp;</a>And laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument, and went his way.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=61-#x">&nbsp;61&nbsp;</a>And there was there Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=62-#x">&nbsp;62&nbsp;</a>And the next day, which followed <u>the day of preparation</u>, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=63-#x">&nbsp;63&nbsp;</a>Saying: Sir, we have remembered, that that seducer said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise again.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=64-#x">&nbsp;64&nbsp;</a>Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day: lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people: He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=65-#x">&nbsp;65&nbsp;</a>Pilate saith to them: You have a guard; go, guard it as you know.
</p>
<p class=note>
[62] <u>"The day of preparation"</u>: The eve of the sabbath; so called, because on that day they prepared all things necessary; not being allowed so much as to dress their meat on the sabbath day.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=27&l=66-#x">&nbsp;66&nbsp;</a>And they departing, made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting guards.
