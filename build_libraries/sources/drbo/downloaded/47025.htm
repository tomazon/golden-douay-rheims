<p class=desc>The parable of the ten virgins and of the talents. The description of the last judgment.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins, who taking their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And five of them were foolish, and five wise.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>But the five foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And the bridegroom tarrying, they all slumbered and slept.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And at midnight there was a cry made: Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>The wise answered, saying: Lest perhaps there be not enough for us and for you, go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>Now whilst they went to buy, the bridegroom came: and they that were ready, went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>But at last come also the other virgins, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>But he answering said: Amen I say to you, I know you not.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Watch ye therefore, because you know not the day nor the hour.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>For even as a man going into a far country, called his servants, and delivered to them his goods;
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper ability: and immediately he took his journey.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And he that had received the five talents, went his way, and traded with the same, and gained other five.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And in like manner he that had received the two, gained other two.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>But he that had received the one, going his way digged into the earth, and hid his lord's money.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>But after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reckoned with them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other five talents, saying: Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents, behold I have gained other five over and above.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And he also that had received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two talents to me: behold I have gained other two.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant: because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>But he that had received the one talent, came and said: Lord, I know that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou hast not sown, and gatherest where thou hast not strewed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And being afraid I went and hid thy talent in the earth: behold here thou hast that which is thine.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And his lord answering, said to him: Wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I have not strewed:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received my own with usury.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee; thirsty, and gave thee drink?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and covered thee?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>Or when did we see thee sick or in prison, and came to thee?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>And the king answering, shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you covered me not: sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=47&ch=25&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting.
