<p class=desc>Christ washes his disciples' feet. The treason of Judas. The new commandment of love.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a><u>Before the festival day of the pasch</u>, Jesus knowing that his hour was come, that he should pass out of this world to the Father: having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And when supper was done, (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,)
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came from God, and goeth to God;
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>He riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and having taken a towel, girded himself.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>After that, he putteth water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.
</p>
<p class=note>
[1] <u>"Before the festival day of the pasch"</u>: This was the fourth and last pasch of the ministry of Christ, and according to the common computation, was in the thirty-third year of our Lord: and in the year of the world 4036. Some chronologers are of opinion that our Saviour suffered in the thirty-seventh year of his age: but these different opinions on this subject are of no consequence.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>He cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And Peter saith to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered, and said to him: What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>Peter saith to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith to him: He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Then after he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you what I have done to you?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>You call me Master, and Lord; and you say well, for so I am.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>Amen, amen I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>If you know these things, you shall be blessed if you do them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth bread with me, shall lift up his heel against me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>At present I tell you, before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe that I am he.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Amen, amen I say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit; and he testified, and said: Amen, amen I say to you, one of you shall betray me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>He therefore, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him: Lord, who is it?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered: He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him: <u>That which thou dost, do quickly</u>.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy those things which we have need of for the festival day: or that he should give something to the poor.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>He therefore having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.
</p>
<p class=note>
[27] <u>"That which thou dost, do quickly"</u>: It is not a license, much less a command, to go about his treason: but a signification to him that Christ would not hinder or resist what he was about, do it as soon as he pleased: but was both ready and desirous to suffer for our redemption.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>When he therefore was gone out, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>If God be glorified in him, God also will glorify him in himself; and immediately will he glorify him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me; and as I said to the Jews: Whither I go you cannot come; so I say to you now.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow hereafter.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>Peter saith to him: Why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=13&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered him: Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Amen, amen I say to thee, the cock shall not crow, till thou deny me thrice.
