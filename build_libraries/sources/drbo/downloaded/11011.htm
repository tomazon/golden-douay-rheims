<p class=desc>Solomon by means of his wives falleth into idolatry: God raiseth him adversaries, Adad, Razon, and Jeroboam: Solomon dieth.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And king Solomon loved many strange women besides the daughter of Pharao, and women of Moab, and of Ammon, and of Edom, and of Sidon, and of the Hethites:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>Of the nations concerning which the Lord said to the children of Israel: You shall not go in unto them, neither shall any of them come in to yours: for they will most certainly turn away your heart to follow their gods. And to these was Solomon joined with a most ardent love.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And he had seven hundred wives as queens, and three hundred concubines: and the women turned away his heart.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And when he was now old, his heart was turned away by women to follow strange gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>But Solomon worshipped Astarthe the goddess of the Sidonians, and Moloch the idol of the ammonites.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And Solomon did that which was not pleasing before the Lord, and did not fully follow the Lord, as David his father.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>Then Solomon built a temple for Chamos the idol of Moab, on the hill that is over against Jerusalem, and for Moloch the idol of the children of Ammon.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And he did in this manner for all his wives that were strangers, who burnt incense, and offered sacrifice to their gods.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his mind was turned away from the Lord the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not follow strange gods: but he kept not the things which the Lord commanded him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>The Lord therefore said to Solomon: Because thou hast done this, and hast not kept my covenant, and my precepts, which I have commanded thee, I will divide and rend thy kingdom, and will give it to thy servant.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Nevertheless in thy days I will not do it, for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Neither will I take away the whole kingdom, but I will give <u>one tribe</u> to thy son for the sake of David my servant, and Jerusalem which I have chosen.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And the Lord raised up an adversary to Solomon, Adad the Edomite of the king's seed, in Edom.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>For when David was in Edom, and Joab the general of the army was gone up to bury them that were slain, and had killed every male in Edom,
</p>
<p class=note>
[13] <u>"One tribe"</u>: Besides that of Juda, his own native tribe.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>(For Joab remained there six months with all Israel, till he had slain every male in Edom,)
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Then Adad fled, he and certain Edomites, of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt: and Adad was then a little boy.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And they arose out of Madian, and came into Pharan, and they took men with them from Pharan, and went into Egypt to Pharao the king of Egypt: who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and assigned him land.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And Adad found great favour before Pharao, insomuch that he gave him to wife, the own sister of his wife Taphnes the queen.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And the sister of Taphnes bore him his son Genubath, and Taphnes brought him up in the house of Pharao: and Genubath dwelt with Pharao among his children.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And when Adad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the general of the army was dead, he said to Pharao: Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And Pharao said to him: Why, what is wanting to thee with me, that thou seekest to go to thy own country? But he answered: Nothing: yet I beseech thee to let me go.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>God also raised up against him an adversary, Razon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master Adarezer the king of Soba:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And he gathered men against him, and he became a captain of robbers, when David slew them of Soba: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt there, and they made him king in Damascus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And he was an adversary to Israel, all the days of Solomon: and this is the evil of Adad, and his hatred against Israel, and he reigned in Syria.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>Jeroboam also the son of Nabat an Ephrathite of Sareda, a servant of Solomon, whose mother was named Sarua, a widow woman, lifted up his hand against the king.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And this is the cause of his rebellion against him, for Solomon built Mello, and filled up the breach of the city of David his father.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And Jeroboam was a valiant and mighty man: and Solomon seeing him a young man ingenious and industrious, made him chief over the tributes of all the house of Joseph.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>So it came to pass at that time, that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahias the Silonite, clad with a new garment, found him in the way: and they two were alone in the field.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And Ahias taking his new garment, wherewith he was clad, divided it into twelve parts:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>And he said to Jeroboam: Take to thee ten pieces: for thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Behold I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give thee ten tribes.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>But one tribe shall remain to him for the sake of my servant David, and Jerusalem the city, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>Because he hath forsaken me, and hath adored Astarthe the goddess of the Sidonians, and Chamos the god of Moab, and Moloch the god of the children of Ammon: and hath not walked in my ways, to do justice before me, and to keep my precepts, and judgments as did David his father.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>Yet I will not take away all the kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my precepts.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>But I will take away the kingdom out of his son's hand and will give thee ten tribes:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>And to his son I will give one tribe, that there may remain a lamp for my servant David before me always in Jerusalem the city which I have chosen, that my name might be there.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign over all that thy soul desireth, and thou shalt be king over Israel.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>If then thou wilt hearken to all that I shall command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do what is right before me, keeping my commandments and my precepts, as David my servant did: I will be with thee, and will build thee up a faithful house, as I built a house for David, and I will deliver Israel to thee:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but yet not for ever.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam: but he arose, and fled into Egypt to Sesac the king of Egypt, and was in Egypt till the death of Solomon.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>And the rest of the words of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom: behold they are all written in <u>the book of the words</u> of the days of Solomon.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>And the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel, were forty years.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=11&ch=11&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>And <u>Solomon slept</u> with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father, and Roboam his son reigned in his stead.
<p class=note>
[41] <u>"The book of the words"</u>: This book is lost, with divers others mentioned in holy writ.
</p>
<p class=note>
[43] <u>"Solomon slept"</u>: That is, died. He was then about fifty-eight years of age, having reigned forty years.
