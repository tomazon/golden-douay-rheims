<p class=desc>The vanity of pleasures, riches, and worldly labours.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>I said in my heart: I will go, and abound with delights, and enjoy good things. And I saw that this also was vanity.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>Laughter I counted error: and to mirth I said: Why art thou vainly deceived?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind to wisdom, and might avoid folly, till I might see what was profitable for the children of men: and what they ought to do under the sun, all the days of their life.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>I made me great works, I built me houses, and planted vineyards,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>I made gardens, and orchards, and set them with trees of all kinds,
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood of the young trees,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>I got me menservants, and maidservants, and had a great family: and herds of oxen, and great flocks of sheep, above all that were before me in Jerusalem:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>I heaped together for myself silver and gold, and the wealth of kings, and provinces: I made me singing men, and singing women, and the delights of the sons of men, cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And I surpassed in riches all that were before me in Jerusalem: my wisdom also remained with me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And whatsoever my eyes desired, I refused them not: and I withheld not my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and delighting itself in the things which I had prepared: and esteemed this my portion, to make use of my own labour.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had wrought, and to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain, I saw in all things vanity, and vexation of mind, and that nothing was lasting under the sun.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>I passed further to behold wisdom, and errors and folly, (What is man, said I, that he can follow the King his maker?)
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And I saw that wisdom excelled folly, as much as light differeth from darkness.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>The eyes of a wise man are in his head: the fool walketh in darkness: and I learned that they were to die both alike.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And I said in my heart: If the death of the fool and mine shall be one, what doth it avail me, that I have applied myself more to the study of wisdom? And speaking with my own mind, I perceived that this also was vanity.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>For there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than of the fool for ever, and the times to come shall cover all things together with oblivion: the learned dieth in like manner as the unlearned.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And therefore I was weary of my life, when I saw that all things under the sun are evil, and all vanity and vexation of spirit.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>Again I hated all my application wherewith I had earnestly laboured under the sun, being like to have an heir after me,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>Whom I know not whether he will be a wise man or a fool, and he shall have rule over all my labours with which I have laboured and been solicitous: and is there any thing so vain?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Wherefore I left off and my heart renounced labouring any more under the sun.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>For when a man laboureth in wisdom, and knowledge, and carefulness, he leaveth what he hath gotten to an idle man: so this also is vanity, and a great evil.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>For what profit shall a man have of all his labour, and vexation of spirit, with which he hath been tormented under the sun?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>All his days are full of sorrows and miseries, even in the night he doth not rest in mind: and is not this vanity?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Is it not better to eat and drink, and to shew his soul good things of his labours? and this is from the hand of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>Who shall so feast and abound with delights as I?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=23&ch=2&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>God hath given to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he hath given vexation, and superfluous care, to heap up and to gather together, and to give it to him that hath pleased God: but this also is vanity, and a fruitless solicitude of the mind.
