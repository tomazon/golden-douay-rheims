<p class=desc>Moses is empowered to confirm his mission with miracles: his brother Aaron is appointed to assist him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Moses answered and said: They will not believe me, nor hear my voice, but they will say: The Lord hath not appeared to thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>Then he said to him: What is that thou holdest in thy hand? He answered: A rod.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And the Lord said: Cast it down upon the ground. He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent: so that Moses fled from it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And the Lord said: Put out thy hand and take it by the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>That they may believe, saith he, that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And the Lord said again: Put thy hand into thy bosom. And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth leprous as snow.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And he said: Put back thy hand into thy bosom. He put it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other flesh.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>If they will not believe thee, saith he, nor hear the voice of the former sign, they will believe the word of the latter sign.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>But if they will not even believe these two signs, nor hear thy voice: take of the river water, and pour it out upon the dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river shall be turned into blood.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>Moses said: I beseech thee, Lord. I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before: and since thou hast spoken to thy servant, I have more impediment and slowness of tongue.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>The Lord said to him: Who made man's mouth? or who made the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind? did not I?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Go therefore and I will be in thy mouth: and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>But he said: I beseech thee, Lord send whom thou wilt send.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>The Lord being angry at Moses, said Aaron the Levite is thy brother, I know that he is eloquent: behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and seeing thee shall be glad at heart.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Speak to him, and put my words in his mouth: and I will be in thy mouth, and in his mouth, and will shew you what you must do.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>He shall speak in thy stead to the people, and shall be thy mouth: but thou shalt be to him in those things that pertain to God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And take this rod in thy hand, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>Moses went his way, and returned to Jethro his father in law and said to him: I will go and return to my brethren into Egypt, that I may see if they be yet alive. And Jethro said to him: Go in peace.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And the Lord said to Moses, in Madian: Go, and return into Egypt: for they are all dead that sought thy life.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Moses therefore took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass: and returned into Egypt, carrying the rod of God in his hand.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And the Lord said to him as he was returning into Egypt: See that thou do all the wonders before Pharao, which I have put in thy hand: <u>I shall harden</u> his heart, and he will not let the people go.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Israel is my son, my firstborn.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>I have said to thee: Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou wouldst not let him go: behold I will kill thy son, thy firstborn.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And when he was in his journey, in the inn, <u>the Lord met him, and would have killed him</u>.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>Immediately Sephora took a very sharp stone, and circumcised the fore skin of her son, and touched his feet and said: A bloody spouse art thou to me.
</p>
<p class=note>
[21] <u>"I shall harden"</u>: Not by being the efficient cause of his sin; but by withdrawing from him, for his just punishment, the dew of grace that might have softened his heart; and so suffering him to grow harder and harder.
</p>
<p class=note>
[24] <u>"The Lord met him, and would have killed him"</u>: This was an angel representing the Lord, who treated Moses in this manner, for having neglected the circumcision of his younger son; which his wife understanding, circumcised her child upon the spot, upon which the angel let Moses go.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And he let him go after she had said A bloody spouse art thou to me, because of the circumcision.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And the Lord said to Aaron: Go into the desert to meet Moses. And he went forth to meet him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord, by which he had sent him, and the signs that he had commanded.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And they came together, and they assembled all the ancients of the children of Israel.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had said to Moses: and he wrought the signs before the people,
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=2&ch=4&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>And the people believed. And they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel: and that he had looked upon their affliction: and falling down they adored.
