<p class=desc>The parables of the lost sheep and of the prodigal son.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Now the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying: This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And he spoke to them this parable, saying:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>What man of you that hath an hundred sheep: and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that which was lost, until he find it?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>Or what woman having ten groats; if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>So I say to you, there shall be joy <u>before the angels</u> of God upon one sinner doing penance.
</p>
<p class=note>
[10] <u>"Before the angels"</u>: By this it is plain that the spirits in heaven have a concern for us below, and a joy at our repentance and consequently a knowledge of it.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And he said: A certain man had two sons:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And the younger of them said to his father: Father, give me the portion of substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his substance.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father's house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>I will arise, and will go to my father, and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And rising up he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and running to him fell upon his neck, and kissed him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And the son said to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, I am not now worthy to be called thy son.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and make merry:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Because this my son was dead, and is come to life again: was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>Now his elder son was in the field, and when he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And he said to him: Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And he was angry, and would not go in. His father therefore coming out began to entreat him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is thine.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=15&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.
