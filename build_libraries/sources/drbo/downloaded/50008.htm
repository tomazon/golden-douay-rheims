<p class=desc>The woman taken in adultery. Christ justifies his doctrine.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And Jesus went unto mount Olivet.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him, and sitting down he taught them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And said to him: Master, this woman was even now taken in adultery.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one. But what sayest thou?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned thee?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Again therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying: I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou givest testimony of thyself: thy testimony is not true.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered, and said to them: Although I give testimony of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but you know not whence I come, or whither I go.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>You judge according to the flesh: I judge not any man.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And if I do judge, my judgment is true: because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And in your law it is written, that the testimony of two men is true.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>I am one that give testimony of myself: and the Father that sent me giveth testimony of me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>They said therefore to him: Where is thy Father? Jesus answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father: if you did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>Again therefore Jesus said to them: I go, and you shall seek me, and you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you cannot come.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore said: Will he kill himself, because he said: Whither I go, you cannot come?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above. You are of this world, I am not of this world.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>They said therefore to him: Who art thou? Jesus said to them: The beginning, who also speak unto you.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>Many things I have to speak and to judge of you. But he that sent me, is true: and the things I have heard of him, these same I speak in the world.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And they understood not, that he called God his Father.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore said to them: When you shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know, that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father hath taught me, these things I speak:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And he that sent me, is with me, and he hath not left me alone: for I do always the things that please him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>When he spoke these things, many believed in him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus said to those Jews, who believed him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>They answered him: We are the seed of Abraham, and we have never been slaves to any man: how sayest thou: you shall be free?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them: Amen, amen I say unto you: that whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever; but the son abideth for ever.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>I know that you are the children of Abraham: but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do the things that you have seen with your father.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>They answered, and said to him: Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them: If you be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken the truth to you, which I have heard of God. This Abraham did not.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>You do the works of your father. They said therefore to him: We are not born of fornication: we have one Father, even God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore said to them: If God were your Father, you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded, and came; for I came not of myself, but he sent me:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>Why do you not know my speech? Because you cannot hear my word.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>But if I say the truth, you believe me not.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>Which of you shall convict me of sin? If I say the truth to you, why do you not believe me?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>He that is of God, heareth the words of God. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=48-#x">&nbsp;48&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore answered, and said to him: Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=49-#x">&nbsp;49&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered: I have not a devil: but I honour my Father, and you have dishonoured me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=50-#x">&nbsp;50&nbsp;</a>But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=51-#x">&nbsp;51&nbsp;</a>Amen, amen I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=52-#x">&nbsp;52&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore said: Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest: If any man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=53-#x">&nbsp;53&nbsp;</a>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=54-#x">&nbsp;54&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered: If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom you say that he is your God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=55-#x">&nbsp;55&nbsp;</a>And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar. But I do know him, and do keep his word.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=56-#x">&nbsp;56&nbsp;</a>Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day: he saw it, and was glad.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=57-#x">&nbsp;57&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=58-#x">&nbsp;58&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to you, before Abraham was made, I am.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=8&l=59-#x">&nbsp;59&nbsp;</a>They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.
