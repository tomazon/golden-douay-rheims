<p class=desc>Philip converts the Samaritans and baptizes the eunuch.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And at that time there was raised a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed through the countries of Judea, and Samaria, except the apostles.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And devout men took order for Stephen's funeral, and made great mourning over him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>But Saul made havock of the church, entering in from house to house, and dragging away men and women, committed them to prison.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>They therefore that were dispersed, went about preaching the word of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And Philip going down to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And the people with one accord were attentive to those things which were said by Philip, hearing, and seeing the miracles which he did.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>For many of them who had unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, went out.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And many, taken with the palsy, and that were lame, were healed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>There was therefore great joy in that city. Now there was a certain man named Simon, who before had been a magician in that city, seducing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the power of God, which is called great.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And they were attentive to him, because, for a long time, he had bewitched them with his magical practices.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>But when they had believed Philip preaching of the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Then Simon himself believed also; and being baptized, he adhered to Philip. And being astonished, wondered to see the signs and exceeding great miracles which were done.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Who, when they were come, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>For he was not as yet come upon any of them; but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Then <u>they laid their hands upon them</u>, and they received the Holy Ghost.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And when Simon saw, that by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>Saying: Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I shall lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter said to him:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
</p>
<p class=note>
[17] <u>"They laid their hands upon them"</u>: The apostles administered the sacrament of confirmation, by imposition of hands, and prayer; and the faithful thereby received the Holy Ghost. Not but they had received the grace of the Holy Ghost at their baptism: yet not that plenitude of grace and those spiritual gifts which they afterwards received from bishops in the sacrament of confirmation, which strengthened them to profess their faith publicly.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter. For thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>Do penance therefore for this thy wickedness; and pray to God, that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Then Simon answering, said: Pray you for me to the Lord, that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And they indeed having testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many countries of the Samaritans.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And rising up, he went. And behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And he was returning, sitting in his chariot, and reading Isaias the prophet.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>Who said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>In humility his judgment was taken away. His generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>And the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? of himself, or of some other man?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>Then Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water; and the eunuch said: See, here is water: what doth hinder me from being baptized?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And Philip said: <u>If thou believest with all thy heart</u>, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he baptized him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=8&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>But Philip was found in Azotus; and passing through, he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
<p class=note>
[37] <u>"If thou believest with all thy heart"</u>: The scripture many times mentions only one disposition, as here belief, when others equally necessary are not expressed, viz., a sorrow for sins, a firm hope, and the love of God. Moreover, believing with the whole heart signifies a belief of every thing necessary for salvation.
