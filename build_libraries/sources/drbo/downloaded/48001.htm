<p class=desc>The preaching of John the Baptist. Christ is baptized by him. He calls his disciples and works many miracles.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>As it is written in Isaias the prophet: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>A voice of one crying in the desert: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>John was in the desert baptizing, and preaching the baptism of penance, unto remission of sins.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And he preached, saying: There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>I have baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And forthwith coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit as a dove descending, and remaining on him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And there came a voice from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan; and he was with beasts, and the angels ministered to him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And saying: The time is accomplished, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea (for they were fishermen).
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said to them: Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And they entered into Capharnaum, and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And Jesus threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and go out of the man.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And the unclean spirit tearing him, and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? what is this new doctrine? for with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And Simon's wife's mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And all the city was gathered together at the door.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases; and he cast out many devils, and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>And he was preaching in their synagogues, and in all Galilee, and casting out devils.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down said to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>And Jesus having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand; and touching him, saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=1&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in desert places: and they flocked to him from all sides.
