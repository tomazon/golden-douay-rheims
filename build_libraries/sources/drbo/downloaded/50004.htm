<p class=desc>Christ talks with the Samaritan woman. He heals the ruler's son.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>When Jesus therefore understood that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus maketh more disciples, and baptizeth more than John,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>(Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>He left Judea, and went again into Galilee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou, being a Jew, ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep; from whence then hast thou living water?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered, and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>But the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>The woman saith to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>The woman answered, and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well, I have no husband:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Our fathers adored on <u>this mountain</u>, and you say, that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore.
</p>
<p class=note>
[20] <u>"This mountain"</u>: Garizim, where the Samaritans had their schismatical temple.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me, that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, adore the Father.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we know; for salvation is of the Jews.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>God is a spirit; and they that adore him, must adore him in spirit and in truth.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh (who is called Christ). Therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And immediately his disciples came; and they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>The woman therefore left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men there:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>They went therefore out of the city, and came unto him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>In the mean time the disciples prayed him, saying: Rabbi, eat.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>But he said to them: I have meat to eat, which you know not.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>The disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him to eat?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries; for they are white already to harvest.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>For in this is the saying true: That it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour: others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him, for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me all things whatsoever I have done.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>And many more believed in him because of his own word.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>And they said to the woman: We now believe, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>Now after two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day; for they also went to the festival day.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capharnaum.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and prayed him to come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=48-#x">&nbsp;48&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=49-#x">&nbsp;49&nbsp;</a>The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=50-#x">&nbsp;50&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith to him: Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=51-#x">&nbsp;51&nbsp;</a>And as he was going down, his servants met him; and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=52-#x">&nbsp;52&nbsp;</a>He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=53-#x">&nbsp;53&nbsp;</a>The father therefore knew, that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and his whole house.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=4&l=54-#x">&nbsp;54&nbsp;</a>This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee.
