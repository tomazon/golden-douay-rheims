<p class=desc>David's sin in numbering the people is punished by a pestilence: which ceaseth upon his offering sacrifice in the thrashingfloor of Ornan.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And Satan rose up against Israel: and moved David to number Israel.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And David said to Joab, and to the rulers of the people: Go, and number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and bring me the number of them that I may know it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And Joab answered: The Lord make his people a hundred times more than they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all thy servants: why doth my lord seek this thing, which may be imputed as a sin to Israel?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>But the king's word rather prevailed: and Joab departed, and went through all Israel: and returned to Jerusalem.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And he gave David <u>the number</u> of them, whom he had surveyed: and all the number of Israel was found to be eleven hundred thousand men that drew the sword: and of Juda four hundred and seventy thousand fighting men.
</p>
<p class=note>
[5] <u>"The number"</u>: The difference of the numbers here and 2 Kings 24. is to be accounted for, by supposing the greater number to be that which was really found, and the lesser to be that which Joab gave in.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>But Levi and Benjamin he did not number: for Joab unwillingly executed the king's orders.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And God was displeased with this thing that was commanded: and he struck Israel.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And David said to God: I have sinned exceedingly in doing this: I beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done foolishly.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer of David, saying:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>Go, and speak to David, and tell him: Thus saith the Lord: I give thee the choice of three things: choose one which thou wilt, and I will do it to thee.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And when Gad was come to David, he said to him: Thus saith the Lord: choose which thou wilt:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Either <u>three years' famine</u>: or three months to flee from thy enemies, and not to be able to escape their sword: or three days to have the sword of the Lord, and pestilence in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying in all the coasts of Israel: now therefore see what I shall answer him who sent me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And David said to Gad: I am on every side in a great strait: but it is better for me to fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of men.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel. And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to strike it: and as he was striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for the greatness of the evil: and said to the angel that destroyed: It is enough, now stop thy hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the thrashing floor of <u>Ornan</u> the Jebusite.
</p>
<p class=note>
[12] <u>"Three years famine"</u>: Which joined with the three foregoing years of famine mentioned, 2 Kings 21. and the seventh year of the land's resting, would make up the seven years proposed by the prophet, 2 Kings 24. 13.
</p>
<p class=note>
[15] <u>"Ornan"</u>: Otherwise Areuna.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And David lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against Jerusalem: and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the ground.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And David said to God: Am not I he that commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned: it is I that have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O Lord my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father's house: and let not thy people be destroyed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David, to go up, and build an altar to the Lord God in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the angel, he and his four sons hid themselves: for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and went out of the threshingfloor to meet him, and bowed down to him with his face to the ground.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And David said to him: Give me this place of thy threshingfloor, that I may build therein an altar to the Lord: but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And Ornan said to David: Take it, and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen also I give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the sacrifice: I will give it all willingly.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And king David said to him: It shall not be so, but I will give thee money as much as it is worth: for I must not take it from thee, and so offer to the Lord holocausts free cost.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>So David gave to Ornan for the place, <u>six hundred sicles</u> of gold of just weight.
</p>
<p class=note>
[25] <u>"Six hundred sicles"</u>: This was the price of the whole place, on which the temple was afterwards built; but the price of the oxen was fifty sicles of silver. 2 Kings 24. 24.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And he built there an altar to the Lord: and he offered holocausts, and peace offerings, and he called upon the Lord, and he heard him by sending fire from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And the Lord commanded the angel: and he put up his sword again into the sheath.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And David seeing that the Lord had heard him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims there.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of holocausts, was at that time in the high place of Gabaon.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=13&ch=21&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And David could not go to the altar there to pray to God: for he was seized with an exceeding great fear, seeing the sword of the angel of the Lord.
