<p class=desc>Zacheus entertains Christ. The parable of the pounds. Christ rides upon an ass and weeps over Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And entering in, he walked through Jericho.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And behold, there was a man named Zacheus, who was the chief of the publicans, and he was rich.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And he sought to see Jesus who he was, and he could not for the crowd, because he was low of stature.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And running before, he climbed up into a sycamore tree, that he might see him; for he was to pass that way.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And when Jesus was come to the place, looking up, he saw him, and said to him: Zacheus, make haste and come down; for this day I must abide in thy house.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And he made haste and came down; and received him with joy.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And when all saw it, they murmured, saying, that he was gone to be a guest with a man that was a sinner.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>But Zacheus standing, said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man of any thing, I restore him fourfold.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>As they were hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately be manifested.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>He said therefore: A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And calling his ten servants, <u>he gave them ten pounds</u>, and said to them: Trade till I come.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>But his citizens hated him: and they sent an embassage after him, saying: We will not have this man to reign over us.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that he returned, having received the kingdom: and he commanded his servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.
</p>
<p class=note>
[13] <u>"He gave them ten pounds"</u>: In the original, what is here translated a pound, is in Latin, mina, in value of our coin, three pounds two shillings and sixpence.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And the first came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And he said to him: Well done, thou good servant, because thou hast been faithful in a little, thou shalt have power over ten cities.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And the second came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And he said to him: Be thou also over five cities.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And another came, saying: Lord, behold here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin;
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and thou reapest that which thou didst not sow.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>He saith to him: Out of thy own mouth I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming, I might have exacted it with usury?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And he said to them that stood by: Take the pound away from him, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And they said to him: Lord, he hath ten pounds.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>But I say to you, that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: and from him that hath not, even that which he hath, shall be taken from him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them hither, and kill them before me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethania, unto the mount called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>Saying: Go into the town which is over against you, at your entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied, on which no man ever hath sitten: loose him, and bring him hither.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>And if any man shall ask you: Why do you loose him? you shall say thus unto him: Because the Lord hath need of his service.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And they that were sent, went their way, and found the colt standing, as he had said unto them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them: Why loose you the colt?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>But they said: Because the Lord hath need of him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>And they brought him to Jesus. And casting their garments on the colt, they set Jesus thereon.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>And as he went, they spread their clothes underneath in the way.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And when he was now coming near the descent of mount Olivet, the whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works they had seen,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>Saying: Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory on high!
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>And some of the Pharisees, from amongst the multitude, said to him: Master, rebuke thy disciples.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>To whom he said: I say to you, that if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace; but now they are hidden from thy eyes.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>For the days shall come upon thee, and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and straiten thee on every side,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee: and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>And he was teaching daily in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=19&l=48-#x">&nbsp;48&nbsp;</a>And they found not what to do to him: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
