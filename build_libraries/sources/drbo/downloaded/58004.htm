<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=58&ch=4&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And say to Archippus: Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=58&ch=4&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>The salutation of Paul with my own hand. Be mindful of my bands. Grace be with you. Amen.
<p class=note>
[16] <u>"Read that which is of the Laodiceans"</u>: What this epistle was, is uncertain, and annotators have given different opinions concerning it. Some expound these words of an epistle which St. Paul wrote to the Laodiceans, and is since lost, for that now extant is no more than a collection of sentences out of the other epistles of St. Paul; therefore it cannot be considered even as a part of that epistle. Others explain that the text means a letter sent to St. Paul by the Laodiceans, which he sends to the Colossians to be read by them. However, this opinion does not seem well founded. Hence it is more probable that St. Paul wrote an epistle from Rome to the Laodiceans, about the same time that he wrote to the Colossians, as he had them both equally at heart, and that he ordered that epistle to be read by the Colossians for their instructions; and being neighbouring cities, they might communicate to each other what they had received from him; as one epistle might contain some matters not related in the other, and would be equally useful for their concern; and more particularly as they were equally disturbed by intruders and false teachers, against which the apostle was anxious to warn them, lest they should be infected by their pernicious doctrine.
