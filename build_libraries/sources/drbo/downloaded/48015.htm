<p class=desc>The continuation of the history of the passion.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And straightway in the morning, the chief priests holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And the chief priests accused him in many things.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? behold in how many things they accuse thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done unto them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And Pilate answered them, and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>But they again cried out: Crucify him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they called together the whole band:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own garments on him, and they led him out to crucify him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And it was <u>the third hour</u>, and they crucified him.
</p>
<p class=note>
[25] <u>"The third hour"</u>: The ancient account divided the day into four parts, which were named from the hour from which they began; the first, third, sixth, and ninth hour. Our Lord was crucified a little before noon; before the third hour had quite expired; but when the sixth hour was near at hand.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days buildest it up again;
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>Save thyself, coming down from the cross.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>In like manner also the chief priests mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost, said: Indeed this man was the son of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joseph, and Salome:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>Who also when he was in Galilee followed him, and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>And when evening was now come, (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath,)
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>And Joseph buying fine linen, and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=15&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>And Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid.
