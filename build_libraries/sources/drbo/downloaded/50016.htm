<p class=desc>The conclusion of Christ's last discourse to his disciples.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>These things have I spoken to you, that you may not be scandalized.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>They will put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth a service to God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And these things will they do to you; because they have not known the Father, nor me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>But these things I have told you, that when the hour shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>But I told you not these things from the beginning, because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And when he is come, <u>he will convict the world of sin</u>, and of justice, and of judgment.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>Of sin: because they believed not in me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And of justice: because I go to the Father; and you shall see me no longer.
</p>
<p class=note>
[8] <u>"He will convict the world of sin"</u>: The Holy Ghost, by his coming brought over many thousands, first, to a sense of their sin in not believing in Christ. Secondly, to a conviction of the justice of Christ, now sitting at the right hand of his Father. And thirdly, to a right apprehension of the judgment prepared for them that choose to follow Satan, who is already judged and condemned.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And of judgment: because the prince of this world is already judged.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he <u>will teach you all truth</u>. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it to you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine. Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shew it to you.
</p>
<p class=note>
[13] <u>"Will teach you all truth"</u>: See the annotation on chap. 14. ver. 26.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>A little while, and now you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the Father.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Then some of the disciples said one to another: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me, and, because I go to the Father?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little while? we know not what he speaketh.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him; and he said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, because I said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Amen, amen I say to you, that you shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be made sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>A woman, when she is in labour, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>So also you now indeed have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man shall take from you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and I go to the Father.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>Now we know that thou knowest all things, and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=16&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have confidence, I have overcome the world.
