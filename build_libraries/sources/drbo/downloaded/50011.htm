<p class=desc>Christ raises Lazarus to life. The rulers resolve to put him to death.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Now there was a certain man sick, named Lazarus, of Bethania, of the town of Mary and Martha her sister.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>(And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair: whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>His sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God may be glorified by it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still remained in the same place two days.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>Then after that, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>The disciples say to him: Rabbi, the Jews but now sought to stone thee: and goest thou thither again?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours of the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>These things he said; and after that he said to them: Lazarus our friend sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>His disciples therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, that you may believe: but let us go to him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been four days already in the grave.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>(Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus had come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall rise again.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Martha saith to him: I know that he shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Christ the Son of the living God, who art come into this world.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And when she had said these things, she went, and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come, and calleth for thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly, and cometh to him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>For Jesus was not yet come into the town: but he was still in that place where Martha had met him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep there.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and saith to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were come with her, weeping, groaned in the spirit, and troubled himself,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>And Jesus wept.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>But some of them said: Could not he that opened the eyes of the man born blind, have caused that this man should not die?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre. Now it was a cave; and a stone was laid over it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four days.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to thee, that if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifting up his eyes said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and Martha, and had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them the things that Jesus had done.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=48-#x">&nbsp;48&nbsp;</a>If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=49-#x">&nbsp;49&nbsp;</a>But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=50-#x">&nbsp;50&nbsp;</a>Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=51-#x">&nbsp;51&nbsp;</a>And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=52-#x">&nbsp;52&nbsp;</a>And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=53-#x">&nbsp;53&nbsp;</a>From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=54-#x">&nbsp;54&nbsp;</a>Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=55-#x">&nbsp;55&nbsp;</a>And the pasch of the Jews was at hand; and many from the country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to purify themselves.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=11&l=56-#x">&nbsp;56&nbsp;</a>They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one with another, standing in the temple: What think you that he is not come to the festival day? And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him.
