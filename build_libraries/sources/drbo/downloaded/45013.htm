<p class=desc>Simon is made captain general in the room of his brother. Jonathan is slain by Tryphon. Simon is favoured by Demetrius: he taketh Gaza, and the castle of Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Now Simon heard that Tryphon was gathering together a very great army, to invade the land of Juda, and to destroy it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And seeing that the people was in dread, and in fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and assembled the people:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And exhorted them, saying: You know what great battles I and my brethren, and the house of my father, have fought for the laws, and the sanctuary, and the distresses that we have seen:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>By reason whereof all my brethren have lost their lives for Israel's sake, and I am left alone.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And now far be it from me to spare my life in any time of trouble: for I am not better than my brethren.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>I will avenge then my nation and the sanctuary, and our children, and wives: for all the heathens are gathered together to destroy us out of mere malice.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And the spirit of the people was enkindled as soon as they heard these words.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And they answered with a loud voice, saying: Thou art our leader in the place of Judas, and Jonathan thy brother.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>Fight thou our battles, and we will do whatsoever thou shalt say to us.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>So gathering together all the men of war, he made haste to finish all the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it round about.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And he sent Jonathan the son of Absalom, and with him a new army into Joppe, and he cast out them that were in it, and himself remained there.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And Tryphon removed from Ptolemais with a great army, to invade the land of Juda, and Jonathan was with him in custody.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>But Simon pitched in Addus, over against the plain.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And when Tryphon understood that Simon was risen up in the place of his brother Jonathan, and that he meant to join battle with him, he sent messengers to him,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Saying: We have detained thy brother Jonathan for the money that he owed in the king's account, by reason of the affairs which he had the management of.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>But now send a hundred talents of silver, and his two sons for hostages, that when he is set at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will release him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Now Simon knew that he spoke deceitfully to him, nevertheless he ordered the money, and the children to be sent: lest he should bring upon himself a great hatred of the people of Israel, who might have said:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>Because he sent not the money, and the children, therefore is he lost.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>So he sent the children, and the hundred talents: and he lied, and did not let Jonathan go.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And after this Tryphon entered within the country, to destroy it: and they went about by the way that leadeth to Ador: and Simon and his army marched to every place <u>whithersoever they went</u>.
</p>
<p class=note>
[20] <u>"Whithersoever they went"</u>: That is, whithersoever Tryphon and his horsemen went in order to oppose them.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And they that were in the castle, sent messengers to Tryphon, that he should make haste to come through the desert, and send them victuals.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come that night: but there fell a very great snow, and he came not into the country of Galaad.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And when he approached to Bascama, he slew Jonathan and his sons there.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And Tryphon returned, and went into his own country.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And Simon sent, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried them in Modin, in the city of his fathers.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And all Israel bewailed him with great lamentation: and they mourned for him many days.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And Simon built over the sepulchre of his father and of his brethren, a building lofty to the sight, of polished stone behind and before:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And he set up seven pyramids one against another for his father and his mother, and his four brethren:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And round about these he set great pillars: and upon the pillars arms for a perpetual memory: and by the arms ships carved, which might be seen by all that sailed on the sea.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>This is the sepulchre that he made in Modin even unto this day.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>But Tryphon when he was upon a journey with the young king Antiochus, treacherously slew him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And he reigned in his place, and put on the crown of Asia: and brought great evils upon the land.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And Simon built up the strong holds of Judea, fortifying them with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and bars: and he stored up victuals in the fortresses.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>And Simon chose men and sent to king Demetrius, to the end that he should grant an immunity to the land: for all that Tryphon did was to spoil.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>And king Demetrius in answer to this request, wrote a letter in this manner:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>King Demetrius to Simon the high priest, and friend of kings, and to the ancients, and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>The golden crown, and the palm, which you sent, we have received: and we are ready to make a firm peace with you, and to write to the king's chief officers to release you the things that we have released.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>For all that we have decreed in your favour, shall stand in force. The strong holds that you have built, shall be your own.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>And as for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, we forgive it, and the crown which you owed: and if any other thing were taxed in Jerusalem, now let it not be taxed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>And if any of you be fit to be enrolled among ours, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>In the year one hundred and seventy the yoke of the Gentiles was taken off from Israel.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>And the people of Israel began to write in the instruments, and public records, The first year under Simon the high priest, the great captain and prince of the Jews.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>In those days Simon besieged Gaza, and camped round about it, and he made engines, and set them to the city, and he struck one tower, and took it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>And they that were within the engine leaped into the city: and there was a great uproar in the city.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>And they that were in the city went up with their wives and children upon the wall, with their garments rent, and they cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>And they said: Deal not with us according to our evil deeds, but according to thy mercy.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>And Simon being moved, did not destroy them: but yet he cast them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein there had been idols, and then he entered into it with hymns, blessing the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=48-#x">&nbsp;48&nbsp;</a>And having cast out of it all uncleanness, he placed in it men that should observe the law: and he fortified it, and made it his habitation.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=49-#x">&nbsp;49&nbsp;</a>But they that were in the castle of Jerusalem were hindered from going out and coming into the country, and from buying and selling: and they were straitened with hunger, and many of them perished through famine.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=50-#x">&nbsp;50&nbsp;</a>And they cried to Simon for peace, and he granted it to them: and he cast them out from thence, and cleansed the castle from uncleannesses.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=51-#x">&nbsp;51&nbsp;</a>And they entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month, in the year one hundred and seventy-one, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and harps, and cymbals, and psalteries, and hymns, and canticles, because the great enemy was destroyed out of Israel.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=52-#x">&nbsp;52&nbsp;</a>And he ordained that these days should be kept every year with gladness.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=53-#x">&nbsp;53&nbsp;</a>And he fortified the mountain of the temple that was near the castle, and he dwelt there himself, and they that were with him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=45&ch=13&l=54-#x">&nbsp;54&nbsp;</a>And Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man for war: and he made him captain of all the forces: and he dwelt in Gazara.
