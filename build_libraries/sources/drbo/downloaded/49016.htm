<p class=desc>The parable of the unjust steward and of the rich man and Lazarus.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And he said also to his disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a steward: and the same was accused unto him, that he had wasted his goods.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And he called him, and said to him: How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship: for now thou canst be steward no longer.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>Therefore calling together every one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>But he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down quickly, and write fifty.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>Then he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill, and write eighty.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the <u>mammon of iniquity</u>; that when you shall fail, <u>they may receive</u> you into everlasting dwellings.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in that which is greater: and he that is unjust in that which is little, is unjust also in that which is greater.
</p>
<p class=note>
[9] <u>"Mammon of iniquity"</u>: Mammon signifies riches. They are here called the mammon of iniquity, because oftentimes ill gotten, ill bestowed, or an occasion of evil; and at the best are but worldly, and false; and not the true riches of a Christian.
</p>
<p class=note>
[9] <u>"They may receive"</u>: By this we see, that the poor servants of God, whom we have relieved by our alms, may hereafter, by their intercession, bring our souls to heaven.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon; who will trust you with that which is the true?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And if you have not been faithful in that which is another's; who will give you that which is your own?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>Now the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And he said to them: You are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is high to men, is an abomination before God.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one useth violence towards it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fall.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband, committeth adultery.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen; and feasted sumptuously every day.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full of sores,
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table, and no one did give him; moreover the dogs came, and licked his sores.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into <u>Abraham's bosom</u>. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And he cried, and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazarus evil things, but now he is comforted; and thou art tormented.
</p>
<p class=note>
[22] <u>"Abraham's bosom"</u>: The place of rest, where the souls of the saints resided, till Christ had opened heaven by his death.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come hither.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst send him to my father's house, for I have five brethren,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=16&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead.
