<p class=desc>Women must have a covering over their heads. He blameth the abuses of their love feasts and upon that occasion treats of the Blessed Sacrament.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me: and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered, disgraceth his head.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered, disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>The man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>Therefore ought the woman to have <u>a power</u> over her head, because of the angels.
</p>
<p class=note>
[10] <u>"A power"</u>: that is, a veil or covering, as a sign that she is under the power of her husband: and this, the apostle adds, because of the angels, who are present in the assemblies of the faithful.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>You yourselves judge: doth it become a woman, to pray unto God uncovered?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the church of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you; and in part I believe it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>For <u>there must be also heresies</u>: that they also, who are approved, may be made manifest among you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat <u>the Lord's supper</u>.
</p>
<p class=note>
[19] <u>"There must be also heresies"</u>: By reason of the pride and perversity of man's heart; not by God's will or appointment; who nevertheless draws good out of this evil, manifesting, by that occasion, who are the good and firm Christians, and making their faith more remarkable.
</p>
<p class=note>
[20] <u>"The Lord's supper"</u>: So the apostle here calls the charity feasts observed by the primitive Christians; and reprehends the abuses of the Corinthians, on these occasions; which were the more criminal, because these feasts were accompanied with the celebrating of the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, <u>or drink</u> the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be <u>guilty of the body</u> and of the blood of the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and <u>drink of the chalice</u>.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you, and many sleep.
</p>
<p class=note>
[27] <u>"Or drink"</u>: Here erroneous translators corrupted the text, by putting "and drink" (contrary to the original) instead of "or drink".
</p>
<p class=note>
[27] <u>"Guilty of the body"</u>: not discerning the body. This demonstrates the real presence of the body and blood of Christ, even to the unworthy communicant; who otherwise could not be guilty of the body and blood of Christ, or justly condemned for not discerning the Lord's body.
</p>
<p class=note>
[28] <u>"Drink of the chalice"</u>: This is not said by way of command, but by way of allowance, viz., where and when it is agreeable to the practice and discipline of the church.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=53&ch=11&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come.
