<p class=desc>Isaac sojourneth in Gerara, where God reneweth to him the promise made to Abraham. King Abimelech maketh league with him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And when a famine came in the land, after that barrenness which had happened in the days of Abraham, Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Palestines to Gerara.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And the Lord appeared to him and said: Go not down into Egypt, but stay in the land that I shall tell thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed I will give all these countries, to fulfill the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven: and I will give to thy posterity all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts and commandments, and observed my ceremonies and laws.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>So Isaac abode in Gerara.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And when he was asked by the men of that place, concerning his wife, he answered: She is my sister; for he was afraid to confess that she was his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would kill him because of her beauty.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And when very many days were passed, and he abode there, Abimelech king of the Palestines looking out through a window, saw him playing with Rebecca his wife.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And calling for him, he said: It is evident she is thy wife: why didst thou feign her to be thy sister? He answered: I feared lest I should die for her sake.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And Abimelech said: Why hast thou deceived us? Some man of the people might have lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us a great sin. And he commanded all the people, saying:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>He that shall touch this man's wife, shall surely be put to death.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found that same year a hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And the man was enriched, and he went on prospering and increasing, till he became exceeding great:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And he had possessions of sheep and of herds, and a very great family. Wherefore the Palestines envying him,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Stopped up at that time all the wells, that the servants of his father Abraham had digged, filling them up with earth:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to Isaac: Depart from us, for thou art become much mightier than we.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>So he departed and came to the torrent of Gerara, to dwell there:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And he digged again other wells, which the servants of his father Abraham had digged, and which, after his death, the Palestines had of old stopped up: and he called them by the same names by which his father before had called them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And they digged in the <u>torrent</u>, and found living water.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against the herdsmen of Isaac, saying: It is our water. Wherefore he called the name of the well, on occasion of that which had happened, Calumny.
</p>
<p class=note>
[19] <u>"Torrent"</u>: That is, a channel where sometimes a torrent or violent stream had run.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And they digged also another; and for that they quarrelled likewise, and he called the name of it, Enmity.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>Going forward from thence, he digged another well, for which they contended not: therefore he called the name thereof, <u>Latitude</u>, saying: Now hath the Lord given us room, and made us to increase upon the earth.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And he went up from that place to Bersabee,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Where the Lord appeared to him that same night, saying: I am the God of Abraham thy father; do not fear, for I am with thee: I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And he built there an altar: and called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent: and commanded his servants to dig a well.
</p>
<p class=note>
[22] <u>"Latitude"</u>: That is, wideness, or room.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>To which place when Abimelech, and Ochozath his friend, and Phicol chief captain of his soldiers came from Gerara,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>Isaac said to them: Why are ye come to me, a man whom you hate, and have thrust out from you?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And they answered: We saw that the Lord is with thee, and therefore we said: Let there be an oath between us, and let us make a covenant,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>That thou do us no harm, as we on our part have touched nothing of thine, nor have done any thing to hurt thee: but with peace have sent thee away increased with the blessing of the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And he made them a feast, and after they had eaten and drunk:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>Arising in the morning, they swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away peaceably to their own home.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And behold the same day the servants of Isaac came, telling him of a well which they had digged, and saying: We have found water.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>Whereupon he called it Abundance: and the name of the city was called Bersabee, even to this day.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>And Esau being forty years old, married wives, Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hethite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon of the same place.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=1&ch=26&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>And they both offended the mind of Isaac and Rebecca.
