<p class=desc>Christ rebukes the Pharisees. He heals the daughter of the woman of Chanaan; and the man that was deaf and dumb.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews eat not without often washing their hands, holding the tradition of the ancients:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots, and of brazen vessels, and of beds.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And in vain do they worship me, teaching <u>doctrines and precepts of men</u>.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>For Moses said: Honour thy father and thy mother; and He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die.
</p>
<p class=note>
[7] <u>"Doctrines and precepts of men"</u>: See the annotations, Matt. 15. 9, 11.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban, (which is a gift,) whatsoever is from me, shall profit thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all, and understand.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>There is nothing from without a man that entering into him, can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? understand you not that every thing from without, entering into a man cannot defile him:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>All these evil things come from within, and defile a man.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not be hid.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And he said to her: For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed, and that the devil was gone out.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=48&ch=7&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
