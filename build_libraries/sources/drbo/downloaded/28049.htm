<p class=desc>The like desolation of Ammon, of Idumea, of the Syrians, of the Agarenes, and of the Elamites.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Against the children of Ammon. Thus saith the Lord: Hath Israel no sons? or hath he no heir? Why then hath <u>Melchom</u> inherited Gad: and his people dwelt in his cities?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will cause the noise of war to be heard in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and it shall be destroyed into a heap, and her daughters shall be burnt with fire, and Israel shall possess them that have possessed him, saith the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>Howl, O Hesebon, for Hai is wasted. Cry, ye daughters of Rabbath, gird yourselves with haircloth: mourn and go about by the hedges: for Melchom shall be carried into captivity, his priests, and his princes together.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>Why gloriest thou in the valleys? thy valley hath flowed away, O delicate daughter, that hast trusted in thy treasures, and hast said: Who shall come to me?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>Behold I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord God of hosts, from all that are round about thee: and you shall be scattered every one out of one another's sight, neither shall there be any to gather together them that flee.
</p>
<p class=note>
[1] <u>"Melchom"</u>: The idol of the Ammonites.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And afterwards I will cause the captives of the children of Ammon to return, saith the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>Against Edom. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Theman? counsel is perished from her children: their wisdom is become unprofitable.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>Flee and turn your backs, go down into the deep hole, ye inhabitants of Dedan: for I have brought the destruction of Esau upon him, the time of his visitation.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>If grapegatherers had come to thee, would they not have left a bunch? if thieves in the night, they would have taken what was enough for them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>But I have made Esau bare, I have revealed his secrets, and he cannot be hid: his seed is laid waste, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he shall not be.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>Leave thy fatherless children: I will make them live: and thy widows shall hope in me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>For thus saith the Lord: Behold they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup, shall certainly drink: and shalt thou come off as innocent? thou shalt not come off as innocent, but drinking thou shalt drink.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, that Bosra shall become a desolation, and a reproach, and a desert, and a curse: and all her cities shall be everlasting wastes.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>I have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is sent to the nations: Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and let us rise up to battle.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>For behold I have made thee a little one among the nations, despicable among men.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>Thy arrogancy hath deceived thee, and the pride of thy heart: O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, and endeavourest to lay hold on the height of the hill: but though thou shouldst make thy nest as high as an eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And Edom shall be desolate: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all its plagues.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha, and the neighbours thereof, saith the Lord: there shall not a man dwell there, and there shall no son of man inhabit it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>Behold one shall come up as a lion from the swelling of the Jordan, against the strong and beautiful: for I will make him run suddenly upon her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint over her? for who is like to me? and who shall abide me? and who is that shepherd that can withstand my countenance?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath taken concerning Edom: and his thoughts which he hath thought concerning the inhabitants of Theman: surely the little ones of the flock shall cast them down, of a truth they shall destroy them with their habitation.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>The earth is moved at the noise of their fall: the cry of their voice is heard in the Red Sea.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>Behold he shall come up as an eagle, and fly: and he shall spread his wings over Bosra: and in that day the heart of the valiant ones of Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in labour.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>Against Damascus. Emath is confounded and Arphad: for they have heard very bad tidings, they are troubled as in the sea: through care they could not rest.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Damascus is undone, she is put to flight, trembling hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in labour.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>How have they forsaken the city of renown, the city of joy!
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets: and all the men of war shall be silent in that day, saith the Lord of hosts.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the strong holds of Benadad.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a><u>Against Cedar and against the kingdoms of Asor</u>, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon destroyed. Thus saith the Lord: Arise, and go ye up to Cedar, and waste the children of the east.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>They shall take their tents, and their flocks: and shall carry off for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels: and they shall call fear upon them round about.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>Flee ye, get away speedily, sit in deep holes, you that inhabit Asor, saith the Lord: for Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived designs against you.
</p>
<p class=note>
[28] <u>"Against Cedar and against the kingdoms of Asor"</u>: Were parts of Arabia; which with Moab, Ammon, Edom, etc., were all brought under the yoke of Nabuchodonosor.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>Arise, and go up to a nation that is at ease, and that dwelleth securely, saith the Lord: they have neither gates, nor bars: they dwell alone.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And their camels shall be for a spoil, and the multitude of their cattle for a booty, and I will scatter into every wind them that have their hair cut round, and I will bring destruction upon them from all their confines, saith the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And Asor shall be a habitation for dragons, desolate for ever: no man shall abide there, nor son of man inhabit it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias the prophet against <u>Elam</u>, in the beginning of the reign of Sedecias king of Juda, saying:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will break the bow of Elam, and their chief strength.
</p>
<p class=note>
[34] <u>"Elam"</u>: A part of Persia.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>And I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven: and I will scatter them into all these winds: and there shall be no nation, to which the fugitives of Elam shall not come.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And I will cause Elam to be afraid before their enemies, and in the sight of them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, my fierce wrath, saith the Lord: and will send the sword after them, till I consume them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>And I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy kings and princes from thence, saith the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=49&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>But in the latter days I will cause the captives of Elam, to return, saith the Lord.
