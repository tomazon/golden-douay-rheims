<p class=desc>Christ's resurrection and manifestation of himself to his disciples.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And going in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this, behold, two men stood by them, in shining apparel.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their countenance towards the ground, they said unto them: Why seek you the living with the dead?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was in Galilee,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>Saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And they remembered his words.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And it was Mary Magdalen, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And these words seemed to them as idle tales; and they did not believe them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves; and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also drawing near, went with them.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>But their eyes were held, that they should not know him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk, and are sad?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger to Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people;
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>But we hoped, that it was he that should have redeemed Israel: and now besides all this, today is the third day since these things were done.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us, who before it was light, were at the sepulchre,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And not finding his body, came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And some of our people went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said, but him they found not.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>Then he said to them: O foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all things which the prophets have spoken.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to enter into his glory?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures, the things that were concerning him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And they drew nigh to the town, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>But they constrained him; saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and he vanished out of their sight.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in this way, and opened to us the scriptures?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were staying with them,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>Saying: The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>And they told what things were done in the way; and how they knew him in the breaking of the bread.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>Now whilst they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them, and saith to them: Peace be to you; it is I, fear not.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and feet.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>But while they yet believed not, and wondered for joy, he said: Have you any thing to eat?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, the third day:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=48-#x">&nbsp;48&nbsp;</a>And you are witnesses of these things.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=49-#x">&nbsp;49&nbsp;</a>And I send <u>the promise of my Father</u> upon you: but stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=50-#x">&nbsp;50&nbsp;</a>And he led them out as far as Bethania: and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.
</p>
<p class=note>
[49] <u>"The promise of my Father"</u>: that is, the Holy Ghost, whom Christ had promised that his Father and he would send, John 14. 26, and 17. 7.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=51-#x">&nbsp;51&nbsp;</a>And it came to pass, whilst he blessed them, he departed from them, and was carried up to heaven.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=52-#x">&nbsp;52&nbsp;</a>And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=24&l=53-#x">&nbsp;53&nbsp;</a>And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
