<p class=desc>Paul preaches to the Thessalonians and Bereans. His discourse to the Athenians.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And Paul, according to his custom, went in unto them; and for three sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the scriptures:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>Declaring and insinuating that the Christ was to suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this is Jesus Christ, whom I preach to you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And some of them believed, and were associated to Paul and Silas; and of those that served God, and of the Gentiles a great multitude, and of noble women not a few.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>But the Jews, moved with envy, and taking unto them some wicked men of the vulgar sort, and making a tumult, set the city in an uproar; and besetting Jason's house, sought to bring them out unto the people.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain brethren to the rulers of the <u>city</u>, crying: They that set the city in an uproar, are come hither also;
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>Whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And they stirred up the people, and the rulers of the city hearing these things,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And having taken satisfaction of Jason and of the rest, they let them go.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea. Who, when they were come thither, went into the synagogue of the Jews.
</p>
<p class=note>
[6] <u>"City"</u>: Urbem. In the Greek, the world.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>Now these were <u>more noble</u> than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And many indeed of them believed, and of honourable women that were Gentiles, and of men not a few.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was also preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, stirring up and troubling the multitude.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to go unto the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.
</p>
<p class=note>
[11] <u>"More noble"</u>: The Jews of Berea are justly commended, for their eagerly embracing the truth, and searching the scriptures, to find out the texts alleged by the apostle: which was a far more generous proceeding than that of their countrymen at Thessalonica, who persecuted the preachers of the gospel, without examining the grounds they alleged for what they taught.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, seeing the city wholly given to idolatry.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the Jews, and with them that served God, and in the marketplace, every day with them that were there.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics disputed with him; and some said: What is it, that this word sower would say? But others: He seemeth to be a setter forth of new gods; because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we know what this new doctrine is, which thou speakest of?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears. We would know therefore what these things mean.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>(Now all the Athenians, and strangers that were there, employed themselves in nothing else, but either in telling or in hearing some new thing.)
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>But Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>For passing by, and seeing your idols, I found an altar also, on which was written: To the unknown God. What therefore you worship, without knowing it, that I preach to you:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>God, who made the world, and all things therein; he, being Lord of heaven and earth, <u>dwelleth not in temples</u> made with hands;
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>Neither is he served with men's hands, as though he needed any thing; seeing it is he who giveth to all life, and breath, and all things:
</p>
<p class=note>
[24] <u>"Dwelleth not in temples"</u>: God is not contained in temples; so as to need them for his dwelling, or any other uses, as the heathens imagined. Yet by his omnipresence, he is both there and everywhere.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, determining appointed times, and the limits of their habitation.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>That they should seek God, if happily they may feel after him or find him, although he be not far from every one of us:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>For in him we live, and move, and are; as some also of your own poets said: For we are also his offspring.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not suppose the divinity to be like unto gold, or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And God indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now declareth unto men, that all should everywhere do penance.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in equity, by the man whom he hath appointed; giving faith to all, by raising him up from the dead.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And when they had heard of the resurrection of the dead, some indeed mocked, but others said: We will hear thee again concerning this matter.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>So Paul went out from among them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=51&ch=17&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>But certain men adhering to him, did believe; among whom was also Dionysius, the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
