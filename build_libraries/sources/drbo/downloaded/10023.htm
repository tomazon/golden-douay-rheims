<p class=desc>The last words of David. A catalogue of his valiant men.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Now these are David's last words. David the son of Isai said: The man to whom it was appointed concerning the Christ of the God of Jacob, the excellent psalmist of Israel said:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>The spirit of the Lord hath spoken by me and his word by my tongue.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>The God of Israel said to me, the strong one of Israel spoke, the ruler of men, the just ruler in the fear of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a><u>As the light</u> of the morning, when the sun riseth, shineth in the morning without clouds, and as the grass springeth out of the earth by rain.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a><u>Neither is my house</u> so great with God, that he should make with me an eternal covenant, firm in all things and assured. For he is all my salvation, and all my will: neither is there ought thereof that springeth not up.
</p>
<p class=note>
[4] <u>"As the light"</u>: So shall be the kingdom of Christ.
</p>
<p class=note>
[5] <u>"Neither is my house"</u>: As if he should say: This everlasting covenant was not due to my house: but purely owing to his bounty; who is all my salvation, and my will: that is, who hath always saved me, and granted me what I beseeched of him; so that I and my house, through his blessing, have sprung up, and succeeded in all things.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>But transgressors shall all of them be plucked up as thorns: which are not taken away with hands.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And if a man will touch them, he must be armed with iron and with the staff of a lance: but they shall be set on fire and burnt to nothing.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>These are the names of the valiant men of David. <u>Jesbaham</u> sitting in the chair was the wisest chief among the three, he was like the <u>most tender</u> little worm of the wood, who killed eight hundred men at one onset.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>After him was Eleazar the son of <u>Dodo</u> the Ahohite, one of the three valiant men that were with David when they defied the Philistines, and they were there gathered together to battle.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And when the men of Israel were gone away, he stood and smote the Philistines till his hand was weary, and grew stiff with the sword: and the Lord wrought a great victory that day: and the people that were fled away, returned to take spoils of them that were slain.
</p>
<p class=note>
[8] <u>"Jesbaham"</u>: The son of Hachamoni. For this was the name of this hero, as appears from 1 Chron. or Paralip. 11.-- Ibid.
</p>
<p class=note>
[8] <u>"Most tender"</u>: He appeared like one tender and weak, but was indeed most valiant and strong. It seems the Latin has here given the interpretation of the Hebrew name of the hero, to whom Jesbaham was like, instead of the name itself, which was Adino the Eznite, one much renowned of old for his valour.
</p>
<p class=note>
[9] <u>"Dodo"</u>: In Latin, Patrui ejus, which is the interpretation of the Hebrew name Dodo. The same occurs in ver. 24.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And after him was Semma the son of Age of Arari. And the Philistines were gathered together in a troop: for there was a field full of lentils. And when the people were fled from the face of the Philistines,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>He stood in the midst of the field, and defended it, and defeated the Philistines: and the Lord gave a great victory.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Moreover also before this the three who were princes among the thirty, went down and came to David in the harvest time into the cave of Odollam: and the camp of the Philistines was in the valley of the giants.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>And David was then in a hold. and there was a garrison of the Philistines then in Bethlehem.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And David longed, and said: O that some man would get me a drink of the water out of the cistern, that is in Bethlehem, by the gate.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>And the three valiant men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and brought it to David: but he would not drink, but offered it to the Lord,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Saying: The Lord be merciful to me, that I may not do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that went, and the peril of their lives? therefore he would not drink. These things did these three mighty men.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>Abisai also the brother of Joab, the son of Sarvia, was chief among three: and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And the noblest of three, and was their chief, but to the three first he attained not.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And Banaias the son of Joiada a most valiant man, of great deeds, of Cabseel: he slew the two lions of Moab, and he went down, and slew a lion in the midst of a pit, in the time of snow.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>He also slew an Egyptian, a man worthy to be a sight, having a spear in his hand: but he went down to him with a rod, and forced the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, and slew him with his own spear.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>These things did Banaias the son of Joiada.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And he was renowned among the three valiant men, who were the most honourable among the thirty: but he attained not to the first three: and David made him of his privy council.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Asael the brother of Joab was one of the thirty, Elehanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=10&ch=23&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>Semma of Harodi, Elica of Harodi,
