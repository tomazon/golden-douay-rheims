<p class=desc>Christ has freed us from the servitude of the law. We are the freeborn sons of Abraham.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>So we also, when we were children, were serving <u>under the elements</u> of the world.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons.
</p>
<p class=note>
[3] <u>"Under the elements"</u>: That is, under the first rudiments of religion, in which the carnal Jews were trained up; or under those corporeal creatures, used in their manifold rites, sacrifices, and sacraments.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them, who, by nature, are not gods.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements, which you desire to serve again?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a><u>You observe days</u>, and months, and times, and years.
</p>
<p class=note>
[10] <u>"You observe days"</u>: He speaks not of the observation of the Lord's day, or other Christian festivals; but either of the superstitious observation of days lucky and unlucky; or else of the Jewish festivals, to the observance of which, certain Jewish teachers sought to induce the Galatians.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Be ye as I, because I also am as you: brethren, I beseech you: you have not injured me at all.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And you know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness, that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and would have given them to me.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And I would willingly be present with you now, and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free woman.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage; which is Agar:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is our mother.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>But as then he, that was born according to the flesh, persecuted him that was after the spirit; so also it is now.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=4&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free.
