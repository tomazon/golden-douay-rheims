<p class=desc>The Spirit, and the blessing promised to Abraham cometh not by the law, but by faith.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you; doth he do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of the faith?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And the scripture, foreseeing, that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>Therefore they that are of faith, shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one, that abideth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to do them.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>But the law is not of faith: but, He that doth those things, shall live in them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Brethren (I speak after the manner of man,) yet a man's testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth, nor addeth to it.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not, And to his seeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Now this I say, that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years, doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>Why then was the law? It was set <u>because of transgressions</u>, until the seed should come, to whom he made the promise, being <u>ordained by angels</u> in the hand of a mediator.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.
</p>
<p class=note>
[19] <u>"Because of transgressions"</u>: To restrain them from sin, by fear and threats.
</p>
<p class=note>
[19] <u>"Ordained by angels"</u>: The law was delivered by angels, speaking in the name and person of God to Moses, who was the mediator, on this occasion, between God and the people.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>Was the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>But the scripture <u>hath concluded all under sin</u>, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Wherefore the law was our <u>pedagogue</u> in Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.
</p>
<p class=note>
[22] <u>"Hath concluded all under sin"</u>: that is, hath declared all to be under sin, from which they could not be delivered but by faith in Jesus Christ, the promised seed.
</p>
<p class=note>
[24] <u>"Pedagogue"</u>: That is, schoolmaster, conductor, or instructor.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>For you are all the children of God by faith, in Christ Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>There is <u>neither Jew</u> nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=55&ch=3&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>And if you be Christ's, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.
<p class=note>
[28] <u>"Neither Jew"</u>: That is, no distinction of Jew, etc.
