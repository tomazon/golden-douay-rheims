<p class=desc>A prophecy of the desolation of Moab for their pride: but their captivity shall at last be released.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Against Moab thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Woe to Nabo, for it is laid waste, and confounded: Cariathaim is taken: the strong city is confounded and hath trembled.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>There is no more rejoicing in Moab over Hesebon: they have devised evil. Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Therefore shalt thou in silence hold thy peace, and the sword shall follow thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>A voice of crying from Oronaim: waste, and great destruction.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>Moab is destroyed: proclaim a cry for her little ones.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>For by the ascent of Luith shall the mourner go up with weeping: for in the descent of Oronaim the enemies have heard a howling of destruction.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>Flee, save your lives: and be as heath in the wilderness.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>For because thou hast trusted in thy bulwarks, and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and <u>Chamos</u> shall go into captivity, his priests, and his princes together.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: and the valleys shall perish, and the plains shall be destroyed, for the Lord hath spoken:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>Give a flower to Moab, for in its flower it shall go out: and the cities thereof shall be desolate, and uninhabited.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord <u>deceitfully</u>: and cursed be he that withholdeth his sword from blood.
</p>
<p class=note>
[7] <u>"Chamos"</u>: The idol of the Moabites.
</p>
<p class=note>
[10] <u>"Deceitfully"</u>: In the Greek, negligently. The work of God here spoken of, is the punishment of the Moabites.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a><u>Moab hath been fruitful</u> from his youth, <u>and hath rested upon his lees</u>: and hath not been poured out from vessel to vessel, nor hath gone into captivity: therefore his taste hath remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send him men that shall order and overturn his bottles, and they shall cast him down, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles one against another.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, as the house of Israel was ashamed <u>of Bethel</u>, in which they trusted.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>How do you say: We are valiant, and stout men in battle?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Moab is laid waste, and they have cast down her cities: and her choice young men are gone down to the slaughter: saith the king, whose name is the Lord of hosts.
</p>
<p class=note>
[11] <u>"Moab hath been fruitful"</u>: That is, rich and flourishing.
</p>
<p class=note>
[11] <u>"And hath rested upon his lees"</u>: That is, remained in its bad morals; as wine not decanted has its lees mixed and remains muddy.
</p>
<p class=note>
[13] <u>"Of Bethel"</u>: That is, of their golden calf which they worshipped in Bethel.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>The destruction of Moab is near to come: the calamity thereof shall come on exceeding swiftly.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Comfort him, all you that are round about him, and all you that know his name, say: How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>Come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst, O dwelling of the daughter of Dibon: because the spoiler of Moab is come up to thee, he hath destroyed thy bulwarks.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>Stand in the way, and look out, O habitation of Aroer: inquire of him that fleeth: and say to him that hath escaped: What Is done?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Moab is confounded, because he is overthrown: howl ye, and cry, tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is wasted.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>And judgment is come upon the plain country: upon Helon, and upon Jasa, and upon Mephaath.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And upon Dibon, and upon Nabo, and upon the house of Deblathaim,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And upon Cariathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmaon,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And upon Carioth, and upon Bosra: and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a><u>The horn of Moab is cut off</u>, and his arm is broken, saith the Lord.
</p>
<p class=note>
[25] <u>"The horn of Moab is cut off"</u>: That is, the strength of Moab is cut off. A metaphor drawn from animals whose strength is in their horns.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>Make him drunk, because he lifted up himself against the Lord: and Moab shall dash his hand in his own vomit, and he also shall be in derision.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>For Israel hath been a derision unto thee: as though thou hadst found him amongst thieves: for thy words therefore, which thou hast spoken against him, thou shalt be led away captive.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, you that dwell in Moab: and be ye like the dove that maketh her nest in the mouth of the hole in the highest place.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>We have heard the pride of Moab, he is exceeding proud: his haughtiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the loftiness of his heart.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>I know, saith the Lord, his boasting, and that the strength thereof is not according to it, neither hath it endeavoured to do according as it was able.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>Therefore will I lament for Moab, and I will cry out to all Moab, for the men of the brick wall that mourn.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>O vineyard of Sabama, I will weep for thee, with the mourning of Jazer: thy branches are gone over the sea, they are come even to the sea of Jazer: the robber hath rushed in upon thy harvest and thy vintage.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>Joy and gladness is taken away from Carmel, and from the land of Moab, and I have taken away the wine out of the presses: the treader of the grapes shall not sing the accustomed cheerful tune.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>From the cry of Hesebon even to Eleale, and to Jasa, they have uttered their voice: from Segor to Oronaim, as a heifer of three years old: the waters also of Nemrim shall be very bad.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>And I will take away from Moab, saith the Lord, him that offereth in the high places, and that sacrificeth to his gods.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes: and my heart a sound like pipes for the men of the brick wall: because he hath done more than he could, therefore they have perished.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>For every head shall be bald, and every beard shall be shaven: all hands shall be tied together, and upon every back there shall be haircloth.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>Upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof general mourning: because I have broken Moab as an useless vessel, saith the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>How is it overthrown, and they have howled! How hath Moab bowed down the neck, and is confounded! And Moab shall be a derision, and an example to all round about him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>Thus saith the Lord: Behold he shall fly as an eagle, and shall stretch forth his wings to Moab.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>Carioth is taken, and the strong holds are won: and the heart of the valiant men of Moab in that day shall be as the heart of a woman in labour.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>And Moab shall cease to be a people: because he hath gloried against the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a><u>Fear</u>, and <u>the pit</u>, and <u>the snare</u> come upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>He that shall flee from the fear, shall fall into the pit: and he that shall get up out of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon Moab the year of their visitation, saith the Lord.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>They that fled from the snare stood in the shadow of Hesebon: but there came a fire out of Hesebon, and a flame out of the midst of Seon, and it shall devour part of Moab. and the crown of the head of the children of tumult.
</p>
<p class=note>
[43] <u>"Fear"</u>: That is, the sword of the enemy.
</p>
<p class=note>
[43] <u>"The pit"</u>: That is, unforeseen calamities.
</p>
<p class=note>
[43] <u>"The snare"</u>: That is, the ambushes laid by the enemy.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>Woe to thee, Moab, thou hast perished, O people of Chamos: for thy sons, and thy daughters are taken captives.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=28&ch=48&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>And I will bring back the captivity of Moab in the last days, saith the Lord. Hitherto the judgments of Moab.
