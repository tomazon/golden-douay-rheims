<p class=desc>The prophet foretells the terrible day of the Lord; exhorts	sinners to a sincere conversion; and comforts God's people with promises of future blessings under Christ.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>Blow ye the trumpet in Sion, sound an alarm in my holy mountain, let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: because <u>the day of the Lord</u> cometh, because it is nigh at hand,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>A day of darkness, and of gloominess, a day of clouds and whirlwinds: <u>a numerous and strong people</u> as the morning spread upon the mountains: the like to it hath not been from the beginning, nor shall be after it even to the years of generation and generation.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>Before the face thereof a devouring fire, and behind it a burning flame: the land is like a garden of pleasure before it, and behind it a desolate wilderness, neither is there any one that can escape it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses, and they shall run like horsemen.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>They shall leap like the noise of chariots upon the tops of mountains, like the noise of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, as a strong people prepared to battle.
</p>
<p class=note>
[1] <u>"The day of the Lord"</u>: That is, the time when he will execute justice upon sinners.
</p>
<p class=note>
[2] <u>"A numerous and strong people"</u>: The Assyrians, or Chaldeans. Others understand all this of an army of locusts laying waste the land.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>At their presence the people shall be in grievous pains: all faces shall be made like a kettle.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>They shall run like valiant men: like men of war they shall scale the wall: the men shall march every one on his way, and they shall not turn aside from their ranks.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>No one shall press upon his brother: they shall walk every one in his path: yea, and they shall fall through the windows, and shall take no harm.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>They shall enter into the city: they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up the houses, they shall come in at the windows as a thief.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>At their presence the earth hath trembled, the heavens are moved: the sun and moon are darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And the Lord hath uttered his voice before the face of his army: for his armies are exceeding great, for they are strong and execute his word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible: and who can stand it?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>Now therefore saith the Lord: Be converted to me with all your heart, in fasting, and in weeping, and in mourning.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And rend your hearts, and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, patient and rich in mercy, and ready to repent of the evil.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>Who knoweth but he will return, and forgive, and leave a blessing behind him, sacrifice and libation to the Lord your God?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Blow the trumpet in Sion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly,
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>Gather together the people, sanctify the church, assemble the ancients, gather together the little ones, and them that suck at the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth from his bed, and the bride out of her bride chamber.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Between the porch and the altar the priests the Lord's ministers shall weep, and shall say: Spare, O Lord, spare thy people: and give not thy inheritance to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them. Why should they say among the nations: Where is their God?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>The Lord hath been zealous for his land, and hath spared his people.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And the Lord answered and said to his people: Behold I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and you shall be filled with them: and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And I will remove far off from you <u>the northern enemy</u>: and I will drive him into a land unpassable, and desert, with his face towards the east sea, and his hinder part towards the utmost sea: and his stench shall ascend, and his rottenness shall go up, because he hath done proudly.
</p>
<p class=note>
[20] <u>"The northern enemy"</u>: Some understand this of Holofernes and his army: others, of the locusts.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice: for the Lord hath done great things.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>Fear not, ye beasts of the fields: for the beautiful places of the wilderness are sprung, for the tree hath brought forth its fruit, the fig tree, and the vine have yielded their strength.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>And you, O children of Sion, rejoice, and be joyful in the Lord your God: because he hath given you a teacher of justice, and he will make the early and the latter rain to come down to you as in the beginning.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And the floors shall be filled with wheat, and the presses shall overflow with wine and oil.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And I will restore to you the ears which the locust, and the bruchus, and the mildew, and the palmerworm have eaten; my great host which I sent upon you.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And you shall eat in plenty, and shall be filled: and you shall praise the name of the Lord your God, who hath done wonders with you, and my people shall not be confounded for ever.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel: and I am the Lord your God, and there is none besides: and my people shall not be confounded for ever.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>Moreover upon my servants and handmaids in those days I will pour forth my spirit.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>And I will shew wonders in heaven; and in earth, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood: before the great and dreadful day of the Lord doth come.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=34&ch=2&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved: for in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem shall be salvation, as the Lord hath said, and in the residue whom the Lord shall call.
