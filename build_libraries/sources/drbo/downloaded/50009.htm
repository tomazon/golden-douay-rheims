<p class=desc>He gives sight to the man born blind.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And Jesus passing by, saw a man, who was blind from his birth:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>When he had said these things, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on his eyes,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore, and washed, and he came seeing.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>The neighbours therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: This is he.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe, and wash. And I went, I washed, and I see.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened thy eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him speak for himself.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>Therefore did his parents say: He is of age, ask himself.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>They therefore called the man again that had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard: why would you hear it again? will you also become his disciples?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>They reviled him therefore, and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>The man answered, and said to them: Why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said: For judgment <u>I am come</u> into this world; that they who see not, may see; and they who see, may become blind.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?
</p>
<p class=note>
[39] <u>"I am come"</u>: Not that Christ came for that end, that any one should be made blind: but that the Jews, by the abuse of his coming, and by their not receiving him, brought upon themselves this judgment of blindness.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=9&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>Jesus said to them: <u>If you were blind</u>, you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth.
<p class=note>
[41] <u>"If you were blind"</u>: If you were invincibly ignorant, and had neither read the scriptures, nor seen my miracles, you would not be guilty of the sin of infidelity: but now, as you boast of your knowledge of the scriptures, you are inexcusable.
