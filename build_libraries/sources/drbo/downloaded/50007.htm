<p class=desc>Christ goes up to the feast of the tabernacles. He teaches in the temple.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And his brethren said to him: Pass from hence, and go into Judea; that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>For neither did his brethren believe in him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth: because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>Go you up to this festival day, but I go not up to this festival day: because my time is not accomplished.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>When he had said these things, he himself stayed in Galilee.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day, and said: Where is he?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others said: No, but he seduceth the people.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>And the Jews wondered, saying: How doth this man know letters, having never learned?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered them, and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>If any man do the will of him; he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no injustice in him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered, and said: Thou hast a devil; who seeketh to kill thee?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>Jesus answered, and said to them: One work I have done; and you all wonder:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>Therefore, Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and on the sabbath day you circumcise a man.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you angry at me because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath day?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge just judgment.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>Some therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And behold, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers known for a truth, that this is the Christ?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>But we know this man, whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching, and saying: You both know me, and you know whence I am: and I am not come of myself; but he that sent me, is true, whom you know not.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>I know him, because I am from him, and he hath sent me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>They sought therefore to apprehend him: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>But of the people many believed in him, and said: When the Christ cometh, shall he do more miracles, than these which this man doth?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>The Jews therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you cannot come?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive, who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>Doth not the scripture say: That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town where David was?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>So there arose a dissension among the people because of him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>And some of them would have apprehended him: but no man laid hands on him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not brought him?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>The ministers answered: Never did man speak like this man.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>The Pharisees therefore answered them: Are you also seduced?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=48-#x">&nbsp;48&nbsp;</a>Hath any one of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=49-#x">&nbsp;49&nbsp;</a>But this multitude, that knoweth not the law, are accursed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=50-#x">&nbsp;50&nbsp;</a>Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to him by night, who was one of them:)
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=51-#x">&nbsp;51&nbsp;</a>Doth our law judge any man, unless it first hear him, and know what he doth?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=52-#x">&nbsp;52&nbsp;</a>They answered, and said to him: Art thou also a Galilean? Search the scriptures, and see, that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=50&ch=7&l=53-#x">&nbsp;53&nbsp;</a>And every man returned to his own house.
