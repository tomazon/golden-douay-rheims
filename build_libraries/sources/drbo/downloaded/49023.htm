<p class=desc>The continuation of the history of the passion.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=1-#x">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a>And the whole multitude of them rising up, led him to Pilate.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=2-#x">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a>And they began to accuse him, saying: We have found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he is Christ the king.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=3-#x">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a>And Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, said: Thou sayest it.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=4-#x">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a>And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no cause in this man.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=5-#x">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a>But they were more earnest, saying: He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=6-#x">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a>But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=7-#x">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a>And when he understood that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him away to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem, in those days.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=8-#x">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a>And Herod, seeing Jesus, was very glad; for he was desirous of a long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=9-#x">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a>And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=10-#x">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a>And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, earnestly accusing him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=11-#x">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a>And Herod with his army set him at nought, and mocked him, putting on him a white garment, and sent him back to Pilate.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=12-#x">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a>And Herod and Pilate were made friends, that same day; for before they were enemies one to another.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=13-#x">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a>And Pilate, calling together the chief priests, and the magistrates, and the people,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=14-#x">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a>Said to them: You have presented unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people; and behold I, having examined him before you, find no cause in this man, in those things wherein you accuse him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=15-#x">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a>No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=16-#x">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>I will chastise him therefore, and release him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=17-#x">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a>Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=18-#x">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=19-#x">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a>Who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for a murder, was cast into prison.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=20-#x">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a>And Pilate again spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=21-#x">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a>But they cried again, saying: Crucify him, crucify him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=22-#x">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a>And he said to them the third time: Why, what evil hath this man done? I find no cause of death in him. I will chastise him therefore, and let him go.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=23-#x">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>But they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and their voices prevailed.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=24-#x">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=25-#x">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition, had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=26-#x">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a>And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry after Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=27-#x">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, who bewailed and lamented him.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=28-#x">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>But Jesus turning to them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not over me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=29-#x">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>For behold, the days shall come, wherein they will say: Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the paps that have not given suck.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=30-#x">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains: Fall upon us; and to the hills: Cover us.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=31-#x">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a>For if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry?
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=32-#x">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=33-#x">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified him there; and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=34-#x">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=35-#x">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a>And the people stood beholding, and the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the elect of God.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=36-#x">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=37-#x">&nbsp;37&nbsp;</a>And saying: If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=38-#x">&nbsp;38&nbsp;</a>And there was also a superscription written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=39-#x">&nbsp;39&nbsp;</a>And one of those robbers who were hanged, blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=40-#x">&nbsp;40&nbsp;</a>But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear God, seeing thou art condemned under the same condemnation?
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=41-#x">&nbsp;41&nbsp;</a>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done no evil.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=42-#x">&nbsp;42&nbsp;</a>And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=43-#x">&nbsp;43&nbsp;</a>And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, this day thou shalt be with me <u>in paradise</u>.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=44-#x">&nbsp;44&nbsp;</a>And it was almost the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=45-#x">&nbsp;45&nbsp;</a>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
</p>
<p class=note>
[43] <u>"In paradise"</u>: That is, in the happy state of rest, joy, and peace everlasting. Christ was pleased, by a special privilege, to reward the faith and confession of the penitent thief, with a full discharge of all his sins, both as to the guilt and punishment; and to introduce him immediately after death into the happy society of the saints, whose limbo, that is, the place of their confinement, was now made a paradise by our Lord's going thither.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=46-#x">&nbsp;46&nbsp;</a>And Jesus crying out with a loud voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the ghost.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=47-#x">&nbsp;47&nbsp;</a>Now the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: Indeed this was a just man.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=48-#x">&nbsp;48&nbsp;</a>And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight, and saw the things that were done, returned striking their breasts.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=49-#x">&nbsp;49&nbsp;</a>And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=50-#x">&nbsp;50&nbsp;</a>And behold there was a man named Joseph, who was a counsellor, a good and just man,
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=51-#x">&nbsp;51&nbsp;</a>(The same had not consented to their counsel and doings;) of Arimathea, a city of Judea; who also himself looked for the kingdom of God.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=52-#x">&nbsp;52&nbsp;</a>This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=53-#x">&nbsp;53&nbsp;</a>And taking him down, he wrapped him in fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone, wherein never yet any man had been laid.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=54-#x">&nbsp;54&nbsp;</a>And it was the day of the <u>Parasceve</u>, and the sabbath drew on.
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=55-#x">&nbsp;55&nbsp;</a>And the women that were come with him from Galilee, following after, saw the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
</p>
<p class=note>
[54] <u>"Parasceve"</u>: That is, the eve, or day of preparation for the sabbath.
</p>
<p>
<a class=vn href="/cgi-bin/d?b=drb&bk=49&ch=23&l=56-#x">&nbsp;56&nbsp;</a>And returning, they prepared spices and ointments; and on the sabbath day they rested, according to the commandment.
