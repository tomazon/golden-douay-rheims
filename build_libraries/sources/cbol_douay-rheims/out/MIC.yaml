      v:001: 'MIC:1:1 | 1 | 1 | The  word of the Lord that came to Micheas the Morasthite, in the days of Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings ofJuda: which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.'
      v:002: 'MIC:1:2 | 2 | 2 | Hear, all ye people: and let the earth give ear, and all that is therein: and let the Lord God be a witness to you, the Lord from his holy temple.'
      v:003: 'MIC:1:3 | 3 | 3 | For behold the Lord will come forth out of his place: and he will come down, and will tread upon the high places of the earth.'
      v:004: 'MIC:1:4 | 4 | 4 | And the mountains shall be melted under him: and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as waters that run down a steep place.'
      v:005: 'MIC:1:5 | 5 | 5 | For the wickedness of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the wickedness of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Juda? are they not Jerusalem?'
      v:006: 'MIC:1:6 | 6 | 6 | And I will make Samaria as a heap of stones in the field when a vineyard is planted: and I will bring down the stones thereof into the valley, and will lay her foundations bare.'
      v:007: 'MIC:1:7 | 7 | 7 | And all her graven things shall be cut in pieces, and all {1 her wages} shall be burnt with fire, and I will bring to destruction all her idols: for they were gathered together {2 of the hire of a harlot}, and unto the hire of a harlot they shall return.'
      v:008: 'MIC:1:8 | 8 | 8 | Therefore will I lament and howl: I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and a mourning like the ostriches.'
      v:009: 'MIC:1:9 | 9 | 9 | Because her wound is desperate, because it is come even to Juda, {3 it hath touched the gate} of my people even to Jerusalem.'
      v:010: 'MIC:1:10 | 10 | 10 | {4 Declare ye it not in Geth}, {5 weep ye not} with tears: in the house of Dust sprinkle yourselves with dust.'
      v:011: 'MIC:1:11 | 11 | 11 | And pass away, O {6 thou that dwellest in the Beautiful place}, covered with thy shame: {7 she went not forth} that dwelleth in the confines: {8 the House adjoining} shall receive mourning from you, which stood by herself.'
      v:012: 'MIC:1:12 | 12 | 12 | For {9 she is become weak} unto good that dwelleth in bitterness: for evil is come down from the Lord into the gate of Jerusalem.'
      v:013: 'MIC:1:13 | 13 | 13 | A tumult of chariots hath astonished the inhabitants of Lachis: {10 it is the beginning} of sin to the daughter of Sion, for in thee were found the crimes of Israel.'
      v:014: 'MIC:1:14 | 14 | 14 | {11 Therefore shall she send} messengers to the inheritance of Geth: the houses of lying to deceive the kings of Israel.'

    COMMENTS_TMP_A:
      1:
        caption: 'How shall he depart, &c.'
        content: How do you pretend to say that the Assyrian is departing; when indeed he is coming to divide our lands amongst his subjects?
      2:
        caption: 'Thou shalt have none, &c.'
        content: Thou shalt have no longer any lot or inheritance in the land of the people of the Lord.
      3:
        caption: 'It shall not drop, &c.'
        content: 'That is, the prophecy shall not come upon these. Such were the sentiments of the people that were unwilling to believe the threats of the prophets.'
      4:
        caption: 'You have taken away, &c.'
        content: 'You have even stripped people of their necessary garments: and have treated such as were innocently passing on the way, as if they were at war with you.'
      5:
        caption: 'You have cast out, &c.,'
        content: 'either by depriving them of their houses; or, by your crimes, given occasion to their being carried away captives, and their children, by that means, never learning to praise the Lord.'
      6:
        caption: 'Would God, &c.'
        content: "The prophet could have wished, out of his love to his people, that he might be deceived in denouncing to them these evils that were to fall upon them: but by conforming himself to the will of God, he declares to them, that he is sent to prophesy, literally to <i>let drop</i> upon them, the wine of God''s indignation, with which they should be made drunk; that is, stupefied and cast down."

      v:004: 'MIC:2:4 | 4 | 4 | In that day a parable shall be taken up upon you, and a song shall be sung with melody by them that say: We are laid waste and spoiled: the portion of my people is changed: {1 how shall he depart} from me, whereas he is returning that will divide our land?'

      v:012: 'MIC:2:12 | 12 | 12 | I will assemble and gather together all of thee, O Jacob: I will bring together the remnant of Israel, I will put them together as a flock in the fold, as the sheep in the midst of the sheepcotes, they shall make a tumult by reason of the multitude of men.'
      v:013: 'MIC:2:13 | 13 | 13 | For he shall go up that shall open the way before them: they shall divide, and pass through the gate, and shall come in by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord at the head of them.'
