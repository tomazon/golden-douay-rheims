    COMMENTS_TMP_A:
      1:
        caption: 'The ancient,'
        content: 'that is, the ancient bishop St. John, being the only one of the twelve apostles then living.'
      2:
        caption: To the lady Elect.
        content: 'Some conjecture that <i>Electa</i> might be the name of a family, or of a particular church; but the general opinion is, that it is the proper name of a lady, so eminent for her piety and great charity, as to merit this Epistle from St. John.'
      3:
        caption: 'Nor say to him, God speed you.'
        content: 'This admonition is in general, to forewarn the faithful of the dangers which may arise from a familiarity with those who have prevaricated and gone from the true faith, and with such as teach false doctrine. But this is not forbidding a charity for all men, by which we ought to wish and pray for the eternal salvation of every one, even of our enemies.'
