      1:
        caption: A revolt.
        content: 'This <i>revolt,</i> or <i>falling off,</i> is generally understood, by the ancient fathers, of a <i>revolt</i> from the Roman empire, which was first to be destroyed, before the coming of Antichrist. It may, perhaps, be understood also of a <i>revolt</i> of many nations from the Catholic Church; which has, in part, happened already, by the means of Mahomet, Luther, &c., and it may be supposed, will be more general in the days of the Antichrist.'
      2:
        caption: The man of sin.
        content: 'Here must be meant some particular man, as is evident from the frequent repetition of the Greek article: ὁ, <i>the</i> man of sin, <i>the</i> son of perdition, <i>the</i> adversary or opposer, ὁ ἀντικείμενος. It agrees to the wicked and great Antichrist, who will come before the end of the world.'
      3:
        caption: In the temple.
        content: 'Either that of Jerusalem which some think he will rebuild; or in some Christian church, which he will pervert to his own worship: as Mahomet has done by the churches of the east.'
      4:
        caption: God shall send;
        content: 'that is, God shall suffer them to be deceived by lying wonders, and false miracles, in punishment of their not entertaining the love of truth.'
      5:
        caption: Traditions.
        content: See here that the unwritten <i>traditions</i> of the apostles are no less to be received than their epistles.

      v:001: '2TH:3:1 | 1 | 1 | For the rest, brethren, pray for us, that the word of God {1 may run}, and may be glorified, even as among you;'
      v:002: 2TH:3:2 | 2 | 2 | And that we may be delivered from importunate and evil men; for all men have not faith.

      v:011: '2TH:3:11 | 11 | 11 | For we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly, working not at all, but curiously meddling.'
      v:012: '2TH:3:12 | 12 | 12 | Now we charge them that are such, and beseech them by the Lord Jesus Christ, that, working with silence, they would eat their own bread.'
      v:013: '2TH:3:13 | 13 | 13 | But you, brethren, be not weary in well doing.'
