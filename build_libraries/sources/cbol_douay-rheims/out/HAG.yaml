    COMMENTS_TMP_A:
      1:
        caption: By occasion of a soul.
        content: 'That is, by having touched the dead; in which case, according to the prescription of the law, Num. 19. 13, 22, a person not only became unclean himself, but made every thing that he touched unclean. The prophet applies all this to the people, whose souls remained unclean by neglecting the temple of God; and therefore were not sanctified by the flesh they offered in sacrifice: but rather defiled their sacrifices by approaching to them in the state of uncleanness.'
      2:
        caption: O Zorobabel.
        content: 'This promise principally relates to Christ, who was of the race of Zorobabel.'
