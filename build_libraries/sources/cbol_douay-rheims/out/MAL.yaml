        caption: 'I have loved Jacob, &c.'
        content: 'I have preferred his posterity, to make them my chosen people, and to lead them with my blessings, without any merit on their part, and though they have been always ungrateful; whilst I have rejected Esau, and executed severe judgments upon his posterity. Not that God punished Esau, or his posterity, beyond their desert: but that by his free election and grace he loved Jacob, and favoured his posterity above their deserts. See the annotations upon Rom.9.'
      2:
        caption: A clean oblation.
        content: 'Viz., the precious body and blood of Christ in the eucharistic sacrifice.'
      3:
        caption: 'Behold of our labour, &c.'
        content: 'You pretended <i>labour</i> and weariness, when you brought your offering; and so made it of no value, by offering it with an evil mind. Moreover, what you offered was both defective in itself, and gotten by rapine and extortion.'

      v:007: 'MAL:1:7 | 7 | 7 | To you, O priests, that despise my name, and have said: Wherein have we despised thy name? You offer polluted bread upon my altar, and you say: Wherein have we polluted thee? In that you say: The table of the Lord is contemptible.'
      v:008: 'MAL:1:8 | 8 | 8 | If you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? offer it to thy prince, if he will be pleased with it, or if he will regard thy face, saith the Lord of hosts.'
      v:009: 'MAL:1:9 | 9 | 9 | And now beseech ye the face of God, that he may have mercy on you, (for by your hand hath this been done,) if by any means he will receive your faces, saith the Lord of hosts.'

      v:011: 'MAL:1:11 | 11 | 11 | For from the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is great among the Gentiles, and in every place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to my name {2 a clean oblation}: for my name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord of hosts.'
      v:012: 'MAL:1:12 | 12 | 12 | And you have profaned it in that you say: The table of the Lord is defiled: and that which is laid thereupon is contemptible with the fire that devoureth it.'
      v:013: 'MAL:1:13 | 13 | 13 | And you have said: {3 Behold of our labour}, and you puffed it away, saith the Lord of hosts, and you brought in of rapine the lame, and the sick, and brought in an offering: shall I accept it at your hands, saith the Lord?'
      v:014: 'MAL:1:14 | 14 | 14 | Cursed is the deceitful man that hath in his flock a male, and making a vowoffereth in sacrifice that which is feeble to the Lord: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the Gentiles.'

      v:011: 'MAL:2:11 | 11 | 11 | Juda hath transgressed, and abomination hath been committed in Israel, and in Jerusalem: for Juda hath profaned the holiness of the Lord, which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange God.'
