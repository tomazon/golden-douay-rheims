      v:013: 'WIS:11:13 | 13 | 13 | For a double affliction came upon them, and a groaning for the remembrance of things past.'
      v:014: 'WIS:11:14 | 14 | 14 | For when they heard that {4 by their punishments} the others were benefited, they remembered the Lord, wondering at the end of what was come to pass.'
      v:015: 'WIS:11:15 | 15 | 15 | For whom they scorned before, when he was thrown out at the time of his being wickedly exposed to perish, him they admired in the end, when they saw the event: their thirsting being unlike to that of the just.'
      v:016: 'WIS:11:16 | 16 | 16 | But for the foolish devices of their iniquity, because some being deceived worshipped dumb serpents and worthless beasts, thou didst send upon them a multitude of {5 dumb beasts} for vengeance:'
      v:017: 'WIS:11:17 | 17 | 17 | That they might know that by what things a man sinneth, by the same also he is tormented.'
      v:018: 'WIS:11:18 | 18 | 18 | For thy almighty hand, which made the world of matter without form, was not unable to send upon them a multitude of bears, or fierce lions,'
      v:019: 'WIS:11:19 | 19 | 19 | Or unknown beasts of a new kind, full of rage: either breathing out a fiery vapour, or sending forth a stinking smoke, or shooting horrible sparks out of their eyes:'
      v:020: 'WIS:11:20 | 20 | 20 | Whereof not only the hurt might be able to destroy them, but also the very sight might kill them through fear.'
      v:021: 'WIS:11:21 | 21 | 21 | Yea and without these, they might have been slain with one blast, persecuted by their own deeds, and scattered by the breath of thy power: but thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight.'
      v:022: 'WIS:11:22 | 22 | 22 | For great power always belonged to thee alone: and who shall resist the strength of thy arm?'
      v:023: 'WIS:11:23 | 23 | 23 | For the whole world before thee is as the least grain of the balance, and as a drop of the morning dew, that falleth down upon the earth.'

      v:025: 'WIS:11:25 | 25 | 25 | For thou lovest all things that are, and hatest none of the things which thou hast made: for thou didst not appoint, or make any thing hating it.'

      v:010: 'WIS:12:10 | 10 | 10 | But executing thy judgments by degrees thou gavest them place of repentance, not being ignorant that they were a wicked generation, and their malice natural, and that their thought could never be changed.'
      v:011: 'WIS:12:11 | 11 | 11 | For it was a cursed seed from the beginning: neither didst thou for fear of any one give pardon to their sins.'
      v:012: 'WIS:12:12 | 12 | 12 | For who shall say to thee: What hast thou done? or who shall withstand thy judgment? or who shall come before thee to be a revenger of wicked men? or who shall accuse thee, if the nations perish, which thou hast made ?'

      v:001: 'WIS:13:1 | 1 | 1 | But  all men are vain, in whom there is not the knowledge of God: and who by these good things that are seen, could not understand him that is, neither by attending to the works have acknowledged who was the workman:'
      v:002: 'WIS:13:2 | 2 | 2 | But have imagined either the fire, or the wind, or the swift air, or the circle of the stars, or the great water, or the sun and moon, to be the gods that rule the world.'
      v:003: 'WIS:13:3 | 3 | 3 | With whose beauty, if they, being delighted, took them to be gods: let them know how much the Lord of them is more beautiful than they: for the first author of beauty made all those things.'
      v:004: 'WIS:13:4 | 4 | 4 | Or if they admired their power and their effects, let them understand by them, that he that made them, is mightier than they:'
      v:005: 'WIS:13:5 | 5 | 5 | For by the greatness of the beauty, and of the creature, the creator of them may be seen, so as to be known thereby.'
      v:006: 'WIS:13:6 | 6 | 6 | But yet as to these they are less to be blamed. For they perhaps err, seeking God, and desirous to find him.'
      v:007: 'WIS:13:7 | 7 | 7 | For being conversant among his works, they search: and they are persuaded that the things are good which are seen.'
      v:008: WIS:13:8 | 8 | 8 | But then again they are not to be pardoned.
      v:009: 'WIS:13:9 | 9 | 9 | For if they were able to know so much as to make a judgment of the world: how did they not more easily find out the Lord thereof?'
      v:010: 'WIS:13:10 | 10 | 10 | But unhappy are they, and their hope is among the dead, who have called gods the works of the hands of men, gold and silver, the inventions of art, and the resemblances of beasts, or an unprofitable stone the work of an ancient hand.'
      v:011: 'WIS:13:11 | 11 | 11 | Or if an artist, a carpenter, hath cut down a tree proper for his use in the wood, and skilfully taken off all the bark thereof, and with his art, diligently formeth a vessel profitable for the common uses of life,'
      v:012: 'WIS:13:12 | 12 | 12 | And useth the chips of his work to dress his meat:'

      v:002: 'WIS:14:2 | 2 | 2 | For this the desire of gain devised, and the workman built it by his skill.'
      v:003: 'WIS:14:3 | 3 | 3 | But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way even in the sea, and a most sure path among the waves,'

      v:005: 'WIS:14:5 | 5 | 5 | But that the works of thy wisdom might not be idle: therefore men also trust their lives even to a little wood, and passing over the sea by ship are saved.'
      v:006: 'WIS:14:6 | 6 | 6 | And from the beginning also when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world fleeing to a vessel, which was governed by thy hand, left to the world seed of generation.'

      v:008: 'WIS:14:8 | 8 | 8 | But the idol that is made by hands, is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he because he made it; and it because being frail it is called a god.'
      v:009: WIS:14:9 | 9 | 9 | But to God the wicked and his wickedness are hateful alike.
      v:010: 'WIS:14:10 | 10 | 10 | For that which is made, together with him that made it, shall suffer torments.'
      v:011: 'WIS:14:11 | 11 | 11 | Therefore there shall be no respect had even to the idols of the Gentiles: because the creatures of God are turned to an abomination, and a temptation to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise.'
      v:012: 'WIS:14:12 | 12 | 12 | For the beginning of fornication is the devising of idols: and the invention of them is the corruption of life.'
      v:013: 'WIS:14:13 | 13 | 13 | For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever.'
      v:014: 'WIS:14:14 | 14 | 14 | For by the vanity of men they came into the world: and therefore they shall be found to come shortly to an end.'
      v:015: 'WIS:14:15 | 15 | 15 | For a father being afflicted with bitter grief, made to himself the image of his son who was quickly taken away: and him who then had died as a man, he began now to worship as a god, and appointed him rites and sacrifices among his servants.'
      v:016: 'WIS:14:16 | 16 | 16 | Then in process of time, wicked custom prevailing, this error was kept as a law, and statues were worshipped by the commandment of tyrants.'
      v:017: 'WIS:14:17 | 17 | 17 | And those whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they brought their resemblance from afar, and made an express image of the king whom they had a mind to honour: that by this their diligence, they might honour as present, him that was absent.'
      v:018: 'WIS:14:18 | 18 | 18 | And to the worshipping of these, the singular diligence also of the artificer helped to set forward the ignorant.'
      v:019: 'WIS:14:19 | 19 | 19 | For he being willing to please him that employed him, laboured with all his art to make the resemblance in the best manner.'
      v:020: 'WIS:14:20 | 20 | 20 | And the multitude of men, carried away by the beauty of the work, took him now for a god that a little before was but honoured as a man.'
      v:021: 'WIS:14:21 | 21 | 21 | And this was the occasion of deceiving human life: for men serving either their affection, or their kings, gave the incommunicable name to stones and wood.'
      v:022: 'WIS:14:22 | 22 | 22 | And it was not enough for them to err about the knowledge of God, but whereas they lived in a great war of ignorance, they call so many and so great evils peace.'
      v:023: 'WIS:14:23 | 23 | 23 | For either they sacrifice their own children, or use hidden sacrifices, or keep watches full of madness,'
      v:024: 'WIS:14:24 | 24 | 24 | So that now they neither keep life, nor marriage undefiled, but one killeth another through envy, or grieveth him by adultery:'
      v:025: 'WIS:14:25 | 25 | 25 | And all things are mingled together, blood, murder, theft and dissimulation, corruption and unfaithfulness, tumults and perjury, disquieting of the good,'
      v:026: 'WIS:14:26 | 26 | 26 | Forgetfulness of God, defiling of souls, changing of nature, disorder in marriage, and the irregularity of adultery and uncleanness.'
      v:027: 'WIS:14:27 | 27 | 27 | For the worship of abominable idols is the cause, and the beginning and end of all evil.'
      v:028: 'WIS:14:28 | 28 | 28 | For either they are mad when they are merry: or they prophesy lies, or they live unjustly, or easily forswear themselves.'
      v:029: 'WIS:14:29 | 29 | 29 | For whilst they trust in idols, which are without life, though they swear amiss, they look not to be hurt.'
      v:030: 'WIS:14:30 | 30 | 30 | But for two things they shall be justly punished, because they have thought not well of God, giving heed to idols, and have sworn unjustly, in guile despising justice.'
      v:031: 'WIS:14:31 | 31 | 31 | For it is not the power of them, by whom they swear, but the just vengeance of sinners always punisheth the transgression of the unjust.'

    verses:
      v:001: 'WIS:16:1 | 1 | 1 | For  these things, and by the like things to these, they were worthily punished, and were destroyed by a multitude of beasts.'
      v:002: 'WIS:16:2 | 2 | 2 | Instead of which punishment, dealing well with thy people, thou gavest them their desire of delicious food, of a new taste, preparing for them quails for their meat:'
      v:003: 'WIS:16:3 | 3 | 3 | To the end that {1 they indeed desiring food}, by means of those things that were shewn and sent among them, might loathe even that which was necessary to satisfy their desire. {2 But these}, after suffering want for a short time, tasted a new meat.'
      v:004: 'WIS:16:4 | 4 | 4 | For it was requisite that inevitable destruction should come upon them that exercised tyranny: but to these it should only be shewn how their enemies were destroyed.'
      v:005: 'WIS:16:5 | 5 | 5 | For when the fierce rage of beasts came upon these, they were destroyed with the bitings of crooked serpents.'
      v:006: 'WIS:16:6 | 6 | 6 | But thy wrath endured not for ever, but they were troubled for a short time for their correction, having a {3 sign of salvation} to put them in remembrance of the commandment of thy law.'
      v:007: 'WIS:16:7 | 7 | 7 | For he that turned to it, was not healed by that which he saw, but by thee the Saviour of all.'
      v:008: 'WIS:16:8 | 8 | 8 | And in this thou didst shew to our enemies, that thou art he who deliverest from all evil.'
      v:009: 'WIS:16:9 | 9 | 9 | For the bitings of locusts, and of flies killed them, and there was found no remedy for their life: because they were worthy to be destroyed by such things.'
      v:010: 'WIS:16:10 | 10 | 10 | But not even the teeth of venomous serpents overcame thy children: for thy mercy came and healed them.'
      v:011: 'WIS:16:11 | 11 | 11 | For they were examined for the remembrance of thy words, and were quickly healed, lest falling into deep forgetfulness, they might not be able to use thy help.'
      v:012: 'WIS:16:12 | 12 | 12 | For it was neither herb, nor mollifying plaster that healed them, but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.'
      v:013: 'WIS:16:13 | 13 | 13 | For it is thou, O Lord, that hast power of life and death, and leadest down to the gates of death, and bringest back again:'
      v:014: 'WIS:16:14 | 14 | 14 | A man indeed killeth through malice, and when the spirit is gone forth, it shall not return, neither shall he call back the soul that is received:'
      v:015: WIS:16:15 | 15 | 15 | But it is impossible to escape thy hand.
      v:016: 'WIS:16:16 | 16 | 16 | For the wicked that denied to know thee, were scourged by the strength of thy arm, being persecuted by strange waters, and hail, and rain, and consumed by fire.'
      v:017: 'WIS:16:17 | 17 | 17 | And which was wonderful, in water, which extinguisheth all things, {4 the fire had more force}: for the world fighteth for the just.'
      v:018: 'WIS:16:18 | 18 | 18 | For at one time, the fire was mitigated, that the beasts which were sent against the wicked might not be burned, but that they might see and perceive that they were persecuted by the judgment of God.'
      v:019: 'WIS:16:19 | 19 | 19 | And at another time the fire, above its own power, burned in the midst of water, to destroy the fruits of a wicked land.'
      v:020: 'WIS:16:20 | 20 | 20 | Instead of which things thou didst feed thy people with the food of angels, and gavest them bread from heaven prepared without labour; having in it all that is delicious, and the sweetness of every taste.'
      v:021: "WIS:16:21 | 21 | 21 | For thy sustenance shewed thy sweetness to thy children, and serving every man''s will, it was turned to what every man liked."
      v:022: 'WIS:16:22 | 22 | 22 | But snow and ice endured the force of fire, and melted not: that they might know that fire burning in the hail and flashing in the rain destroyed the fruits of the enemies.'
      v:023: 'WIS:16:23 | 23 | 23 | But this same again, that the just might be nourished, did even forget its own strength.'
      v:024: 'WIS:16:24 | 24 | 24 | For the creature serving thee the Creator, is made fierce against the unjust for their punishment; and abateth its strength for the benefit of them that trust in thee.'
      v:025: 'WIS:16:25 | 25 | 25 | Therefore even then it was transformed into all things, and was obedient to thy grace that nourisheth all, according to the will of them that desired it of thee:'
      v:026: 'WIS:16:26 | 26 | 26 | That thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovedst, might know that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth men, but thy word preserveth them that believe in thee.'
      v:027: 'WIS:16:27 | 27 | 27 | For that which could not be destroyed by fire, being warmed with a little sunbeam presently melted away:'
      v:028: 'WIS:16:28 | 28 | 28 | That it might be known to all, that we ought to prevent the sun to bless thee, and adore thee at the dawning of the light.'
      v:029: "WIS:16:29 | 29 | 29 | For the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as the winter''s ice, and shall run off as unprofitable water."

    verses:
      v:001: 'WIS:17:1 | 1 | 1 | For  thy judgments, O Lord, are great, and thy words cannot be expressed: therefore undisciplined souls have erred.'
      v:002: 'WIS:17:2 | 2 | 2 | For while the wicked thought to be able to have dominion over the holy nation, they themselves being fettered with the bonds of darkness, and a long night, shut up in their houses, lay there exiled from the eternal providence.'
      v:003: 'WIS:17:3 | 3 | 3 | And while they thought to lie hid in their obscure sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly afraid and troubled with exceeding great astonishment.'
      v:004: 'WIS:17:4 | 4 | 4 | For neither did the den that held them, keep them from fear: for noises coming down troubled them, and sad visions appearing to them, affrighted them.'
      v:005: 'WIS:17:5 | 5 | 5 | And no power of fire could give them light, neither could the bright flames of the stars enlighten that horrible night.'
      v:006: 'WIS:17:6 | 6 | 6 | But there appeared to them a sudden fire, very dreadful: and being struck with the fear of that face, which was not seen, they thought the things which they saw to be worse:'
      v:007: 'WIS:17:7 | 7 | 7 | And the delusions of their magic art were put down, and their boasting of wisdom was reproachfully rebuked.'
      v:008: 'WIS:17:8 | 8 | 8 | For they who promised to drive away fears and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of a fear worthy to be laughed at.'
      v:009: 'WIS:17:9 | 9 | 9 | For though no terrible thing disturbed them: yet being scared with the passing by of beasts, and hissing of serpents, they died for fear: and denying that they saw the air, which could by no means be avoided.'
      v:010: 'WIS:17:10 | 10 | 10 | For whereas wickedness is fearful, it beareth witness of its condemnation: for a troubled conscience always forecasteth grievous things.'
      v:011: WIS:17:11 | 11 | 11 | For fear is nothing else but a yielding up of the succours from thought.
      v:012: 'WIS:17:12 | 12 | 12 | And while there is less expectation from within, the greater doth it count the ignorance of that cause which bringeth the torment.'
      v:013: 'WIS:17:13 | 13 | 13 | But they that during that night, in which nothing could be done, and which came upon them from the lowest and deepest hell, slept the same sleep,'
      v:014: 'WIS:17:14 | 14 | 14 | Were sometimes molested with the fear of monsters, sometimes fainted away, their soul failing them: for a sudden and unlooked for fear was come upon them.'
      v:015: 'WIS:17:15 | 15 | 15 | Moreover if any of them had fallen down, he was kept shut up in prison without irons.'
      v:016: 'WIS:17:16 | 16 | 16 | For if any one were a husbandman, or a shepherd, or a labourer in the field, and was suddenly overtaken, he endured a necessity from which he could not fly.'
      v:017: 'WIS:17:17 | 17 | 17 | For they were all bound together with one chain of darkness. Whether it were a whistling wind, or the melodious voice of birds, among the spreading branches of trees, or a fall of water running down with violence,'
      v:018: 'WIS:17:18 | 18 | 18 | Or the mighty noise of stones tumbling down, or the running that could not be seen of beasts playing together, or the roaring voice of wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the highest mountains: these things made them to swoon for fear.'
      v:019: 'WIS:17:19 | 19 | 19 | For the whole world was enlightened with a clear light, and none were hindered in their labours.'
      v:020: 'WIS:17:20 | 20 | 20 | But over them only was spread a heavy night, an image of that darkness which was to come upon them. But they were to themselves more grievous than the darkness.'

    verses:
      v:001: 'WIS:18:1 | 1 | 1 | But  thy saints had a very great light, and they heard their voice indeed, but did not see their shape. And because they also did not suffer the same things, they glorified thee:'
      v:002: 'WIS:18:2 | 2 | 2 | And they that before had been wronged, gave thanks, because they were not hurt now: and asked this gift, that there might be a difference.'
      v:003: 'WIS:18:3 | 3 | 3 | Therefore they received a burning pillar of fire for a guide of the way which they knew not, and thou gavest them {1 a harmless sun} of a good entertainment.'
      v:004: 'WIS:18:4 | 4 | 4 | The others indeed were worthy to be deprived of light, and imprisoned in darkness, who kept thy children shut up, by whom the pure light of the law was to be given to the world.'
      v:005: 'WIS:18:5 | 5 | 5 | And whereas they thought to kill the babes of the just, {2 one child} being cast forth, and saved, to reprove them, thou tookest away a multitude of their children, and destroyedst them all together in a mighty water.'
      v:006: 'WIS:18:6 | 6 | 6 | For that night was known before by our fathers, that assuredly knowing what oaths they had trusted to, they might be of better courage.'
      v:007: 'WIS:18:7 | 7 | 7 | So thy people received the salvation of the just, and destruction of the unjust.'
      v:008: 'WIS:18:8 | 8 | 8 | For as thou didst punish the adversaries: so thou didst also encourage and glorify us.'
      v:009: 'WIS:18:9 | 9 | 9 | For the just children {3 of good men} were offering sacrifice secretly, and they unanimously ordered a law of justice: that the just should receive both good and evil alike, singing now the praises of the fathers.'
      v:010: 'WIS:18:10 | 10 | 10 | But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable mourning was heard for the children that were bewailed.'
      v:011: 'WIS:18:11 | 11 | 11 | And the servant suffered the same punishment as the master, and a common man suffered in like manner as the king.'
      v:012: 'WIS:18:12 | 12 | 12 | So all alike had innumerable dead, with one kind of death. Neither were the living sufficient to bury them; for in one moment {4 the noblest offspring} of them was destroyed.'
      v:013: 'WIS:18:13 | 13 | 13 | For whereas they would not believe any thing before by reason of the enchantments, then first upon the destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged the people to be of God.'

      v:017: 'WIS:18:17 | 17 | 17 | Then suddenly visions of evil dreams troubled them, and fears unlooked for came upon them.'

      v:019: 'WIS:18:19 | 19 | 19 | For the visions that troubled them foreshewed these things, lest they should perish and not know why they suffered these evils.'
      v:020: 'WIS:18:20 | 20 | 20 | But the just also were afterwards touched by an assault of death, and there was a disturbance of the multitude in the wilderness: but thy wrath did not long continue.'
      v:021: 'WIS:18:21 | 21 | 21 | For a blameless man made haste to pray for the people, bringing forth the shield of his ministry, prayer, and by incense making supplication, withstood the wrath, and put an end to the calamity, shewing that he was thy servant.'
      v:022: 'WIS:18:22 | 22 | 22 | And he overcame the disturbance, not by strength of body nor with force of arms, but with a word he subdued him that punished them, alleging the oaths and covenant made with the fathers.'
      v:023: 'WIS:18:23 | 23 | 23 | For when they were now fallen down dead by heaps one upon another, he stood between and stayed the assault, and cut off the way to the living.'

      v:001: 'WIS:19:1 | 1 | 1 | But  as to the wicked, even to the end there came upon them wrath without mercy. For he knew before also what they would do:'
      v:002: 'WIS:19:2 | 2 | 2 | For when they had given them leave to depart, and had sent them away with great care, they repented, and pursued after them.'
      v:003: 'WIS:19:3 | 3 | 3 | For whilst they were yet mourning, and lamenting at the graves of the dead, they took up another foolish device: and pursued them as fugitives whom they had pressed to be gone:'
      v:004: 'WIS:19:4 | 4 | 4 | For a necessity, of which they were worthy, brought them to this end: and they lost the remembrance of those things which had happened, that their punishment might fill up what was wanting to their torments:'
      v:005: 'WIS:19:5 | 5 | 5 | And that thy people might wonderfully pass through, but they might find a new death.'
      v:006: 'WIS:19:6 | 6 | 6 | For every creature according to its kind was fashioned again as from the beginning, obeying thy commandments, that thy children might be kept without hurt.'

      v:009: 'WIS:19:9 | 9 | 9 | For they fed on their food like horses, and they skipped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.'
      v:010: 'WIS:19:10 | 10 | 10 | For they were yet mindful of those things which had been done in the time of their sojourning, how the ground brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of fishes.'
      v:011: 'WIS:19:11 | 11 | 11 | And at length they saw a new generation of birds, when being led by their appetite they asked for delicate meats.'
      v:012: 'WIS:19:12 | 12 | 12 | For to satisfy their desire, the quail came up to them from the sea: and punishments came upon the sinners, not without foregoing signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness.'
      v:013: 'WIS:19:13 | 13 | 13 | For they exercised a more detestable inhospitality than any: others indeed received not strangers unknown to them, but these brought their guests into bondage that had deserved well of them.'
      v:014: 'WIS:19:14 | 14 | 14 | And not only so, but in another respect also they were worse: for the others against their will received the strangers.'
