      v:001: '1JN:2:1 | 1 | 1 | My  little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just:'
      v:002: '1JN:2:2 | 2 | 2 | And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.'
      v:003: '1JN:2:3 | 3 | 3 | And by this we know that {1 we have known him, if we keep his commandments.}'
      v:004: '1JN:2:4 | 4 | 4 | He who saith that he knoweth him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.'
      v:005: '1JN:2:5 | 5 | 5 | But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of God is perfected; and by this we know that we are in him.'
      v:006: '1JN:2:6 | 6 | 6 | He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also to walk, even as he walked.'
      v:007: '1JN:2:7 | 7 | 7 | Dearly beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard.'
      v:008: '1JN:2:8 | 8 | 8 | Again {2 a new commandment} I write unto you, which thing is true both in him and in you; because the darkness is passed, and the true light now shineth.'
      v:009: '1JN:2:9 | 9 | 9 | He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.'
      v:010: '1JN:2:10 | 10 | 10 | He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is no scandal in him.'
      v:011: '1JN:2:11 | 11 | 11 | But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth; because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.'
      v:012: "1JN:2:12 | 12 | 12 | I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name''s sake."
      v:013: '1JN:2:13 | 13 | 13 | I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him, who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one.'
      v:014: '1JN:2:14 | 14 | 14 | I write unto you, babes, because you have known the Father. I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.'
      v:015: '1JN:2:15 | 15 | 15 | Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.'
      v:016: '1JN:2:16 | 16 | 16 | For all that is in the world, is the concupiscence of the flesh, and the concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not of the Father, but is of the world.'

      v:019: '1JN:2:19 | 19 | 19 | They went out from us, but {5 they were not of us}. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us; but that they may be manifest, that they are not all of us.'
      v:020: '1JN:2:20 | 20 | 20 | But you have {6 the unction from the Holy One}, and {7 know all things}.'
      v:021: '1JN:2:21 | 21 | 21 | I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but as to them that know it: and that no lie is of the truth.'
      v:022: '1JN:2:22 | 22 | 22 | Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist, who denieth the Father, and the Son.'
      v:023: '1JN:2:23 | 23 | 23 | Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. He that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also.'
      v:024: '1JN:2:24 | 24 | 24 | As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning, abide in you. If that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning, you also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father.'
      v:025: '1JN:2:25 | 25 | 25 | And this is the promise which he hath promised us, life everlasting.'
      v:026: '1JN:2:26 | 26 | 26 | These things have I written to you, concerning them that seduce you.'
      v:027: '1JN:2:27 | 27 | 27 | And as for you, let the unction, which you have received from him, abide in you. And {8 you have no need} that any man teach you; but as his unction teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide in him.'
      v:028: '1JN:2:28 | 28 | 28 | And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be confounded by him at his coming.'
      v:029: '1JN:2:29 | 29 | 29 | If you know, that he is just, know ye, that every one also, who doth justice, is born of him.'

      v:001: '1JN:3:1 | 1 | 1 | Behold  what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called, and should be the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth not us, because it knew not him.'
      v:002: '1JN:3:2 | 2 | 2 | Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God; and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know, that, when he shall appear, we shall be like to him: because we shall see him as he is.'
      v:003: '1JN:3:3 | 3 | 3 | And every one that hath this hope in him, sanctifieth himself, as he also is holy.'

      v:007: '1JN:3:7 | 7 | 7 | Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doth justice is just, even as he is just.'
      v:008: '1JN:3:8 | 8 | 8 | He that committeth sin is of the devil: for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose, the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the works of the devil.'
      v:009: '1JN:3:9 | 9 | 9 | Whosoever is born of God, {3 committeth not sin}: for his seed abideth in him, and he can not sin, because he is born of God.'
      v:010: '1JN:3:10 | 10 | 10 | In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever is not just, is not of God, nor he that loveth not his brother.'
      v:011: '1JN:3:11 | 11 | 11 | For this is the declaration, which you have heard from the beginning, that you should love one another.'
      v:012: "1JN:3:12 | 12 | 12 | Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and killed his brother. And wherefore did he kill him? Because his own works were wicked: and his brother''s just."

        caption: Try the spirits.
        content: 'Viz., by examining whether their teaching be agreeable to the rule of the Catholic faith, and the doctrine of the church. For as he says, (ver. 6,) <i>He that knoweth God, heareth us</i> [the pastors of the church]. <i>By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</i>'
      2:
        caption: 'Every spirit which confesseth, &c.'
        content: 'Not that the confession of this point of faith alone, is, at all times, and in all cases, sufficient; but that with relation to that time, and for that part of the Christian doctrine, which was then particularly to be confessed, taught, and maintained against the heretics of those days, this was the most proper token, by which the true teachers might be distinguished from the false.'

        content: 'Viz., either by denying his humanity, or his divinity.'

        content: 'Not in his person, but in his spirit, and in his precursors.'
      5:
        caption: 'Fear is not in charity, &c.'
        content: "Perfect charity, or love, banisheth <i>human fear,</i> that is, the fear of men; as also all <i>perplexing fear,</i> which makes men mistrust or despair of God''s mercy; and that kind of <i>servile fear,</i> which makes them fear the punishment of sin more than the offence offered to God. But it no way excludes the wholesome <i>fear of God''s judgments,</i> so often recomended in holy writ; nor that <i>fear and trembling,</i> with which we are told to work out our salvation. Phil. 2. 12."

        content: "<i>He is, or this is the true God, and life eternal.</i> Which words are a clear proof of Christ''s divinity, and as such made use of by the ancient fathers."
      12:
        caption: Keep yourselves from idols.
        content: 'An admonition to the newly converted Christians, lest conversing with heathens and idolaters, they might fall back into the sin of idolatry, which may be the sin unto death here mentioned by St. John.'
      2:
        caption: Is born of God.
        content: "That is, is justified, and become a child of God by baptism: which is also to be understood; provided the belief of this fundamental article of the Christian faith be accompanied with all the other conditions, which, by the word of God, and his appointment, are also required to justification; such as a general belief of all that God has revealed and promised: hope, love, repentance, and a sincere disposition to keep God''s holy law and commandments."
      3:
        caption: Our faith.
        content: 'Not a bare, speculative, or dead faith; but a <i>faith that worketh by charity.</i> Gal. 5. 6'
      4:
        caption: Came by water and blood.
        content: 'Not only to wash away our sins by the <i>water</i> of baptism, but by his own <i>blood.</i>'
      5:
        caption: 'The spirit, and the water, and the blood.'
        content: "As the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, all bear witness to Christ''s divinity; so the <i>spirit,</i> which he yielded up, crying out with a loud voice upon the cross; and the water and blood that issued from his side, bear witness to his humanity, and <i>are one</i>; that is, all agree in one testimony."
      6:
        caption: 'He that believeth not the Son, &c.'
        content: 'By refusing to believe the testimonies given by the three divine persons, that Jesus was the Messias, and the true Son of God, by whom eternal <i>life</i> is obtained and promised to all that comply with his doctrine. In him we have also this lively <i>confidence,</i> that we shall obtain whatever we ask, according to his will, when we ask what is for our good, with perseverance, and in the manner we ought. And this we <i>know,</i> and have experience of, by having obtained the <i>petitions</i> that we have made.'
      7:
        caption: 'A sin which is not to death, &c.'
        content: "It is hard to determine what St. John here calls a sin, <i>which is not to death,</i> and a sin which is <i>unto death.</i> The difference can not be the same as betwixt sins that are called <i>venial and mortal:</i> for he says, that if a man pray for his brother, who commits a sin that <i>is not to death, life shall be given him:</i> therefore such a one had before lost the life of grace, and been guilty of what is commonly called a mortal sin. And when he speaks of a sin that is <i>unto death,</i> and adds these words, <i>for that I say not that any man ask,</i> it cannot be supposed that St. John would say this of every mortal sin, but only of some heinous sins, which are very seldom remitted, because such sinners very seldom repent. <i>By a sin</i> therefore <i>which is unto death,</i> interpreters commonly under-stand a wilfull apostasy from the faith, and from the known truth, when a sinner, hardened by his own ingratitude, becomes deaf to all admonitions, will do nothing for himself, but runs on to a final impenitence. Nor yet does St. John say, that such a sin is never remitted, or can not be remitted, but only has these words, <i>for that I say not that any man ask</i> the remission : that is, though we must pray for all sinners whatsoever, yet men can not pray for such sinners with such a <i>confidence</i> of obtaining always their <i>petitions,</i> as St. John said before, ver. 14.<br>Whatever exposition we follow on this verse, our faith teacheth us from the holy scriptures, that <i>God desires not the death</i> of any sinner, but that he be <i>converted and live,</i> Ezech. 33. 11. Though men''s <i>sins be as red as scarlet, they shall become as white as snow,</i> Isa. 3. 18. It <i>is the will of God that every one come to the knowledge of the truth,</i> and <i>be saved.</i> There is no sin so great but which God is willing to forgive, and has left a power in his church to remit the most enormous sins: so that no sinner need despair of pardon, nor will any sinner perish, but by his own fault."
      8:
        caption: A sin unto death.
        content: 'Some understand this of <i>final impenitence,</i> or of dying in mortal sin; which is the only sin that never can be remitted. But, it is probable, he may also comprise under this name, the sin of apostasy from the faith, and some other such heinous sins as are seldom and hardly remitted: and therefore he gives little encouragement, to such as pray for these sinners, to expect what they ask.'
      9:
        caption: 'And the whole world is seated in wickedness:'
        content: 'that is, a great part of the world. It may also signify, <i>is under the wicked one,</i> meaning the devil, who is elsewhere called the prince of this world, that is, of all the wicked. John 12. 31.'
