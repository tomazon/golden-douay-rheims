    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'RUT:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Of one.</i> Hebrew, "And it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled." (Haydock) --- The <i>and</i> shews the connection with the former book. (Calmet) --- <i>Land.</i> Chaldean adds, "of Israel," (Menochius) while the less fertile country of Moab had abundance. God thus punished the idolatry of his people. Some say the famine lasted ten years; but this is uncertain, though Noemi continued so long out of the country, ver. 4. (Salien)'
      v:002:
        - 'RUT:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Elimelech</i>. Josephus and others read erroneously, Abimelech. He was probably called also Jokim, 1 Paralipomenon iv. 22. --- <i>Ephrathites.</i> This title often designates people of the tribe of Ephraim; (Judges xii. 5., and 1 Kings i. 2,) but here it means those of Ephrata, which is also called Bethlehem of Juda, about five or six miles south of Jerusalem, Genesis xxxv. 19., and Micheas v. 2. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - 'RUT:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Ruth</i> was the wife of Mahalon; (chap. iv. 10,) and signifies one "well watered, (Menochius) or inebriated," &c. (Haydock) --- The sons of Noemi were excused by necessity in marrying idolaters, though they ought to have done their best to convert them. The Chaldean greatly condemns their marriage, and thinks that their death was in punishment of their prevarication, Deuteronomy vii. 3. and xx. 11. (Calmet) --- Salien is of the same opinion. So various have always been the sentiments of people on this head! (Haydock) See Serarius, q. 11.'
      v:008:
        - 'RUT:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Mothers,</i> who had separate apartments from the men. (Calmet) --- <i>Me.</i> They had behaved with great respect and love towards their husbands, and towards Noemi, whom they even wish to accompany. (Menochius) --- The pronouns in this, and verses 9, 11, 13, and 19, are surprisingly corrupted in Hebrew being masculine or feminine, where we should expect the contrary. (Kennicott)'
      v:009:
        - 'RUT:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Take.</i> She proposes marriage to them, as a state more suitable to their years, (Haydock) and wishes that they may experience none of its solicitudes, (1 Corinthians vii. 28,) but be constantly protected by their husbands. Widows are exposed to many difficulties. (Menochius)'
      v:011:
        - 'RUT:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Of me.</i> Hence it appears that the Rabbins are under a mistake, when they say that those children who are born after the death of their brothers, are not obliged to take their widows.'
      v:013:
        - 'RUT:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Marry.</i> Hebrew, "would you stay for them from having husbands?"'
      v:014:
        - 'RUT:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>And returned,</i> is not expressed in Hebrew. But the Septuagint have, "and she returned to her people." (Haydock).'
      v:015:
        - 'RUT:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>To her gods,</i> &c. Noemi did not mean to persuade Ruth to return to the false gods she had formerly worshipped; but by this manner of speech, insinuated to her, that if she would go with her, she must renounce her false gods, and turn to the Lord, the God of Israel. (Challoner) --- She wished to try her constancy. (Salien) --- Most infer from this passage, that Orpha was never converted, or that she relapsed. --- <i>Her gods,</i> may indeed be rendered in the singular, "god." But what god was peculiar to her and the Moabites, but Chamos? (Calmet) --- Noemi might well fear that Orpha would give way to the superstition of her countrymen, to which she had been addicted, even though she might have made profession of serving the true God, while she lived with her. (Haydock).'
      v:017:
        - 'RUT:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>The Lord do so and so,</i> &c. A form of swearing usual in the history of the Old Testament, by which the person wished such and such evils to fall upon them, if they did not do what they said. (Challoner) --- It is not certain that they expressed what particular evils. (Calmet) --- They might be willing to undergo any punishment, if they should transgress. (Haydock) --- The pagans used a similar form of imprecation, 3 Kings xix., and 4 Kings xx. 10. (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - 'RUT:1:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>That Noemi.</i> This exclamation might proceed either from surprise, or from contempt. (Menochius)'
      v:020:
        - 'RUT:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>That is.</i> The explanations are added by St. Jerome. (Haydock) --- Noemi had formerly a husband and two sons, with great riches, of which she was now deprived. (Worthington)'
      v:021:
        - 'RUT:1:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Almighty.</i> Hebrew <i>Sadai,</i> ("the self-sufficient) hath afflicted."'
      v:022:
        - 'RUT:1:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Harvest.</i> About the month of Nisan, or our March (Calmet) and April. (Menochius)'

    verses:
      v:001: 'RUT:1:1 | 1 | 1 | In the {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}days of one of the judges, when the judges ruled, there came a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem Juda, went to sojourn in the land of Moab with his wife and his two sons.'
      v:002: 'RUT:1:2 | 2 | 2 | He was named Elimelech, and his wife, Noemi: and his two sons, the one Mahalon, and the other Chelion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Juda. And entering into the country of Moab, they abode there.'
      v:003: 'RUT:1:3 | 3 | 3 | And Elimelech the husband of Noemi died: and she remained with her sons.'
      v:004: 'RUT:1:4 | 4 | 4 | And they took wives of the women of Moab, of which one was called Orpha, and the other Ruth. And they dwelt there ten years,'
      v:005: 'RUT:1:5 | 5 | 5 | And they both died, to wit, Mahalon and Chelion: and the woman was left alone, having lost both her sons and her husband.'
      v:006: 'RUT:1:6 | 6 | 6 | And she arose to go from the land of Moab to her own country, with both her daughters-in-law: for she had heard that the Lord had looked upon his people, and had given them food.'
      v:007: 'RUT:1:7 | 7 | 7 | Wherefore she went forth out of the place of her sojournment, with both her daughters-in-law: and being now in the way to return into the land of Juda,'
      v:008: 'RUT:1:8 | 8 | 8 | She said to them: Go ye home to your mothers, the Lord deal mercifully with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me.'
      v:009: 'RUT:1:9 | 9 | 9 | May he grant you to find rest in the houses of the husbands which you shall take. And she kissed them. And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep,'
      v:010: 'RUT:1:10 | 10 | 10 | And to say: We will go on with thee to thy people.'
      v:011: 'RUT:1:11 | 11 | 11 | But she answered them: Return, my daughters, why come ye with me? have I any more sons in my womb, that you may hope for husbands of me?'
      v:012: 'RUT:1:12 | 12 | 12 | Return again, my daughters, and go your ways: for I am now spent with age, and not fit for wedlock. Although I might conceive this night, and bear children,'
      v:013: "RUT:1:13 | 13 | 13 | If you would wait till they were grown up, and come to man's estate, you would be old women before you marry. Do not so, my daughters, I beseech you: for I am grieved the more for your distress, and the hand of the Lord is gone out against me."
      v:014: 'RUT:1:14 | 14 | 14 | And they lifted up their voice, and began to weep again: Orpha kissed her mother-in-law and returned: Ruth stuck close to her mother-in-law.'
      v:015: 'RUT:1:15 | 15 | 15 | And Noemi said to her: Behold thy kinswoman is returned to her people, and to her gods, go thou with her.'
      v:016: 'RUT:1:16 | 16 | 16 | She answered: Be not against me, to desire that I should leave thee and depart: for whithersoever thou shalt go, I will go: and where thou shalt dwell, I also will dwell. Thy people <i>shall be</i> my people, and thy God my God.'
      v:017: 'RUT:1:17 | 17 | 17 | The land that shall receive thee dying, in the same will I die: and there will I be buried. The Lord do so and so to me, and add more also, if ought but death part me and thee.'
      v:018: 'RUT:1:18 | 18 | 18 | Then Noemi seeing that Ruth was steadfastly determined to go with her, would not be against it, nor persuade her any more to return to her friends:'
      v:019: 'RUT:1:19 | 19 | 19 | So they went together, and came to Bethlehem. And when they were come into the city, the report was quickly spread among all: and the women said: This is that Noemi.'
      v:020: 'RUT:1:20 | 20 | 20 | But she said to them: Call me not Noemi (that is, beautiful), but call me Mara (that is, bitter), for the Almighty hath quite filled me with bitterness.'
      v:021: 'RUT:1:21 | 21 | 21 | I went out full, and the Lord hath brought me back empty. Why then do you call me Noemi, whom the Lord hath humbled, and the Almighty hath afflicted?'
      v:022: 'RUT:1:22 | 22 | 22 | So Noemi came with Ruth, the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, from the land of her sojournment: and returned into Bethlehem, in the beginning of the barley harvest.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'RUT:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Booz.</i> The Scripture does not specify how nearly they were related. Rabbi Josue says Elimelech, Salmon, and Tob (chap. iii. 13,) were brothers, and Booz was the son of Salmon, which cannot be refuted, (Serar. q. 1.; Menochius) though the authority and proofs be very weak. It is not, however, more probable that Booz was the <i>brother</i> of Elimelech. Some think that he was not the immediate son of Salmon, as four persons seem too few to fill up the space of 366 years, from the marriage of Rahab till the birth of David. But this is not impossible. (Calmet) See chap. iv. 20.'
      v:002:
        - 'RUT:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>To me.</i> It was the privilege of the poor and of strangers to glean, Deuteronomy xxiv. 19., and Leviticus xix. 9. Yet Ruth asks leave, through civility. (Calmet) --- This law is no longer in force, but it would be inhuman for the rich to deny this liberty to those who are in distress, and willing rather to work than to beg. (Tirinus)'
      v:004:
        - "RUT:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>With you.</i> This blessing the Church still adopts in her service. (Worthington) --- It was customary to bless one another during harvest, Psalm cxxviii. 5, 8. (Calmet) --- Booz did, as Cato advises, <i>Ne opera parcas visere;</i> \"See what is going forward.\" The master's eye makes the servants diligent. (Haydock)."
      v:005:
        - 'RUT:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Man.</i> Hebrew <i>náhar,</i> a man in the prime of life. He had the care of all in the field, during the absence of his master; whence Josephus styles him <i>agrocomos,</i> or <i>agronomos.</i> (Menochius) --- Homer mentions an officer or king, standing with his sceptre in the midst of the reapers, and silently rejoicing at the rich profusion of the field. (Iliad) --- Thus we see the taste of the ancients, while agriculture was honourable.'
      v:007:
        - 'RUT:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Moment.</i> Hebrew, "her tarrying in the house is but small, <i>or</i> till now, that she remains a little in the house." She entered the house with the reapers, during the excessive heat of the day, and to avoid the suspicion of taking more than was allowed, during their absence. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "she hath not discontinued to work in the field even a little." Her diligence and modesty attracted the notice of Booz. (Haydock).'
      v:009:
        - 'RUT:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Thee.</i> The men tied the corn after the female reapers, (Calmet) and Ruth was authorized to follow, close at their heels, without fear. (Haydock) --- <i>The waters.</i> This is not expressed in Hebrew but it is in the Septuagint and the Chaldean. (Calmet) --- The privilege of having water in those countries was very considerable. (Menochius)'
      v:010:
        - 'RUT:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Country.</i> St. Elizabeth was impressed with similar sentiments, when she was visited by the blessed Virgin; (Haydock) and so was David, when he considered the wonderful condescension of God, Psalm viii. 5., cxliii. 3., and Job vii. 17. (Calmet) --- Frequent instances occur in Scripture of people worshipping, or shewing their gratitude to their fellow creatures, by this posture of the body. (Menochius) --- Yet no suspicion of idolatry attaches to them, Genesis xxiii. 7., &c. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'RUT:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Heretofore,</i> to embrace the same religion. (Menochius)'
      v:012:
        - 'RUT:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Work.</i> Booz doubted not but a full and eternal reward was due to good works. (Worthington) --- <i>Fled.</i> This similitude frequently occurs, (Psalm xxxv. 8., and Matthew xxiii. 37,) to denote protection. (Calmet). --- Chaldean, "Thou art come to be a proselyte, and to hide thyself under the shade of the majesty of his glory." (Menochius)'
      v:013:
        - 'RUT:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Heart.</i> This has the same meaning as the former part of the sentence. (Calmet) See Osee ii. 14. (Haydock) --- <i>Maids,</i> but more lowly and mean. (Menochius)'
      v:014:
        - 'RUT:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Vinegar,</i> or small wine, made on purpose for working people. Some think that such was presented to our Saviour. Yet vinegar was very frequently mixed with other things, and was esteemed particularly refreshing. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxiii. 1.) (Calmet) --- <i>Side.</i> Not in front, that they might not stare at her. (Menochius) --- <i>And she,</i> &c. Hebrew, "and he gave her frumenty, <i>or</i> parched corn." A little oil might be poured upon it. See Leviticus ii. 14., and 2 Kings xxvi. 28. (Haydock) --- Travellers in Ethiopia only take parched barley with them. (Calmet) --- <i>The leavings,</i> to Noemi. "Learn, says Seneca, (ep. 110,) to be content with a little." Septuagint, "and Booz heaped up food before her, and she ate and was filled, and left <i>a part.</i>" (Haydock) --- But it appears that she afterwards took it home, ver. 18. (Menochius) --- The vinegar and corn which were given to Ruth were very refreshing. The Spaniards still drink <i>posca,</i> or water and vinegar. (Tirinus)'
      v:015:
        - 'RUT:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Reap.</i> Hebrew, "if she will glean, even among the sheaves, do not cover her with confusion," (Haydock) or hinder her, Psalm xliii. 10. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'RUT:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Rod,</i> as Gedeon had done, Judges vi. 11. --- <i>That is,</i> &c., an explanation of the Vulgate. (Calmet)-The ephi contained three pecks and three pints. (Arbuthnot) --- Alcazar and Cornelius a Lapide say 960 ounces. (Menochius)'
      v:020:
        - 'RUT:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Dead.</i> He hath not forgotten Elimelech, his friend, for whose sake he treats his daughter-in-law with kindness. (Haydock) --- <i>Kinsman.</i> Hebrew adds, "one of our redeemers, (Calmet) <i>or</i> next kinsmen." (Haydock) --- To such the right of avenging the slain, of marrying the widow of the deceased, and entering upon his property, belonged. The best interpreters suppose that Booz was the nephew of Elimelech. (Calmet) (Leviticus xxv. 25., and Deuteronomy xxv. 5.) (Menochius)'
      v:023:
        - 'RUT:2:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>And the wheat.</i> Hebrew, Syriac and Arabic, "<i>It is good</i> that thou keep close to the maidens of Booz, and continue to glean with them till," &c. This was the advice of Noemi: but Providence ordered that Ruth should be married to Booz before the commencement of the wheat harvest. (Calmet) --- The Protestants agree with the Vulgate and Septuagint. "So she kept fast by, &c., unto the end of the barley harvest, and of the wheat harvest, and dwelt with her mother-in-law." These last words are expressed by the Vulgate in the following chapter. (Haydock).'

      v:001: 'RUT:2:1 | 1 | 1 | Now her husband Elimelech had a kinsman, a powerful man, and very rich, whose name was Booz.'
      v:002: 'RUT:2:2 | 2 | 2 | And Ruth, the Moabitess, said to her mother-in-law: If thou wilt, I will go into the field, and glean the ears of corn that escape the hands of the reapers, wheresoever I shall find grace with a householder, that will be favourable to me. And she answered her: Go, my daughter.'
      v:003: 'RUT:2:3 | 3 | 3 | She went, therefore, and gleaned the ears of corn after the reapers. And it happened that the owner of that field was Booz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.'
      v:004: 'RUT:2:4 | 4 | 4 | And behold, he came out of Bethlehem, and said to the reapers: The Lord be with you. And they answered him: The Lord bless thee.'
      v:005: 'RUT:2:5 | 5 | 5 | And Booz said to the young man that was set over the reapers: Whose maid is this?'
      v:006: 'RUT:2:6 | 6 | 6 | And he answered him: This is the Moabitess, who came with Noemi, from the land of Moab,'
      v:007: 'RUT:2:7 | 7 | 7 | And she desired leave to glean the ears of corn that remain, following the steps of the reapers: and she hath been in the field from morning till now, and hath not gone home for one moment.'
      v:008: 'RUT:2:8 | 8 | 8 | And Booz said to Ruth: Hear me, daughter, do not go to glean in any other field, and do not depart from this place: but keep with my maids,'
      v:009: 'RUT:2:9 | 9 | 9 | And follow where they reap. For I have charged my young men, not to molest thee: and if thou art thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of the waters whereof the servants drink.'
      v:010: 'RUT:2:10 | 10 | 10 | She fell on her face, and worshipping upon the ground, said to him: Whence cometh this to me, that I should find grace before thy eyes, and that thou shouldst vouchsafe to take notice of me, a woman of another country?'
      v:011: 'RUT:2:11 | 11 | 11 | And he answered her: All hath been told me, that thou hast done to thy mother-in-law after the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left thy parents, and the land wherein thou wast born, and art come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore.'
      v:012: 'RUT:2:12 | 12 | 12 | The Lord render unto thee for thy work, and mayst thou receive a full reward of the Lord the God of Israel, to whom thou art come, and under whose wings thou art fled.'
      v:013: 'RUT:2:13 | 13 | 13 | And she said: I have found grace in thy eyes, my lord, who hast comforted me, and hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, who am not like to one of thy maids.'
      v:014: 'RUT:2:14 | 14 | 14 | And Booz said to her: At meal-time come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. So she sat at the side of the reapers, and she heaped to herself frumenty, and ate and was filled, and took the leavings.'
      v:015: 'RUT:2:15 | 15 | 15 | And she arose from thence, to glean the ears of corn as before. And Booz commanded his servants, saying: If she would even reap with you, hinder her not:'
      v:016: 'RUT:2:16 | 16 | 16 | And let fall some of your handfuls of purpose, and leave them, that she may gather them without shame, and let no man rebuke her when she gathereth them.'
      v:017: 'RUT:2:17 | 17 | 17 | She gleaned therefore in the field till evening: and beating out with a rod, and threshing what she had gleaned, she found about the measure of an ephi of barley, that is, three bushels:'
      v:018: 'RUT:2:18 | 18 | 18 | Which she took up, and returned into the city, and shewed it to her mother-in-law: moreover, she brought out, and gave her of the remains of her meat, wherewith she had been filled.'
      v:019: "RUT:2:19 | 19 | 19 | And her mother-in-law said to her: Where hast thou gleaned to-day, and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that hath had pity on thee. And she told her with whom she had wrought: and she told the man's name, that he was called Booz."
      v:020: 'RUT:2:20 | 20 | 20 | And Noemi answered her: Blessed be he of the Lord: because the same kindness which he shewed to the living, he hath kept also to the dead. And again she said: The man is our kinsman.'
      v:021: 'RUT:2:21 | 21 | 21 | And Ruth said: He also charged me, that I should keep close to his reapers, till all the corn should be reaped.'
      v:022: "RUT:2:22 | 22 | 22 | And her mother-in-law said to her: It is better for thee, my daughter, to go out to reap with his maids, lest in another man's field some one may resist thee."
      v:023: 'RUT:2:23 | 23 | 23 | So she kept close to the maids of Booz: and continued to glean with them, till all the barley and the wheat were laid up in the barns.'
  c:003:
    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'RUT:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>I will.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint may be read with an interrogation in the same sense. "Shall I not seek rest?" (Haydock) --- By this expression she means a husband, chap. i. 9. Marriage fixes the unsettled condition of women. (Calmet) --- Noemi being apprised of the law, entertained hopes that she could engage Booz to marry Ruth. (Haydock) --- Thus her penury would cease, and she would perhaps have children, as she earnestly desired. (Menochius)'
      v:002:
        - 'RUT:3:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Night.</i> In Palestine, and other maritime countries, a breeze generally arises from the sea in the evening. It was then that Booz seized the opportunity of winnowing his barley; so that, at an early hour, he gave Ruth six measures, and retired to rest, beside some of the remaining sheaves (Calmet) in an adjoining apartment, erected for the protection of the reapers during the great heats, and to contain the corn in case of a shower. (Columella, i. 7. and ii. 51.) This shade was probably in the same field where Ruth had been gleaning. (Calmet) --- She might lawfully seize this opportunity (Haydock) to obtain an honest marriage. (Du Hamel)'
      v:003:
        - 'RUT:3:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Garments.</i> External cleanliness has many attractions, Judith x. 3. Many editions of the Hebrew are very confused, by the improper insertion of <i>i</i>: "I will put the garments on thee, and <i>get me down,</i>" &c. (Kennicott)'
      v:004:
        - "RUT:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Sleepeth.</i> People of fortune did not disdain to sleep among the corn.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<em>Non pudor in <i>stipulâ</i>placidam cepisse quietem,</em>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<em>Nec fœnum capiti supposuisse suo.-----</em> Ovid, Fast. i. (Menochius){JOIN}--- <i>Feet.</i> It is said that women in the East, enter their husbands' bed at the feet, to shew their submission. (Calmet) --- Ruth was conducted on this occasion by a superior Being, who gave success to her undertaking, and disposed the mind of Booz (Theodoret) to grant her just claim. It was according to the law of Moses, that a widow might demand in marriage the next kinsman of her deceased husband, if she had no children by him. Ruth considered Booz in this light. (Haydock) --- She was not actuated by a love of pleasure, as the latter was convinced, otherwise she would have desired to marry some young man, (Calmet) in her own country, ver. 10. Both parties would probably have their clothes on among the straw, so that there would be less danger; though, if their virtue had not been very constant, (Haydock) the situation was no doubt sufficiently perilous, and in other circumstances could not have been tolerated. (Calmet) --- We must also remember, that clandestine marriages were not then forbidden. (Salien) --- That same night they might have married, had not another's being nearer akin proved an obstacle; (Tirinus) so that Booz could not have claimed the inheritance of Elimelech, though he might have taken Ruth to wife. By deferring another day he obtained both. (Haydock) --- Lyranus thinks Ruth could be excused only by ignorance, in thus exposing herself to danger, and that Noemi was guilty of a grievous sin, in giving her such advice. But they both had the purest views, seeking only an honest marriage, by arts which were not blamable. See St. Thomas Aquinas, 2. 2. q. 154., and 169., and Cajetan. (Tirinus) --- Noemi was well assured of the virtue of both parties, and followed the directions of the Holy Spirit, (Calmet) as the event shewed. (Worthington) --- Dr. Watson justly reproves the censure of Paine, who calls Ruth, \"a strolling country girl, creeping slily to bed to her cousin,\" and exclaims, \"pretty stuff indeed to be called the word of God!\" But in correcting this impertinent remark, he seems to allow that some things have been inserted in the Scriptures by human authority, so as not to be the word of God. This concession is more dangerous than the censure of Paine, and the quotation from St. Augustine by no means countenances it, as it barely insinuates that an express <i>revelation</i> was not requisite to insert some things, which the authors might know by other means. The holy father never doubted but every part of Scripture was equally inspired, and to be received without the smallest hesitation. What Dr. Law, and other such \"good Christians,\" might think, does not regard us. (Haydock) --- \"As a person imploring protection, Ruth laid herself down at the foot of an aged kinsman's bed, and she rose up with as much innocence as she laid herself down. She was afterwards married to Booz, and reputed by all her neighbours as a virtuous woman; and they were more likely to know her character than you are. Whoever reads the Book of Ruth, bearing in mind the simplicity of ancient manners, will find it an interesting story of a poor young woman,\" &c. (Watson, let. 4.) --- <i>Must do.</i> She trusted to the superior wisdom of Booz, knowing perhaps that he was not absolutely the nearest relation, but being convinced, as the event proved, that the other would not consent to marry Ruth on the conditions specified by the law. (Salien, A. 2810.[in the year of the world 2810.])"

(De re Rust. c. 131.) Hence the <i>vacuna</i> of Ovid. (Fast. vi.) (Tirinus) --- The pagans did this in honour of Jupiter and Ceres. But the true God had enjoined his people (Haydock) to offer the first-fruits to him, and to feast in his presence, Leviticus xxiii. 10., and Deuteronomy xxvi. 21. --- <i>Sheaves,</i> either of corn or of straw.

(Haydock) --- Ruth modestly admonishes him of this duty, and begs that he would take her to wife, (Calmet) as he might then have done without any other formality. (Serar. q. vii.) --- We find a similar expression [in] Ezechiel xvi. 8., and Deuteronomy xxii. 80. Some think that she only asked for protection. The custom of the husband, stretching a part of his garment over his bride, was perhaps already established among the Hebrews. (Calmet) --- Hebrew and Septuagint, \"stretch thy wing over,\" &c. Chaldean, \"Let thy name be invoked upon thy handmaid, to take me to wife.\" (Menochius; Isaias iv. 1.)"

The Septuagint and Chaldean are conformable to the Vulgate and the opinion of the Jews is abandoned by most interpreters; (Calmet) and by the Protestants, \"well, let him do the kinsman's part.\" (Haydock) --- <i>Liveth</i>. Chaldean, \"Bound by an oath, before the Lord, I say that I will fulfil my promise unto thee.\""

Most people supply ephi. St. Jerome, who has translated six bushels, (allowing three to the ephi; chap. ii. 17,) has understood that Booz gave Ruth two ephi. If we explain it of six ephi, the burden would be great enough, consisting of 180 pints or pounds of barley. Bonfrere would supply six gomers, each of which consisted of only the tenth part of the ephi, or three pints, in all 18. But such a present seems too inconsiderable. We may therefore stick to St. Jerome, whose six measures (Calmet--- <i>modios,</i> bushels; Haydock.) make about 60 pints; (Calmet) or, according to others, 160 pounds, which, though heavy, a woman might carry. The Septuagint insinuate, that Ruth carried the barley in her apron. (Menochius) --- <i>And.</i> Hebrew, "he <i>went.</i>" But the text is probably corrupted. (Calmet)'

But what right had Noemi or Ruth to the land, since women could not inherit? The latter might indeed retain her title, as long as she continued unmarried. But Noemi only acted in her behalf. Selden thinks that their respective husbands had made them a present of some land. Josephus (ver. 11) asserts, that the person whom Booz addressed had already possession, and that he resigned his claim, as he would not take another wife.

It ought to be, conformably to some manuscripts and the ancient versions, "thou must also take Ruth," ver. 10. (Capel, p. 144, and 362.) (Kennicott) (Haydock) --- We see here the observance of two laws, the one preserving the inheritance in the same family, and the other obliging the next of kin to marry the widow of the deceased, if he would enjoy his land, Leviticus xxv. 10., and Deuteronomy xxv. 5. (Calmet) --- Such widows as designed to comply with this condition, took possession of the land on the death of their husband, and conveyed it to those whom they married, till their eldest son became entitled to it.

Chaldean, "Since I cannot make use of this privilege, having already a wife, and not being allowed to take another, as that might cause dissensions in my family, and spoil my inheritance, do thou redeem it,….as thou art unmarried."'

Booz was under another sort of necessity, and was bound to comply with the law; (Calmet) so that he was guilty of no sin, as Beza would pretend. (Tirinus) --- Some also remark, that the exclusion of the people of Moab from the Church of God, regarded not the females, (St. Augustine, q. 35, In Deut.; Serar.; Tirinus; &c.) particularly if they embraced the true religion. According to the Rabbins, Obed should have been accounted a Moabite, as they say children follow the condition of their mothers: but we need not here adopt their decisions. --- <i>People.</i> Hebrew, "and from the gate of his place."

      v:020:
        - "RUT:4:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Salmon.</i> Hebrew and Chaldean, Salma, (Haydock) though we read Salmon in the following verse. (Calmet) --- This is one argument adduced by Houbigant, to shew that this genealogy is now imperfect. He concludes that Salma ought to be admitted, as well as Salmon; and, as the reason for calling the first son of Ruth, Obed, \"serving <i>or</i> ploughing,\" seems rather harsh, as we should naturally expect some more glorious title. He thinks that the immediate son of Ruth was called Jachin, \"he shall establish;\" and that Solomon called one of the pillars before the temple by his name, as he did the other Booz, \"in strength,\" in honour of his ancestors. <i>Báz icin</i> means, \"In strength (or solidity) it (he) shall (stand <i>or</i>) establish.\" As the son of Booz established his father's house, (ver. 10, 11,) so these pillars denoted the stability of the temple. We must thus allow that the hand of time has mutilated the genealogy of David, and that two ought to be admitted among his ancestors, who have been here omitted, as St. Matthew likewise passes them over as well as three others, who were the descendants of Joram. The same omission of Jachin occurs 1 Paralipomenon ii. 11, where we find Salma instead of Salmon. Houbigant supposes that the sacred writers, Esdras and St. Matthew, gave the genealogies as they found them, without correcting the mistakes of transcribers. (Chronolog. sacra, p. 81.) But there might be some reason for the omission which we do not know; and Nahasson, Booz, and Joram might be said to beget Salmon, Obed, and Jechonias, though they were not their immediate children. Salien and many others assert, that there were three of the name of Booz, succeeding each other, so that six persons instead of four fill up the space of 440 years, from the taking of Jericho till the building of the temple. Salien, in the year of the world 2741, in which year he places the birth of the third Booz, who married Ruth, seventy years afterwards. Petau allows 520 years from the coming out of Egypt till the fourth year of Solomon, so that he leaves above 420 years to the three generations of Booz, Obed, and Isai. But he prudently passes over this chronological difficulty. Usher supposes that each of these people were almost 100 years old when they had children; and he produces many examples of people who lived beyond that age, but he does not mention any, since the days of Moses, who had children at such an advanced age, much less that many in the same family, and in succession, were remarkable for such a thing. Moreover, according to Houbigant's chronology, Booz and Obed must have had children when they were almost 120, and Isai in his 107th year. But by admitting Salma and Jachin, the five persons might each have sons when they were about seventy, and thus would complete 347 years. See chap. ii. 1. (Haydock)."

Ruth, notwithstanding her poverty, was a striking figure of the Christian Church. (Haydock) --- The Gentiles were <i>strangers</i> to Christ, on account of their errors, but related to him in as much as they were his creatures. Their miserable condition pleaded hard for them, that Jesus would receive them under his protection, espouse and give them rest and peace. Booz would not marry Ruth till the nearer relation had refused, and thus brought dishonour on himself; (Deuteronomy xxv.) so Jesus was principally sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and did not send his apostles to the Gentiles till the Jews had rejected their ministry. (Calmet) --- See St. Ambrose, de fide, iii. 5. (Du Hamel) --- Ruth was also a pattern of the most perfect virtues. See Louis de Puente. (Tirinus)'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - 'This Book is called <b>Ruth</b>, from the name of the person whose history is here recorded; who, being a Gentile, became a convert to the true faith, and marrying Booz, the great-grandfather of David, was one of those from whom Christ sprang according to the flesh, and an illustrious figure of the Gentile church. It is thought this book was written by the prophet Samuel. (Challoner) --- The Holy Ghost chose that the genealogy of David, and of the Messias, should be thus more clearly ascertained. (Theodoret) --- Christ proceeded from the Gentiles, as well as from the Jews, and his grace is given to both. (Worthington) --- <i>Send forth, 0 Lord, the lamb, the ruler of the earth, from Petra,</i> Isaias xvi. This was the capital city of Arabia Petrea, where Ruth is supposed to have lived, (Tostat) being, according to the Chaldean, &c., the daughter of Eglon, king of Moab. The Jews also pretend that Booz was the same person as Abesan, the judge. But it is by no means certain to what period this history belongs. Usher places it under Samgar, about 120 years after Josue. (Calmet) --- Salien believes that the famine, which obliged Elimelech to leave Bethlehem, happened under Abimelech, and that Noemi returned in the 7th year of Thola, A.C. 1243.[1243 B.C.] This event certainly took place under some of the judges; so that we may consider this book as an appendix to the preceding, like the last chapters, (Judges xvii.; &c.; Haydock) and a preface to the history of the kings. (Calmet)'
