      v:001:
        - "AMO:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Herdsmen.</i> St. Jerome's manuscripts after Aquila, have \"pastorals,\" (Haydock) <i>pastoralibus.</i> (Calmet) --- Theodotion retains <i>Nokedim.</i> Septuagint read <i>Accarim,</i> (Haydock) substituting <i>r</i> for <i>d,</i> (St. Jerome) and perhaps <em>á</em> for <i>n.</i> (Haydock) --- They have also \"Jerusalem,\" for <i>Israel,</i> though the prophecy regard the latter. The country south of <i>Thecua</i> has no towns, and is solely for pasture. (St. Jerome) --- Amos might have many flocks, like Mesa and king Dejotarus, 4 Kings iii. 4. (Calmet) --- David was taken from the flocks to be king, and Amos to be a prophet. (Worthington) --- <i>King.</i> These two lived long in prosperity. (Calmet) --- <i>Earthquake.</i> Many understand this of a great <i>earthquake,</i> which, they say, was felt at the time that king Ozias attempted to offer incense in the temple. But the best chronologists prove that the earthquake here spoken of must have been before that time: because Jeroboam the second, under whom Amos prophesied, was dead long before that attempt of Ozias. (Challoner) --- This is asserted by Usher. Yet his arguments are not conclusive. If the attempt and earthquake happened in the 23d year of Ozias, Amos might commence the year of the world 3215, six years before the death of Jeroboam, 4 Kings xv. 5., and Zacharias xi. 15. (Calmet) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] ix. 1.) fixes upon the former period. Jeroboam, however, died inthe 38th of Ozias, who was deposed 14 years later. (Worthington)"
      v:002:
        - "AMO:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Carmel.</i> \"God's vineyard,\" may denote any fruitful mountain. Amos refers to pastoral affairs. (Calmet)"
      v:003:
        - 'AMO:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Three---four.</i> That is, for their many unrepented of crimes. (Challoner) --- Three is the first number of which we can say "many or all." Four denotes excess. Thus God forgives many sins, yet punishes when they become excessive. (Worthington) --- Thus profane authors say, (Calmet){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Terque quaterque pectus percussa decorum.</i> (Virgil, Æneid iv.){JOIN}--- <i>Convert it.</i> That is, I will not spare them, nor turn away the punishments I design to inflict upon them. (Challoner) --- My decree is absolute. --- <i>Wains,</i> designed to make the corn come out, (Calmet) or to cut the straw. (St. Jerome) --- Such instruments were sometimes trailed over men. Septuagint, "they have sawed the pregnant women," &c. This circumstance is borrowed from 4 Kings viii. Damascus was often at war with Israel. But Jeroboam punished it as Theglathphalassar did afterwards, ver. 5., and 4 Kings xvi. 9. Amos might witness the ravages of the former. (Calmet) --- <i>Azael,</i> or Hazael, who slew his master, Benadad. (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - 'AMO:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Plain.</i> The city "Bikhath-Aven," or the latter word, probably denotes Baal, as the Syrians style Baal-Bek, the city which the Greeks call Heliopolis. The valley between the two mountains extending northward, is still called Bucca. --- <i>Pleasure.</i> Hebrew, "Beth Heden." We find Eden in a delightful part of Libanus. --- <i>Cyrene,</i> not in Africa, but on the river Cyrus, in Albania, 4 Kings xv. 29.'
      v:006:
        - 'AMO:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Edom.</i> The Philistines and Tyrians (ver. 9.) exercised this inhumanity on the Idomeans, probably before they had thrown off the yoke of Juda, under Joram, (4 Kings viii. 21.) as the Lord seems concerned for them; (Calmet) or they sold the captive Israelites to Edom, to increase their misery. (St. Jerome) --- Septuagint, "the captivity of Solomon," or the subjects of that monarch. But the Hebrew word means also <i>perfect,</i> (Haydock) or absolute, (Jeremias xiii. 19.; Calmet) or "pacific," seizing the citizens in times of peace. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - 'AMO:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Gaza.</i> Ozias, Ezechias, and Psammetichus, ravaged the country, 2 Paralipomenon xxvi. 6., 4 Kings xviii. 8., and Isaias xiv. 29. The Philistines recovered strength; but Nabuchodonosor, Alexander, and the Machabees conquered them again.'
      v:009:
        - 'AMO:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Brethren;</i> for Edom and the Jews sprung from the same stock. Some think that he alludes to the alliance between the king of Tyre and David. But that had long ceased, and was not agreeable to the law; (Exodus xxii. 32., and 3 Kings ix. 13.; Calmet) at least when it was attended with much danger. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - 'AMO:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Thereof.</i> Salmanasar besieged it five years (Menander) and Nabuchodonosor thirteen, when he destroyed Tyre, Ezechiel xxvi.'
      v:011:
        - 'AMO:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Sword.</i> Edom was subdued by David, and remained tributary till Joram. It attempted to recover its liberty under Josaphat, though the Hebrew text have improperly <i>Aram,</i> 2 Paralipomenon xx. 2, 23. The two nations were often at variance. (Calmet) --- <i>Cast off.</i> Septuagint, "violated the womb, <i>or</i> the mother on the earth."'
      v:012:
        - 'AMO:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Houses,</i> &c. Septuagint, "its foundations," (Haydock) or the fortified country. (St. Jerome) --- Bosor lay towards Philadelphia, in the ancient territory of Edom. Their strong places were seized by Ozias, by the Chaldeans, and by the Machabees.'
      v:013:
        - 'AMO:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Border.</i> They pretended that Galaad belonged to them, Judges xi. 12. David subdued Ammon; but after the division of the kingdom, they recovered their independence, and took occasion to commit these cruelties, while Israel had to contend with Syria. Jeremias (xlix. 1.) speaks of a later period.'
      v:014:
        - 'AMO:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Rabba,</i> the capital, called also Philadelphia. Ozias and Joatham attacked the people with advantage. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - 'AMO:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Melchom,</i> the god or idol of the Ammonites, otherwise called Moloch, and Melech; which, in Hebrew, signifies a <i>king,</i> or Melchom <i>their king.</i> (Challoner) --- He assumed the title of "their king," Judges xi. 14., and Jeremias xlix. 3. (Haydock) --- Blind people, who could not see the vanity of such impotent gods! (Calmet) --- <i>Both he.</i> Septuagint, "and their priests." (Haydock)'

    verses:
      v:001: 'AMO:1:1 | 1 | 1 | The {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}words of Amos, who was among herdsmen of Thecua: which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Ozias, king of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joas, king of Israel, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 1}two years {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 2}before the earthquake.'
      v:002: 'AMO:1:2 | 2 | 2 | And he said: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}The Lord will roar from Sion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem: and the beautiful places of the shepherds have mourned, and the top of Carmel is withered.'
      v:003: 'AMO:1:3 | 3 | 3 | Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Damascus, and for four, I will not convert it: because they have threshed Galaad with iron wains.'
      v:004: 'AMO:1:4 | 4 | 4 | And I will send a fire into the house of Azael, and it shall devour the houses of Benadad.'
      v:005: 'AMO:1:5 | 5 | 5 | And I will break the bar of Damascus: and I will cut off the inhabitants from the plain of the idol, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of pleasure: and the people of Syria shall be carried away to Cyrene, saith the Lord.'
      v:006: 'AMO:1:6 | 6 | 6 | Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Gaza, and for four, I will not convert it, because they have carried away a perfect captivity to shut them up in Edom.'
      v:007: 'AMO:1:7 | 7 | 7 | And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the houses thereof.'
      v:008: 'AMO:1:8 | 8 | 8 | And I will cut off the inhabitant from Azotus, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ascalon: and I will turn my hand against Accaron, and the rest of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord God.'
      v:009: 'AMO:1:9 | 9 | 9 | Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Tyre, and for four, I will not convert it: because they have shut up an entire captivity in Edom, and have not remembered the covenant of brethren.'
      v:010: 'AMO:1:10 | 10 | 10 | And I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the houses thereof.'
      v:011: 'AMO:1:11 | 11 | 11 | Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Edom, and for four, I will not convert him: because he hath pursued his brother with the sword, and hath cast off all pity, and hath carried on his fury, and hath kept his wrath to the end.'
      v:012: 'AMO:1:12 | 12 | 12 | I will send a fire into Theman: and it shall devour the houses of Bosra.'
      v:013: 'AMO:1:13 | 13 | 13 | Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not convert him: because he hath ript up the women with child, of Galaad, to enlarge his border.'
      v:014: 'AMO:1:14 | 14 | 14 | And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabba: and it shall devour the houses thereof with shouting in the day of battle, and with a whirlwind in the day of trouble.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'AMO:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Ashes.</i> Some think that he alludes to 4 Kings iii. 27., or rather to some war, the ashes of the dead were disturbed. (Calmet) --- Both these acts of inhumanity deserved severe punishment. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - 'AMO:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Fire:</i> war under Ozias. (Calmet) --- <i>Carioth.</i> Septuagint, "the cities." Carioth has this meaning, but is was also the name of a great city, Jeremias xlviii. 24. (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - 'AMO:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Judge,</i> ruler, or head, shall be no more.'
      v:004:
        - 'AMO:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Walked.</i> After Solomon, scarcely a good prince appeared, till the days of Amos. Juda imitated the idolatry of Israel, hoping thus to find assistance. (Calmet) --- His crime was the more grievous, as they had the law. (Worthington)'
      v:005:
        - 'AMO:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Fire.</i> Under Joathan, Rasin, &c., invaded the country. Achaz increased the misery, by applying to the Assyrians. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'AMO:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Just man.</i> Joseph, (Rupert) or our Saviour, (Sanctius) or any other. The expression is proverbial, Ezechiel xiii. 19. (Calmet) --- Israel contemned the law, and adopted the abominations of all. (Worthington)'
      v:007:
        - 'AMO:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Humble,</i> provoking him to anger. --- <i>Name.</i> Such incests caused infidels to blaspheme, Leviticus xviii. 8. (Calmet) --- They must be punished with severity. (Worthington)'
      v:008:
        - 'AMO:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Altar.</i> Herein they offended doubly, (Exodus xxii. 26.) as they used the garments of others to hide their shameful actions, 4 Kings xxiii. 7. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "and tying up their garments with cords, they made veils touching the altar, and drank wine <i>procured</i> by calumnies," (Haydock) or "rapine," &c. (Chaldean) --- <i>Condemned</i> by them unjustly, though some think that a very delicious and intoxicating wine is meant, such as was given to people in grief, Proverbs xxxi. 6., and Mark xv. 23. Helena learnt in Egypt how to compose such wine. (Homer, Odyssey iv.) --- Feasting in temples on carpets was an ancient custom.'
      v:009:
        - 'AMO:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Beneath.</i> The Israelites seemed like locusts in comparison, Numbers xiii. 34.'
      v:011:
        - 'AMO:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Nazarites.</i> Some went secretly to Jerusalem for this purpose; or perhaps they performed these rites illegally at Bethel: for many parts of the law were observed, though not perfectly, chap iv. 4. The Nazarites were in high estimation, Lamentations iv. 7. But the dissolute Israelites (Calmet) derided them as well as the prophets, (Haydock) and attempted to make them transgress. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - 'AMO:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>I will screek.</i> Unable to bear any longer the enormous load of your sins, &c. The Spirit of God, as St. Jerome takes notice, accommodates itself to the education of the prophet, and inspires him with encouragements taken from country affairs. (Challoner) --- Septuagint, "I am overturned." Hebrew, "pressed." (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'AMO:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Swift.</i> Jeroboam I. Other kings are described afterwards. (St. Jerome) --- In the latter times all was in confusion. (Calmet)'

      v:006: 'AMO:2:6 | 6 | 6 | Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Israel, and for four, I will not convert him: because he hath sold the just man for silver, and the poor man for a pair of shoes.'
      v:007: 'AMO:2:7 | 7 | 7 | They bruise the heads of the poor upon the dust of the earth, and turn aside the way of the humble: and the son and his father have gone to the <i>same</i> young woman, to profane my holy name.'
      v:008: 'AMO:2:8 | 8 | 8 | And they sat down upon garments laid to pledge by every altar: and drank the wine of the condemned in the house of their God.'

      v:010: 'AMO:2:10 | 10 | 10 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}It is I that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and I led you forty years through the wilderness, that you might possess the land of the Amorrhite.'
      v:011: 'AMO:2:11 | 11 | 11 | And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not so, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord?'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'AMO:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Family,</i> including all the posterity of Jacob. (Worthington) --- He afterwards addresses the ten tribes in particular. (St. Jerome) (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'AMO:3:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Known,</i> with love, (Haydock) and favoured with the law, &c. Above all, styling you my people, Exodus xix. 6., and Ezechiel xx. 5. (Calmet) --- <i>Visit.</i> That is, punish. (Challoner) --- I will treat you like my children, that I may spare you in eternity. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'AMO:3:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Agreed?</i> As they cannot do this well, so neither can man be acceptable to God, unless he keep his laws. (Worthington) --- The prophet here proves his mission, intimating that if he were not inspired, he would soon be open to detection. He had been banished from Bethel, chap. vii. By many similes, he shows that the event will prove the sincerity of his character, and that he cannot resist the holy spirit which is in him.'
      v:004:
        - 'AMO:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Nothing?</i> Thus, should I inveigh against your crimes, if there were no need?'
      v:005:
        - 'AMO:3:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Somewhat?</i> When the prophet speaks, has he no reason? God shews that he has sent him, by inflicting the punishments which he denounces.'
      v:006:
        - 'AMO:3:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Afraid.</i> Yet you can hear these terrible truths without consternation! Will you therefore escape? (Calmet) --- <i>Evil.</i> He speaks of the <i>evil</i> of punishments of war, famine, pestilence, desolution, &c., but not of the <i>evil</i> of sin, of which God is not the author. (Challoner) --- All evil of punishment is sent by God, either to reclaim sinners or to be the beginning of sorrows, if they die impenitent. (Worthington) --- You know that He rewards or punishes. If, therefore, what I foretell come to pass, do not blame me.'
      v:007:
        - 'AMO:3:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Prophets.</i> In vain then would you silence them, chap. ii. 12, and vii. 12. He always tends to the conclusion, ver. 8. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - 'AMO:3:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Azotus.</i> Septuagint, "Assyrians." --- <i>Follies.</i> Septuagint, "wonders." Let your greatest enemies know what crimes you commit against yourselves (Haydock) and others.'
      v:011:
        - "AMO:3:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>About,</i> As oxen tread out corn, going round a tree. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"Tyre even all around, thy land shall be a desert.\" <i>Tsar</i> means \"Tyre and tribulation,\" according to St. Jerome's master. (Haydock)"
      v:012:
        - 'AMO:3:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Ear:</i> things of small value. Thus few even of the poor will escape the Assyrians. (Menochius) --- <i>Damascus.</i> Some render "couch side." But there is no proof of this being accurate. Jeroboam II subdued Damascus, and reigned in prosperity. Who would then have thought that Israel should so soon be removed into Media? (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "over-against the tribe <i>of Juda,</i> and in Damascus, priests hear," &c. They probably left <i>hares,</i> (Haydock) "couches," (Aquila) untranslated, and some person has substituted "priests." (St. Jerome) --- Only the miserable (Menochius) or fugitives escape the enemy. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - 'AMO:3:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Bethel.</i> Manahem seems to have sent one of the calves to engage Phul to come to his assistance, Osee x. 5., and 4 Kings xv. 19. Salmanasar had both, Osee viii. 5. Josias afterwards defiled the profane altars, 4 Kings xxiii. 15. --- <i>Horns,</i> made of brass, which the Assyrians carried off. (Calmet) --- The fairest possessions of sinners will at last perish. (Worthington)'
      v:015:
        - "AMO:3:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Winter.</i> Septuagint, \"winged house,\" to keep off cold, (St. Jerome) or to give air. (Calmet) --- <i>Summer-house.</i> The noblemen had such is cooler regions. (Menochius) --- The kings of Persia passed the summer at Ecbatana. (Xenophon, Cyrop. viii.) --- Palladius (i. 12.) orders that the summer apartments must look to the north. --- <i>Ivory.</i> Many ornaments of this nature appeared in them, (Calmet) whence Achab's palace was so called, 3 Kings xxii. 39. (Haydock)"

        - 'AMO:4:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Fat kine.</i> He means the great ones that lived in plenty and wealth, (Challoner) and without restraint, (Isaias xv. 5., and Jeremias xlvi. 20.; Calmet) having no compassion for the poor. (Worthington) --- The women who had too great an ascendency over their husbands, like Jezabel, may also be meant. (Theodoret; Grotius) --- In many parts of the East the women affect being fat.'
      v:002:
        - 'AMO:4:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Holiness.</i> He has none but himself to swear by, Hebrews vi. 13. His word is infallible; but he condescends to use an oath to make a deeper impression on man. --- <i>Pikes;</i> spits, or large shields. Hebrew also, "They will lead you away with hooks, (in the nose, Isaias xxxvii. 29.) and your children with fish-hooks," or pots. You shall be treated like victims, being either roasted or boiled. No part shall be left.'
      v:003:
        - 'AMO:4:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Breaches</i> of the city. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "naked." Hebrew, "apart." (Haydock) --- The victors shall divide you among them. (Calmet) --- <i>Armon,</i> a foreign country; some understand it of Armenia, (Challoner) and this is the general opinion. (Menochius) --- Septuagint, "on Mount Remmon." Theodotion, "Mona." Israel was removed into <i>Armenia,</i> "the mountain of Menni," Jeremias li. 27.'
      v:004:
        - 'AMO:4:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Galgal.</i> Thither the people went of their own accord, as to a place of devotion, Osee iv. 15. Amos ironically tells them to proceed, as Christ addressed the Jews, Matthew xxiii. 32. (Calmet) --- After many admonitions have proved fruitless, God suffers infidels to act as they please. (Worthington) --- This is the most dreadful of his judgments. (Haydock) --- <i>Morning,</i> with haste. --- <i>Three days.</i> This also may denote the false exactitude of the Israelites to perform what God did not require, while they neglected the most essential duties, like the Pharisees. It may also imply the giving tithes every third year, (Deuteronomy xiv. 28.) or presenting themselves at the three great festivals, Exodus xxiii. 14. The schismatics observed parts of the law, and had a devotion of their own <i>choice.</i> (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'AMO:4:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>With.</i> Hebrew <i>mechamets,</i> (Haydock) also "without leaven." It was expressly forbidden, (Leviticus ii. 11.) though not in the first fruits, Leviticus xxiii. 17. --- <i>It,</i> to beg that God would remember you, Numbers x. 10. Hence the Pharisees did so when they gave alms, (Matthew vi. 2.; Calmet) but out of ostentation. (Haydock) --- Septuagint, "And they read the law <i>of their own invention,</i> (Theodoret) or <i>of God,</i> out of <i>the land,</i> (which the Jews were not to do; St. Chrysostom, or. 3. c. Jud. Const. Apost. vi. 24.) and proclaimed praise <i>or</i> confession." (Haydock) --- These interpreters read inaccurately, (Calmet) <i>krau méuts thure,</i> &c., yet S. Jerome explains their words of heretics reading the Scriptures out of the true Church, and misapplying them.'
      v:006:
        - 'AMO:4:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Dulness,</i> (<i>stuporem</i>) as when the teeth have bitten at a stone (Haydock) and are edged, Jeremias xxxi. 29. Septuagint, "gnashing." Hebrew, "cleanness," through want of food. Eliseus foretold a famine under Achab, 4 Kings viii. 1. That of Joel (i.) seems to have happened later than this. (Calmet) --- God sent these afflictions for their amendment. (Worthington)'
      v:007:
        - 'AMO:4:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Months.</i> The latter rain falls in April. See Deuteronomy xi. 14. (Calmet) --- <i>Harvest.</i> Septuagint have as usual, "vintage." But this is less accurate, as it never rains in the preceding summer months. (St. Jerome)'
      v:009:
        - 'AMO:4:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Wind.</i> Protestants, "blasting." (Haydock) --- "Pestilential air," (Septuagint, Symmachus, &c.) which destroys the corn (Calmet) and men. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - 'AMO:4:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Egypt,</i> as I published the Egyptians, (Calmet) or the Hebrews, when they came thence, and wished to return. (Chaldean; St. Cyril) --- <i>Horses.</i> I have deprived you of them, (Haydock) under Achab and Joachaz, 4 Kings vi. and xiii. --- <i>Nostrils.</i> Hazael slew many subjects of Jehu, 4 Kings x. 32. (Calmet) --- The stench of their carcasses and of the locusts caused <i>death</i> or the plague. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'AMO:4:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Burning.</i> This comparison shews the condition of Israel. Hardly any escaped, Zacharias iii. 2., and 1 Corinthians iii. 15. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'AMO:4:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>These.</i> He mentions not what, to keep them in greater suspense and dread; (St. Jerome) or he will put in execution what he had threatened before, ver. 2. --- <i>Meet.</i> Septuagint, "beseech." Aquila, "oppose," or to receive the Messias. (St. Jerome) --- Prepare by repentance to find mercy. (Calmet) --- After long captivity, Christ will save some. (Worthington)'
      v:013:
        - 'AMO:4:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Wind.</i> Septuagint, "the Spirit, and announcing to man his Christ," (Haydock) or Cyrus. (Theodotion) --- But this version has read improperly. (Calmet) --- Some hence brought an argument against the divinity of the Holy Spirit. (St. Jerome) --- <i>Mist.</i> Septuagint, "the morning and the cloud," spreading light or darkness over man. --- <i>Earth, on the wings of the wind,</i> Psalm xvii. 11. (Calmet)'

St. Jerome's master asserts that the latter means \"efflugence.\" <i>Cima</i> is rendered the Pleiades by Aquila and Theodotion; \"the seven stars,\" by Protestants. (Haydock) --- When such allusions to the heathen mythology occur, they give no sanction to it, but serve to explain what is meant.

        - 'AMO:5:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Did you offer,</i> &c. Except the sacrifices that were offered at the first, in the dedication of the tabernacle, the Israelites offered no sacrifices in the desert. (Challoner) --- They ceased after the beginning of the second year. (St. Augustine, q. 47 in Exodus, Leviticus vii., &c.) (Worthington) --- God did not require sacrifices when the people came out of Egypt, Jeremias vii. 22., and Deuteronomy xii. 8. They were not performed so regularly in the desert, (Calmet) and the people still bore a secret affection for idols, (ver. 26.) which rendered all their victims useless. (Haydock)'
      v:026:
        - 'AMO:5:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>A tabernacle,</i> &c. All this alludes to the idolatry which they committed, when they were drawn away by the daughters of Moab to the worship of their gods, Numbers xxv. (Challoner) --- They imitated the superstitions of Egypt, and bore the image of Osiris, adorned with a star and crescent, on a sort of base, under a canopy. Hebrew, "You carried the tents of your king and the base of your statues, the star of your gods, which you have made for yourselves." Septuagint by changing (Calmet) <i>ciun</i> into <i>Rephan,</i> or {GREEK:START raiphan}ραιφαν{GREEK:END}, (Haydock) have caused great confusion among commentators. If any change were requisite, (Calmet) <i>cima</i> (Haydock) would be preferable, ver. 8., and Job ix. 9. Yet the Hebrew seems to be correct, and <i>chiun</i> denotes a pedestal rather than an idol. Some read <i>Kevan,</i> the Saturn of the Arabs, &c., and think that <i>Rephan</i> has been mistaken for it. The only difficulty is the authority of St. Stephen, who follows the Septuagint, Acts vii. 43. Yet he probably spoke in Syriac, and might pronounce <i>Chevan;</i> though St. Luke might adopt the Septuagint in a matter of so little consequence. (Calmet, Diss.) --- This decision may not probably give satisfaction to those who reflect that both these authors were under the immediate influence of the Holy Ghost, and that if an error had crept into the copy of the Septuagint, he would have corrected it. Truth is always of sufficient consequence. See Kennicott, Diss. ii. p. 344. (Haydock) --- <i>Chiun</i> and <i>Rephan</i> are "expressive of the same" god or idol, representing the <i>machine</i> of the heavens. The people of Peru worshipped Choun. (Parkhurst, p. 137.) --- <i>Remvan</i> may be Remmon, (4 Kings v. 18.) or Saturn. (Grotius) --- In a Coptic alphabet of the planets it is thus explained: (De Dieu. Collier. Dict. Sept. and Acts) "You have taken the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your Rempham, figures," &c. Protestants marginal note, "the <i>Siccuth,</i> your king, and <i>Chiun,</i> your images, the star," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:027:
        - 'AMO:5:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Damascus,</i> or <i>Babylon,</i> (Acts vii.) into Mesopotamia, &c. The sense is the same. (Calmet) --- When the apostles quote passages, "they do not consider the words but the sense." (St. Jerome) --- One Greek copy, however, has <i>Damascus</i> in the Acts. (Haydock)'

Phul probably took Chalane, and Jeroboam II the other cities, ver. 15., and 4 Kings xiv. 25.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "AMO:7:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>The locust,</i> &c. These judgments by locusts and fire, which by the prophet's intercession were moderated, signify the former invasions of the Assyrians under Phul and Theglathphalassar, before the utter desolation of Israel by Salmanasar. (Challoner) --- Locusts denoted the Assyrian invaders, 4 Kings xviii. (Worthington) --- <i>Formed.</i> Literally, \"the maker of the locust, in the beginning of the <i>herbs</i> shooting,\" &c., (Haydock) in spring. (St. Jerome) --- They pasture in our January: yet the grass of autumn may be meant. The king took the best which grows in summer. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"and lo, a swarm of locusts coming in the morning; and lo, one bruchus, Gog, the king,\" (Haydock) or \"against king Gog.\" (Calmet) --- Aquila has, \"of the king of Gaza.\" He probably left the original term, (St. Jerome) <i>gizze.</i> (Haydock) --- The invasion of the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Scythians is insinuated. (Theodoret) --- The latter came the year after the earthquake, chap. i. (Pezron.) --- This was the first vision of Amos. (Calmet) --- He saw the first and last inroads of the Assyrians, as well as the prosperity of Jeroboam. (Menochius)"
      v:002:
        - 'AMO:7:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>When.</i> Septuagint, "If it shall eat up," &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Little.</i> After Jeroboam II, the kingdom fell to decay, when Manahem called in the Assyrians. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'AMO:7:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>The.</i> Septuagint, "Repent, O Lord, on this head, and this shall," &c. --- <i>Not be:</i> the grass shall not be totally devoured. (Haydock) --- The king of the Assyrians invaded Juda in vain, 4 Kings xix. (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - 'AMO:7:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Part</i> of the land, if the prophet had not interposed; (ver. 6.; Calmet) or rather civil wars desolated a great part of the kingdom, before the Lord was appeased. (Haydock) --- The fire foreshewed the captivity of the two tribes, 4 Kings xxiv. (Worthington)'
      v:006:
        - "AMO:7:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>The.</i> Septuagint, as ver. 3. (Haydock) --- We read not of locusts being sent, ver. 1. But fire of war certainly raged before the final catastrophe of Jehu's family, when Sellum slew Zacharias, 4 Kings xv. 8. (Calmet)"
      v:007:
        - 'AMO:7:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Plastered.</i> Hebrew, "wall, made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand." (Protestants) (Haydock) --- But Septuagint, Syriac, &c., seem more literal, (Calmet) "on a wall of adamant, and a diamond in his hand." Hebrew <i>anac,</i> (Haydock) whence a diamond was called <i>anactites,</i> (Orpheus) or <i>anachites.</i> (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxvii. 4.) --- Saturn had a scythe of adamant, and walls of this kind were deemed impervious even to the inhabitants of heaven. Thus Virgil describes the gates of hell:{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Porta adversa ingens solidoque adamante columnæ,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Vis ut nulla virum non ipsi exscindere ferro</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Cœlicolæ valeant.</i> ----- (Æneid vi.){JOIN}--- God appearing on such a wall, intimated that the separation between him and his people was complete. (Calmet) --- <i>Hic murus aheneus esto.</i> (Horace, i. ep. 1.)'
      v:008:
        - 'AMO:7:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Plaster.</i> Septuagint, "I will no more pass over it," the adamantine wall. I will hide their faults no longer. (Haydock) --- This third vision alluded to the distress of the ten tribes, 4 Kings xv. 20. (Worthington)'
      v:009:
        - 'AMO:7:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Idol.</i> Hebrew, "Isaac." (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "laughter." (Haydock) --- Isaac had resided for some time at Bersabee, which was a place frequented by idolaters, chap. v. 5., and viii. 14. Josias overthrew (4 Kings xxiii. 8.; Calmet) the profane "altars." (Haydock) --- <i>Sword.</i> His son Zacharias was slain after six months reign, ver. 6, 11.'
      v:010:
        - AMO:7:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Words.</i> Nothing could be more unfounded. Amos had indeed denounced many judgments; but he was not wanting in respect to the king. (Calmet)
      v:011:
        - 'AMO:7:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Sword.</i> The prophet did not say this, but that the Lord would <i>rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword;</i> which was verified when Zacharias, the son and successor of Jeroboam, was slain by the sword, 4 Kings xv. 10. (Challoner) --- The false prophet was therefore guilty of a lie. They accuse the preachers of truth as traitors. (Worthington) --- Thus many missionary priests have been traduced in England. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - "AMO:7:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Seer.</i> This was the ancient title of prophets; (1 Kings ix. 9.; Calmet) but it is here used contumeliously. (Haydock) --- We know not whether Amasias acted by the king's order or not. He was less afraid of the predictions than of losing his employment. (Calmet)"
      v:013:
        - "AMO:7:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Sanctuary,</i> or \"palace.\" (Kimchi) --- The kings resided commonly in Samaria; but they came hither to practise their religion, and had a palace. (Calmet) --- The <i>king's choice</i> was all that Amasias regarded, as many seem still to do, without examining whether the religion be true or false! Will the king screen them from the indignation of the just Judge at the hour of death? (Haydock)"
      v:014:
        - "AMO:7:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>I am not a prophet.</i> That is, I am not a prophet by education: nor is prophesying my calling or profession: but I am a herdsman, whom God was pleased to send hither to prophesy to Israel. (Challoner) --- He speaks with the like humility as [John] the baptist, John i. 21., and Luke vii. 26. It seems the prophets usually left their trade, and applied to meditation, Zacharias viii. 5. Septuagint, \"I was not a prophet, nor,\" &c. --- <i>Plucking.</i> Septuagint (Theodotion), \"pricking.\" (Calmet) --- This was requisite to make the fruit ripen in four days' time. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xiii. 7., and xvi. 27. --- Wild fig-trees have three sorts of fruits. The flies which proceed from some of them, prick the sweet figs, and make them ripen. (Tournefort i. let. 8.) --- Amos probably conveyed such wild figs to be near those of the garden, while at other times he fed his cattle."
      v:016:
        - 'AMO:7:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Drop;</i> menaces, Ezechiel xx. 46. Septuagint, "thou shalt not disturb (Calmet) <i>or</i> threaten the house of Jacob." (St. Jerome) --- <i>Idol;</i> the calf, worshipped in Bethel. (Challoner) --- Hebrew, "Isaac," as [in] ver. 9. (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - 'AMO:7:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Play.</i> Symmachus has better, "shall be treated as a harlot." A "husband would rather hear that his wife had been slain than defiled." (St. Jerome) --- <i>Line,</i> and divided among strangers. --- <i>Land,</i> out of Palestine. All other countries were deemed unclean. Amasias was probably exiled, or led captive by Theglathphalassar, as Salmanasar did not come till sixty-two years after the death of Jeroboam. We know no more of the history of Amasias. The martyrologies say he slew Amos. (Calmet) --- His name means "rigid," and he was a true image of a heretic. "All that he possesses shall fall to the share of devils." (St. Jerome)'

    verses:
      v:001: 'AMO:8:1 | 1 | 1 | These things the Lord shewed to me: and behold a hook to draw down the fruit.'
      v:002: 'AMO:8:2 | 2 | 2 | And he said: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A hook to draw down fruit. And the Lord said to me: The end is come upon my people, Israel: I will not again pass by them any more.'
      v:003: 'AMO:8:3 | 3 | 3 | And the hinges of the temple shall screek in that day, saith the Lord God: many shall die: silence shall be cast in every place.'
      v:004: 'AMO:8:4 | 4 | 4 | Hear this, you that crush the poor, and make the needy of the land to fail,'
      v:005: 'AMO:8:5 | 5 | 5 | Saying: When will the month be over, and we shall sell our wares: and the sabbath, and we shall open the corn: that we may lessen the measure, and increase the sicle, and may convey in deceitful balances.'
      v:006: 'AMO:8:6 | 6 | 6 | That we may possess the needy for money, and the poor for a pair of shoes, and may sell the refuse of the corn.'
      v:007: 'AMO:8:7 | 7 | 7 | The Lord hath sworn against the pride of Jacob: Surely I will never forget all their works.'
      v:008: 'AMO:8:8 | 8 | 8 | Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein: and rise up altogether as a river, and be cast out, and run down as the river of Egypt?'
      v:009: 'AMO:8:9 | 9 | 9 | And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord God, that the sun shall go down at mid-day, and I will make the earth dark in the day of light:'
      v:010: 'AMO:8:10 | 10 | 10 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation: and I will bring up sackcloth upon every back of yours, and baldness upon every head: and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the latter end thereof as a bitter day.'
      v:011: 'AMO:8:11 | 11 | 11 | Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send forth a famine into the land: not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.'
      v:012: 'AMO:8:12 | 12 | 12 | And they shall move from sea to sea, and from the north to the east: they shall go about seeking the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.'
      v:013: 'AMO:8:13 | 13 | 13 | In that day the fair virgins, and the young men shall faint for thirst.'
      v:014: 'AMO:8:14 | 14 | 14 | They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say: Thy God, O Dan, liveth: and the way of Bersabee liveth: and they shall fall, and shall rise no more.'

      v:001:
        - 'AMO:9:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Altar,</i> in Jerusalem, chap. viii. 3., and i. 2. God is going to punish Israel, (Calmet) or the two tribes. (Chaldean) (St. Jerome) --- The ruin of the altar and temple, imply the abolishing of sacrifices during the captivity, at Babylon. (Worthington) --- But Amos speaks rather of Israel. (Calmet) --- <i>Sword.</i> The princes and people are all guilty. Septuagint, "strike or cut on the heads of all." (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - 'AMO:9:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Hell;</i> to the deepest caves, where they used to flee, Psalm cxxxviii. 8.'
      v:003:
        - 'AMO:9:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Top,</i> in woods, or caverns. --- <i>Serpent.</i> Fishes and sea monsters are so called.'
      v:005:
        - "AMO:9:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>A river.</i> Septuagint, \"the river of Egypt,\" chap. viii. 8., and v. 24. (Calmet) --- Grabe's edition has \"its consummation (<i>or</i> utter ruin) shall rise up as a river.\" (Haydock)"
      v:006:
        - 'AMO:9:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Ascension,</i> or his high throne. (Challoner) --- Septuagint, "the ascent, and hath founded the declaration (Haydock) <i>or</i> promise upon," &c., which must be explained in a moral sense. (Calmet) --- <i>Bundle.</i> That is, his Church, bound up together by the bands of one faith and communion, (Challoner) which God will protect, and punish sinners. (Worthington) --- Hebrew, "his apartments in heaven, and his assembly (<i>or</i> footstool) on earth." --- <i>Sea,</i> by floods, or rather by rain, chap. v. 8. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'AMO:9:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Ethiopians.</i> That is, as black as they, by your iniquities. (Challoner) Chus was father of the Scythians, Arabs, &c. Yet none of these nations were under the peculiar protection of God. The Israelites depended too much on this prerogative, (Calmet) which they deserved to lose by their sins. (Haydock) --- God brought them out of Egypt. But he also took the Philistines from Caphtor, (Calmet) and enabled them to settle in the country. (Haydock) --- <i>Cappadocia.</i> Cyprus, (Genesis x. 14.) or rather Crete, 1 Kings. (Calmet) --- <i>Cyrene,</i> (Symmachus) "wall," (Theodotion) or "pit." (Septuagint) Theglathphalassar took Aram or the people of Damascus into captivity. (Calmet) --- Their future return is represented as already past. (Vatable; Mercer.)'
      v:009:
        - 'AMO:9:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Ground,</i> to be mixed with the good corn. --- Israel shall be purified in captivity. (Calmet) --- Though many perished, God still preserved his Church. (Worthington)'
      v:010:
        - 'AMO:9:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Us.</i> Such infidels delayed repentance, (Haydock) or laughed at the menaces of impending ruin, chap. v. 18. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'AMO:9:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>David.</i> St. James, after St. Peter, explains this of the vocation of the Gentiles, Acts xv. 15. (Worthington) --- After the fall of Israel, Juda still flourished: but this cannot be meant. The prosperity after the return from Babylon, or rather under Jesus Christ, must fulfil the prediction. Zorobalel had a very precarious authority, and the Machabees were not of the tribe of Juda, nor was their kingdom so flourishing or durable. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'AMO:9:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Edom,</i> subdued by Hircan, with the surrounding nations. The same letters may be read <i>Adam,</i> "man," as the Septuagint have, agreeably to Acts xv. 17. (Calmet) --- "That the rest of men might seek the Lord, (Grabe substitutes me) and all the nations upon whom my," &c. Edom and all mankind shall receive the glad tidings of salvation. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - 'AMO:9:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Shall overtake,</i> &c. By this is meant the great abundance of spiritual blessings; which, as it were, by a constant succession, shall enrich the Church of Christ. (Challoner) --- Munster, and his imitator, Clarius, see nothing but an allegory in this abundance and <i>return,</i> ver. 14. Yet the literal sense ought to be adopted, when it involves no contradiction. (Houbigant, pref. p. 297.) --- God promised a succession of crops to the faithful Israelites, (Leviticus xxvi. 5.) and the return of the ten tribes is frequently specified. (Calmet)'

intro:
  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "<b>Amos</b> prophesied in Israel about the same time as Osee, and was called from following the cattle to denounce God's judgments to the people of Israel and the neighbouring nations, for their repeated crimes, in which they continued with repentance. (Challoner) --- The kingdom was then almost free from idolatry, except that of the calves, yet dissolute and flourishing under Jeroboam II. The prophet spoke at Bethel, (chap. vii.) till the idolatrous priest, Amasias, forced him to flee to Thecua, four leagues south of Jerusalem, where he continued to prophesy against the various nations of Damascus, Juda, &c., but particularly against Israel, chap. i., &c. How long he continued is uncertain. St. Jerome and others account his style rustic; but St. Augustine (Doct. iv. 7.) as good a judge, pronounces that it was eloquent, and like that of the other inspired writers, suited to the speakers. (Calmet) --- Amos means \"one carrying,\" or \"a people torn away.\" (St. Jerome in Joel.) (Haydock) --- He deals in metaphors agreeably to his pastoral education, but is profound in sense. (St. Jerome, ep. ad Paulin.) --- After denouncing judgments on different nations, he foretells the coming of Christ and abundance of grace. (Worthington)"
