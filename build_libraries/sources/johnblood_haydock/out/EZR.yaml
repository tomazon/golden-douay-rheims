        - 'EZR:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>In.</i> Hebrew, "And (Calmet) or <i>But in,</i>" as [in] 2 Paralipomenon xxxvi. 22. (Haydock) --- Thus the historical works are connected. Spinosa infers, from this book being inserted after Daniel in the Hebrew Bible, that the same author wrote both. But the order of the books in the Septuagint and Vulgate is far more natural, (Calmet) and this has often varied in Hebrew, &c. (Kennicott) See 2 Paralipomenon xxxvi. 23. (Haydock) --- <i>First.</i> The design was only put in execution the following year. (The year of the world 3468.) --- <i>Cyrus</i> (Hebrew <i>coresh,</i> (Haydock) or Koresch) means "the sun," according to Ctesias and Plutarch. Josephus ([Antiquities?] xi. 1.) informs us that this prince became a friend of the Jews, in consequence of having seen the prediction of Isaias (xliv. 28., and xlv. 1.) fulfilled in his own person. He took Babylon, the year of the world 3466, and established the Persian empire, which was subverted by Alexander. (Calmet) --- He had before ruled over Persia 27 years, and only reigned three as sole monarch at Babylon. (Tirinus) --- <i>The Lord;</i> every good notion, even in infidels, proceeds from him. (Du Hamel) --- Cyrus was one of the best and greatest conquerors of antiquity. He was the son of Cambyses, by Mandane, princess of Media. Xenophon informs us that he died in his bed; (Haydock) and had been lately conquered. (Tirinus)'
      v:002:
        - 'EZR:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Earth,</i> which had belonged to the king of Babylon. (Haydock) --- This may be an hyperbole, or allusion to Isaias xlv. 1. (Menochius) --- The dominions of Cyrus were very extensive, (Xenophon, Cyrop. i. and viii.) reaching from Ethiopia to the Euxine sea, &c. He acknowledges that he received all from the hand of God. Nabuchodonosor makes a similar confession of his supreme dominion; (Daniel ii. 47.) and the potentates of Egypt and of Rome, procured sacrifices to be offered to him. But what advantage did they derive from this sterile knowledge of his divinity? since they did not honour him accordingly, but wished to join his worship with that of idols; though the force of miracles and of reason must have convinced them that there is but one God. (Calmet) --- <i>House,</i> or temple, Isaias xliv. 28. --- <i>Judea.</i> So the Septuagint read, but the Hebrew has "Juda," all along. The whole country now began to be known by the former name. (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - 'EZR:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>He is the God,</i> is placed within a parenthesis, by the Protestants. But the pagans might suppose that God was attached to this city, like their idols; and the temple was not yet begun. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - "EZR:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Rest,</i> who do not please to return. The Jews went at different times, and under the different leaders, Zorobabel, Esdras, and Nehemias. Many did not return at all. Cyrus allowed them full liberty. He permits money to be exported, particularly the half sicle, required [in] Exodus xxx. 13, and all voluntary contributions for the temple. (Grotius) (Calmet) --- He also enjoins the prefects of the provinces, (ver. 6., and chap. iii. 7.) whom Josephus styles \"the king's friends,\" to forward the work; and he even designed to perfect it at his own expence, chap. vi. 4."
      v:008:
        - 'EZR:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Gazabar</i> means, "the treasurer." (Hebrew; Syriac; Calmet; Protestants; 3 Esdras ii. 10.) (Haydock) --- <i>Son</i> is not in Hebrew, &c., (Menochius) and must be omitted. (Tirinus) --- <i>Sassabasar.</i> This was another name for Zorobabel, (Challoner) given by the Chaldeans, as they changed the name of Daniel into Baltassar. (Eusebius, Pr√¶p. Evan. xi. 3.) (Tirinus) --- But others think that this was the Persian "governor (Junius) of Judea," (3 Esdras) as one resided at Jerusalem, till the days of Nehemias, 2 Esdras v. 14. It does not appear that Zorobabel was invested with this dignity, before the reign of Darius Hystaspes, Aggeus ii. 24. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - 'EZR:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Knives.</i> Septuagint, &c., "changes" of garments. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - 'EZR:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Sort.</i> Septuagint and Syriac, "double;" yet of less value. (Calmet) --- As no first sort had been mentioned, and some Latin manuscripts read 2410, agreeably to 3 Esdras ii. 12., and the truth, (Hallet) it may be inferred that "thousands were expressed anciently by single letters, with a dot....over them." Afterwards, when numbers were expressed by words at length, the <i>b</i> being thus reduced to signify "two," was, of course, written <i>shnim;</i> but this word making nonsense with the following, has been changed into <i>mishnim,</i> a word not very agreeable to the sense here, and which leaves the sum total, now specified in the Hebrew text, very deficient for want of the 2000, thus omitted. (Kennicott, Dis. ii.) --- Josephus has, "30 golden cups, 2400 of silver." (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'EZR:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Hundred.</i> Only 2499 are specified. 3 Esdras reads, 5469. Josephus ([Antiquities?] xi. 1.) differs from all, reading 5210; which shews that the copies have varied, and that the Hebrew is incorrect. (Calmet) --- The use of numeral letters might cause this confusion. (Haydock) (Capel. iii. 20, 13.)'

      v:001: 'EZR:1:1 | 1 | 1 | In the first year {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}of Cyrus, king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord, by the mouth of Jeremias, might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of the Persians: and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and in writing also, saying:'
      v:002: 'EZR:1:2 | 2 | 2 | Thus saith Cyrus, king of the Persians: The Lord, the God of heaven, hath given to me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judea.'
      v:003: 'EZR:1:3 | 3 | 3 | Who is there among you of all his people? His God be with him. Let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord, the God of Israel; he is the God that is in Jerusalem.'
      v:004: 'EZR:1:4 | 4 | 4 | And let all the rest, in all places, wheresoever they dwell, help him every man from his place, with silver and gold, and goods, and cattle, besides that which they offer freely to the temple of God, which is in Jerusalem.'
      v:005: 'EZR:1:5 | 5 | 5 | Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Juda and Benjamin, and the priests, and Levites, and every one whose spirit God had raised up, to go up to build the temple of the Lord, which was in Jerusalem.'
      v:006: 'EZR:1:6 | 6 | 6 | And all they that were round about, helped their hands with vessels of silver, and gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with furniture, besides what they had offered on their own accord.'
      v:007: 'EZR:1:7 | 7 | 7 | And king Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the temple of the Lord, which Nabuchodonosor had taken from Jerusalem, and had put them in the temple of his god.'
      v:008: 'EZR:1:8 | 8 | 8 | Now Cyrus, king of Persia, brought them forth by the hand of Mithridates, the son of Gazabar, and numbered them to Sassabasar, the prince of Juda.'
      v:009: 'EZR:1:9 | 9 | 9 | And this is the number of them: thirty bowls of gold, a thousand bowls of silver, nine and twenty knives, thirty cups of gold,'
      v:010: 'EZR:1:10 | 10 | 10 | Silver cups of a second sort, four hundred and ten: other vessels, a thousand.'
      v:011: 'EZR:1:11 | 11 | 11 | All the vessels of gold and silver, five thousand four hundred. All these, Sassabasar brought with them that came up from the captivity of Babylon to Jerusalem.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "EZR:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Now.</i> This catalogue is given again, 2 Esdras vii. 6., and 3 Esdras v. 7., immediately (Haydock) after the long interpolated story (Kennicott) of the three guards, concerning the superior strength of wine, the king, women or truth, in which Zorobabel gains the victory, in favour of the latter. (Haydock) --- The rest of the book is taken from other inspired writings; (Sandford) and this story may be borrowed from Josephus: so that there is no reason for asserting \"that one whole book is now lost out of the sacred canon.\" (Kennicott) --- Yet this argument is by no means conclusive, as the Paralipomenon consists of such supplements, &c. These three catalogues vary considerably, not only in the proper names, but also in the numbers, (Haydock) though they must have been the same originally, and still give the same total, 42,360. We cannot find that number at present, by above 8,400. In many cases, the disagreement consists of a single unit, hundred, &c., which may lead us to suspect that the Palmyrene, or the more ancient Sidonian notation, may have been adopted in some Hebrew manuscripts, being used about the time of Christ. See Swinton's tables, (Phil. Trans. xlviii., and l.) where the Sidonian coins express the units by small perpendicular strokes; and the Palmyrene inscriptions only admit four of these together, having an arbitrary mark for 5: \"the hundreds and units after the tens, are expressed in both, in the same manner as the single units.\" (Kennicott, 2 Diss.) --- Cordell (manuscript note on this author) disapproves of this mode of correcting, and says that the females are included in the total sum, being 12,542, not recorded in the separate sums. But this number seems too small, as there are generally as many of that sex as of the other. (Haydock) --- Some find the total 31,583, which leaves 10,777 wanting to complete 42,360, as these could not make out their genealogies, or were of the ten tribes. In this chapter only 29,818 are specified, whereas [in] 2 Esdras vii. has 31,089; the latter reckons 1765 unnoticed by Esdras, who has 494 not specified in Nehemias. The difference, that seems to make a reconciliation impossible, is what makes these authors agree; for, if you add the surplus of each to the other, the same total, 31,583, will arise. (Alting. ep. 59.) This solution, though ingenious, is not solid or satisfactory. (Rondet, t. v. p. 176.) --- De Vence rather thinks that the difference is to be laid to the charge of transcribers, or that some people enrolled themselves after the registers had been made up; so that they are only included in the general sum. (Haydock) --- Some things may have been inserted from 2 Esdras, though here out of place, (Grotius) as we find similar anachronisms, 1 Paralipomenon ix. 2., and perhaps Genesis xxxvi. 31. Nehemias may also have included those whom he brought back along with these; unless we allow that some one, by attempting to reconcile the two, has thrown all into confusion. It seems undeniable, that some additions have been made to the latter book, chap. xii. 11., and 22. The list given [in] 1 Paralipomenon ix. 4., comprises only those who came first from Babylon. (Calmet) --- After this remark, it will hardly be requisite to specify all the variations of names and numbers. (Haydock) --- \"For what can be hence inferred, but that there are some arithmetical mistakes in Scripture, which no one denies?\" (Huet) --- \"Almost all who are conversant with ancient copies, agree in the decision of St. Jerome, as they cannot but perceive that some variations have crept in, particularly with respect to numbers and proper names.\" (Walton) --- <i>Province,</i> born in Chaldea, (Menochius) or rather belonging to Judea, which was now considered as a province of the empire, (Calmet) and paid tribute, chap. iv. 13., and 2 Esdras ix. 36. (Tirinus) --- In 3 Esdras, we read, \"These are they of Judea.\" --- <i>Nabuchodonosor</i> had taken some of these; the rest were chiefly their descendants. --- <i>Juda</i> now is used to denote Judea. (Haydock)"
      v:002:
        - "EZR:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Zorobabel</i> was the prince, <i>Josue</i> the high priest. (Calmet) --- There are 12 mentioned in 2 and 3 Esdras. But here the sixth Nahamani, or Enenion, is omitted. (Haydock) --- They represented the 12 tribes, (Kennicott) and were chiefs. (Menochius) --- It is wonderful that Esdras is not here mentioned, as well as Nehemias, who led a company after him, many of whom are here recorded. (Calmet) --- They might come to take care of their patrimony, and return into Chaldea, like Mardochai, (Tirinus.; though it does not seem to be Esther's uncle, Du Hamel) and Nehemias, who is styled also <i>Athersatha,</i> ver. 63. (Tirinus) --- <i>Baana.</i> 3 Esdras adds, \"their leaders.\" (Haydock)"
      v:003:
        - 'EZR:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Children.</i> When this term precedes the name of a man, it means his offspring; (ver. 3, 20.) when placed before a city, it denotes the inhabitants, ver. 21, 35. (Calmet) --- The lay Israelites are placed here; then the Levitical tribe; (ver. 36.) the Nathineans, &c., ver. 43. It is very difficult to decide when the names designate places, and when persons. (Menochius)'
      v:005:
        - 'EZR:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Seven.</i> 2 Esdras, only 652. These arrived at Jerusalem; the rest altered their mind. (Junius) (Calmet) --- But 3 Esdras has 756: so that there is most probably a mistake somewhere. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - 'EZR:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Moab.</i> This seems to be the name of a place, where the descendants of Josue and Joab might reside; (chap. viii. 4.; Calmet) or <i>Phahath</i> might have this title, on account of some victory, or residence in the country. His descendants, with those of Josue and Joab, were 2812, (Tirinus) or 2818, 2 Esdras vii. 11. (Calmet) --- <i>Josue.</i> Protestants, "Jeshua <i>and</i> Joab." (Haydock) --- Some translate Pahath, "the chief of" Moab, &c. (Du Hamel) --- Grotius suspects that to ver. 68 may be inserted from Nehemias.'
      v:013:
        - EZR:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Six.</i> Other 60 returned afterwards with Esdras. (Haydock) (Chap. viii. 13.)
      v:016:
        - 'EZR:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Ather.</i> 3 Esdras, Ator-Ezekios, 92: but 2 Esdras has <i>Ater, children of Hezecias,</i> 98. (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - 'EZR:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Besai.</i> We should perhaps read Hasum, (ver. 19.; Calmet) then Besai, and afterwards <i>Jora,</i> who may be the same with Hareph, 2 Esdras vii. 24. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'EZR:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Gebbar.</i> 2 Esdras, <i>Gabaon.</i> 3 Esdras, "Baitereus, 3005." (Haydock)'
      v:022:
        - 'EZR:2:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Six.</i> 2 Esdras puts the inhabitants of those two cities together, and makes 188, instead of the present calculation 179. (Calmet) --- Netupha was in Ephraim. (Du Hamel)'
      v:029:
        - 'EZR:2:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Nebo.</i> 2 Esdras (vii. 33.) adds, "of the other Nebo," as in some Latin copies a first had been mentioned, (ver. 30.) where we have Geba, (Calmet) here written Gabaa, ver. 26. (Haydock) --- Nebo belonged to some of the other tribes, as well as Phahath-Moab; which shews that some of the people returned, (Calmet) and are particularized, as well as the men of the three tribes of Juda, Benjamin, and Levi. (Haydock)'
      v:030:
        - 'EZR:2:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Megbis.</i> 3 Esdras, "Niphis;" (Calmet) or, according to the Alexandrian Manuscript, "Phineis." (Haydock) --- The verse is omitted [in] 2 Esdras. But Megphias occurs below, chap. x. 20. Megabyse is a Persian name. (Herodotus iii. 20., and 160.)'
      v:031:
        - 'EZR:2:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Other Elam.</i> The first is mentioned (ver. 7.) with exactly the same number. Is not this verse redundant? (Calmet) --- Who would not be astonished? (Tirinus) --- 3 Esdras omits this and the following name. (Haydock)'
      v:033:
        - 'EZR:2:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Hadid.</i> These cities were in the tribe of Benjamin. (Calmet) --- <i>Senaa</i> was in Ephraim, eight miles from Jericho. (Eusebius)'
      v:036:
        - 'EZR:2:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Josue,</i> the high priest, ver. 2.'
      v:040:
        - 'EZR:2:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Odovia,</i> called Juda, chap. iii. 9. (Calmet)'
      v:043:
        - 'EZR:2:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Nathinites,</i> "people given" (1 Paralipomenon ix. 2.; Haydock) by Josue, David, and Solomon. (Tirinus)'
      v:055:
        - 'EZR:2:55 | 55 | 55 | <i>Servants,</i> proselytes, 1 Paralipomenon xxii. 2. (Menochius)'
      v:057:
        - 'EZR:2:57 | 57 | 57 | <i>Pocereth-Hatsebaim,</i> in Hebrew (Calmet) or "of Zebaim." (Protestants)'
      v:059:
        - 'EZR:2:59 | 59 | 59 | <i>Thelmela,</i> "the height of Mela, or of salt." The river Melas empties itself into the Euphrates. (Strabo xii.) --- The cities here mentioned were in Chaldea. Some of the ten tribes had probably been transported into Cappadocia, where Herodotus (ii. 35,) place some circumcised Syrians. --- <i>Thelharsa,</i> or Thelassar, 4 Kings xix. 12. --- <i>Cherub,</i> &c., were cities of Chaldea, (Tirinus) or chief men; but as they had been carried away by Theglathphalassar, they had lost their genealogies, and could only produce circumcision as a proof that they were Israelites.'
      v:061:
        - 'EZR:2:61 | 61 | 61 | <i>Their name.</i> The priest, Berzellai, assumed the name of the family, from which he had chosen a wife. (Haydock) --- It was that of the famous old man, who was so hospitable to David, 2 Kings xix. 31. (Calmet)'
      v:062:
        - "EZR:2:62 | 62 | 62 | <i>Priesthood.</i> Those who cannot prove that they are priests, ought not to exercise the functions. (Worthington) --- The Jews were particularly careful to preserve their genealogical tables, and transcribed them again after any very troublesome times. (Josephus, contra Apion 1, and in his own Life.) --- The Rabbins falsely assert that only the mother's side was examined, and that the children followed her condition. (Calmet)"
      v:063:
        - "EZR:2:63 | 63 | 63 | <i>Athersatha.</i> Protestants' marginal note, \"the governor,\" (Haydock) in the Persian language. (Du Hamel) --- Nehemias has this title, 2 Esdras viii. 9. (Haydock) --- It means \"a cup-bearer.\" (Calmet) (Menochius) --- 3 Esdras, \"And Nehemias, <i>who is</i> also Atharias, said unto them, that they should not partake of the holy things, till a high priest, clothed with manifestation and truth, should arise.\" (Haydock) --- <i>Learned.</i> Hebrew, \"with Urim and Thummim.\" We do not find that God had been consulted, in this manner, since the time of David: and the Jews inform us that the ornament was not used after the captivity, (Calmet) as it had been, perhaps, concealed with the ark, by Jeremias, 2 Machabees ii. 4. (Tirinus) --- Nehemias hoped that it would be soon recovered. In the mean time, he followed the spirit of the law, but with additional rigour, as it permitted such priests to eat consecrated meats, Leviticus xxi. 22. It seems that this decision is out of its proper place, since Nehemias came 80 years after Zorobabel. (Calmet) --- But he might have been present on this occasion, (Haydock) though he returned afterwards to Babylon, where he officiated as cup-bearer to the king. (Tirinus)"
      v:064:
        - 'EZR:2:64 | 64 | 64 | <i>Forty-two thousand,</i> &c. Those who are reckoned up above of the tribes of Juda, Benjamin, and Levi, fall short of this number. The rest, who must be taken in to make up the whole sum, were of the other tribes. (Challoner) --- This explanation is given by R. Solomon. (Worthington) --- But we have seen that cities belonging to the ten tribes are specified. See ver. 1, and 29. (Haydock) --- Some might not be able to make out their genealogies, (Calmet) ver. 62. Yet some of these also are counted, ver. 60. (Haydock) --- The particular sums may therefore be incorrect. Josephus ([Antiquities?] xi. 1,) adds 102 to the number. (Calmet) --- 3 Esdras has, "But they were all of Israel from 12 years old and upwards, exclusive of boys and girls, (or male and female servants) 42,300." Grabe has in another character "sixty. The men and women servants of these, 7300." Then the Alexandrian Manuscript continues, "thirty-seven." So that without the addition it would give for the total, 42,337. Some copies (Haydock) have 40. (Calmet) --- But the most correct (Haydock) read 60. (Kennicott) The small number of servants and cattle shew that the people were poor. (Du Hamel)'
      v:065:
        - 'EZR:2:65 | 65 | 65 | <i>Servants.</i> Probably strangers. (Calmet) --- Yet the Hebrews might renounce their liberty, Exodus xxi. 6. (Haydock) --- <i>Hundred,</i> comprised in the last number; (Calmet) or they belong to Israel, but were different from those mentioned [in] ver. 41. We find 45 more in 2 and 3 Esdras. (Haydock) --- These might be inserted by Nehemias, after they had proved themselves to be of the tribe of Levi. (Tournemine) --- There were in all 49,942. (Haydock) So much was the power of this kingdom now reduced! Sulp Severus says above 50,000 of every sex and rank could not be found. (Haydock)'
      v:069:
        - 'EZR:2:69 | 69 | 69 | <i>Solids.</i> Hebrew <i>darcemonim.</i> (Haydock) --- "Darics," worth as much as a golden sicle. (Pelletier) (Calmet) (1 Paralipomenon xxix. 7.) --- <i>Pounds,</i> (mnas) or 60 sicles. (Menochius) --- 3 Esdras has "mnas" in both places.'
      v:070:

      v:001: 'EZR:3:1 | 1 | 1 | And {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}now the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in their cities: and the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.'
      v:002: 'EZR:3:2 | 2 | 2 | And Josue, the son of Josedec, rose up, and his brethren, the priests, and Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, and his brethren, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, that they might offer holocausts upon it: as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God.'
      v:003: 'EZR:3:3 | 3 | 3 | And they set the altar of God upon its bases, while the people of the lands, round about, put them in fear, and they offered upon it a holocaust to the Lord, morning and evening:'
      v:004: 'EZR:3:4 | 4 | 4 | And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the holocaust every day orderly, according to the commandment, the duty of the day in its day.'
      v:005: 'EZR:3:5 | 5 | 5 | And afterwards the continual holocaust, both on the new moons, and on all the solemnities of the Lord, that were consecrated, and on all in which a free-will offering was made to the Lord.'
      v:006: 'EZR:3:6 | 6 | 6 | From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer holocausts to the Lord: but the temple of God was not yet founded.'
      v:007: 'EZR:3:7 | 7 | 7 | And they gave money to hewers of stones and to masons: and meat and drink, and oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians, to bring cedar-trees from Libanus to the sea of Joppe, according to the orders which Cyrus, king of the Persians, had given them.'
      v:008: 'EZR:3:8 | 8 | 8 | And in the second year {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}of their coming to the temple of God in Jerusalem, the second month, Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, and Josue, the son of Josedec, and the rest of their brethren, the priests and Levites, and all that were come from the captivity to Jerusalem began, and they appointed Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to hasten forward the work of the Lord.'
      v:009: 'EZR:3:9 | 9 | 9 | Then Josue, and his sons, and his brethren, Cedmihel, and his sons, and the children of Juda, as one man, stood to hasten them that did the work in the temple of God: the sons of Henadad, and their sons, and their brethren, the Levites.'
      v:010: 'EZR:3:10 | 10 | 10 | And when the masons laid the foundations of the temple of the Lord, the priests stood in their ornaments with trumpets: and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise God by the hands of David, king of Israel.'
      v:011: 'EZR:3:11 | 11 | 11 | And they sung together hymns, and praise to the Lord: because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever towards Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, praising the Lord, because the foundations of the temple of the Lord were laid.'
      v:012: 'EZR:3:12 | 12 | 12 | But many of the priests and the Levites, and the chief of the fathers and the ancients, that had seen the former temple; when they had the foundation of this temple before their eyes, wept with a loud voice: and many shouting for joy, lifted up their voice.'
      v:013: 'EZR:3:13 | 13 | 13 | So that one could not distinguish the voice of the shout of joy, from the noise of the weeping of the people: for one with another the people shouted with a loud shout, and the voice was heard afar off.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'EZR:4:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Enemies;</i> Samaritans, and others, ver. 9.'
      v:002:
        - 'EZR:4:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Asor Haddan</i> sent a priest to instruct these people, but Salmanasar had transported them into the country. (Calmet) --- They continued for some time worshipping idols alone, and afterwards they consented to pay the like adoration to the Lord, 4 Kings xvii. 24, &c. (Haydock) --- It is clear, from their petition, that they had as yet no temple. The first was erected by them on Garizim, by leave of Alexander the Great, as a retreat for Manasses, brother of the Jewish high priest, and others who would not be separated from their strange wives. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xi.) --- Yet the Samaritan Chronicle, lately published, seems to give a higher antiquity to that temple, and pretends that a miracle declared in favour of the place. (Calmet) --- The fathers indeed adored there, (John iv. 20., and Genesis xii. 6,) and Josue erected an altar on Hebal, but the Samaritan copy says it was to be on Garizim, Deuteronomy xxvii. 4., and Josue viii. 30. (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - "EZR:4:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>You,</i> &c. Literally, \"It is not for you and us to build.\" But why might not these people assist in the work, as well as king Hiram or Darius? (Haydock) --- Schismatics and heretics must not communicate in sacrifices with Catholics, (Worthington) nor must the latter have society with them, in matters of religion. The Jews feared lest the Samaritans might introduce the worship of idols, or claim a part of the temple, or at least boast of what they had done. (Tirinus) --- They were aware of the insincerity of these people. (Menochius) --- The permission was moreover only granted to the Jews: (Calmet) but Cyrus had exhorted all to contribute; (chap. i. 4,) and Darius, as well as his pagan governors, were not repelled with disdain, chap. vi. 13. This treatment caused the Samaritans to be more inveterate, though the Jews were always more unwilling to come to a reconciliation. (Haydock) --- \"For the Scripture did not say, the Samaritans have no commerce with the Jews,\" says St. Chrysostom in John iv. The Jewish authors inform us, that \"Ezra, &c., gathered all the congregation into the temple, and the Levites sung and cursed the Samaritans,...that no Israelite eat of any thing that is a Samaritan's, nor that any Samaritan be proselyted to Israel, nor have any part in the resurrection,\" &c. (R. Tanchum) (Lightfoot i. p. 598.) (Kennicott) --- If this were true, it would be carrying their resentment too far; as we ought to promote the conversion of the greatest reprobates. But we have no reason to condemn such great men. They knew the character of the Samaritans, and wished to bring them to a sense of their duty, by this rebuke. (Haydock)"
      v:005:
        - "EZR:4:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Counsellors;</i> ministers of the king, (Calmet) or governors of the provinces. (Tirinus) --- <i>Cyrus,</i> who was ignorant of their machination, (Josephus) being engaged in war with the Scythians. We may easily conceive what ill-disposed ministers may do, against the inclinations of their prince. (Calmet) --- <i>Darius,</i> son of Hystaspes, who succeeded the false Smerdis, after five months' usurpation. (Calmet)"
      v:006:
        - 'EZR:4:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Assuerus;</i> otherwise called Cambyses, the son and successor of Cyrus. He is also, in the following verse, named Artaxerxes, by a name common to almost all the kings of Persia, (Calmet) after Memnon. (Diodorus xv.) Septuagint, "Arthasastha." <i>Arta</i> signifies "great," and <i>xerxes,</i> "warriour." (Herodotus vi. 98.) --- After Assuerus, some copies add, "he is Artaxerxes;" and Assuerus is so called in the Septuagint of Sixtus, 3 Esdras ii. 16. (Menochius)'
      v:007:
        - 'EZR:4:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Artaxerxes</i> may be the Oropastes of Trogus, (Calmet) or the false (Haydock) <i>Smerdis.</i> (Herodotus) --- <i>Beselam,</i> &c. These governed the provinces on the west side of the Euphrates. --- <i>Syriac</i> comprises the Chaldean, with which it has a great resemblance. It was spoken at the court of Babylon. (Xenophon vii.) See 4 Kings xviii. 26., and 2 Machabees xv. 37., and Daniel ii. 4.'
      v:008:
        - 'EZR:4:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Beelteem.</i> Syriac, "the son of Baltam." The term designates the office of Reum, "the master of reason," president of the council, treasurer, &c. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "chancellor." --- <i>From.</i> Protestants, "against." (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "concerning."'
      v:009:
        - 'EZR:4:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Counsellors.</i> Septuagint and Syriac, "of our fellow-servants." Chaldean, "colleagues." This letter, and as far as chap. vi. 16, is in the Chaldean language. --- <i>Dinites,</i> perhaps the Denarenians. (Junius) (4 Kings xvii. 24.) (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - 'EZR:4:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Asenaphar,</i> commonly supposed to be the Asarhaddon, though we know not that he caused any of these nations to remove thither, as Salmanasar certainly did. (Calmet) --- The name of the latter occurs in some copies. (Lyranus) --- <i>River,</i> Euphrates. --- <i>In peace.</i> (Haydock) --- The original, <i>ceheneth,</i> is neglected by the Septuagint and Arabic. The Syriac reads, "Acheeneth." Others translate, "at that time," as if the date had been lost. (Junius, &c.) --- Protestants, "and at such a time." (Haydock) --- Others suppose the writers lived "at Kineeth." (Pagnin) --- But who ever heard of such a place? Le Clerc takes it to mean "and the rest," as if the title were curtailed. But it is more probable that the text ought to be Ceheth, as [in] ver. 17, and that we should translate, "beyond the river, (Calmet) <i>as now,</i> (<b>11</b>) unless this word ought to be here omitted, (Haydock) to Artaxerxes, the king, peace (and prosperity) as at present." (Calmet) --- Chaldean <i>sslum ucath,</i> "peace even now." (Haydock) --- So Horace says, <i>suaviter ut nunc est,</i> wishing a continuation of happiness. 3 Esdras (ii. 17.) joins the last word with ver. 12, "And now be it," &c. <i>Canoth</i> may have this sense, (Calmet) and consequently no change is necessary. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'EZR:4:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Him.</i> This is a gloss. (Calmet) --- <i>Greeting.</i> Protestants, "and at such a time."'
      v:012:
        - 'EZR:4:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Rebellious.</i> The Jews had shewn themselves impatient of subjection, contending with the kings of Assyria and Babylon, whose territories were now possessed by the successors of Cyrus, ver. 15. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - 'EZR:4:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Revenues.</i> Septuagint, &c., include all under the term of "tribute."'
      v:014:
        - "EZR:4:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Eaten.</i> Chaldean, \"on account of the salt, with which we have been salted, from the palace.\" The king's officers were fed from his table. Salt is put for all their emoluments; (Calmet) and hence the word <i>salary</i> is derived. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxi. 7.) We may also translate, \"because we have demolished the temple, and because,\" &c. (Kimchi; Grotius, &c.) But this seems to refined. (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"Now because we have maintenance from <i>the king's</i> palace, and it is not meet,\" &c. To have neglected their master's interests, would have betrayed great ingratitude and perfidy; particularly if they had entered into a <i>covenant of salt,</i> or solemnly engaged to be ever faithful servants, as the nature of their office implied, Numbers xviii. 19., and 2 Paralipomenon xiii. 5. (Haydock) --- <i>Palace,</i> being honoured with much distinction. (Delrio, adag. 215.)"
      v:015:
        - 'EZR:4:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Fathers,</i> the preceding emperors, Nabuchodonosor, Salmanasar, &c. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - 'EZR:4:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Possession.</i> Septuagint have simply, "peace."'
      v:017:
        - 'EZR:4:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Greeting.</i> Protestants, "peace, and at such a time," which has no great meaning. (Haydock) See ver. 10.'
      v:019:
        - 'EZR:4:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Seditions:</i> so are styled the just efforts of the Jews, to keep or to regain their liberty. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - 'EZR:4:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Kings;</i> only David and Solomon. (Menochius) --- They had made some on the east side of the river pay tribute, though the king may speak of the countries on the west.'

The immediate descendants of Azarias may be found, 1 Paralipomenon vi.

(Calmet) --- The gospel sometimes gives the title of <i>scribe</i> to the doctors of the law, Matthew xxii. 35., with Mark xii. 28. It is peculiarly due to Esdras, who gave a correct copy of the Scriptures, and wrote them in a different character, leaving the ancient one to the Samaritans, that the people might be less connected. (Bellarmine, De Verb. xx. 1, citing (Tirinus) the most learned Fathers and Jewish writers. (Calmet, Diss.) --- The author of 4 Esdras (xiv. 19,) intimates that the sacred books had been all destroyed, and were dictated again to Esdras by the Holy Spirit. But this book is not of sufficient authority to establish so dangerous an opinion; (Haydock) which is refuted by the whole context of the Bible, in which we see that the law was never forgotten. (Calmet, Diss.) (Du Hamel) --- As Esdras was inspired, what additions he might make, must be accounted divine and authentic. (Calmet) --- <i>Hand;</i> protection, (Delrio, adag. 217,) or inspiration.

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "This Book taketh its name from the writer, who was a holy priest and doctor of the law. He is called by the Hebrews <i>Ezra,</i> (Challoner) and was son, (Tirinus) or rather, unless he lived above 150 years, a descendant of Saraias, 4 Kings xxv. 18. It is thought that he returned first with Zorobabel; and again, at the head of other captives, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, with ample authority. Esdras spent the latter part of his life in exhorting the people, and in explaining to them the law of God. He appeared with great dignity at the dedication of the walls of Jerusalem, 2 Esdras xii. 26, 35. We have four books which bear his name. (Calmet) --- This and the following book of Nehemias, originally made but one in Hebrew, (St. Jerome, &c.) as the transactions of both those great men are recorded. The third and fourth are not in Hebrew nor received into the canon of the Holy Scriptures, though the Greek Church hold the third as canonical, and place it first; (Worthington) and Genebrard would assert that both ought to be received, as they were by several Fathers. But they contain many thing which appear to be erroneous, and have been rejected by others of great authority, and particularly by St. Jerome. The third book seems to have been written very early, by some Hellenist Jew, who was desirous of embellishing the history of Zorobabel; and the fourth was probably composed by some person of the same nation, who had been converted to Christianity, before the end of the second century; and who injudiciously attempted to convert his brethren, by assuming the name of a man who was so much respected. Many things have been falsely attributed to Esdras, on the same account. It is said that he invented the Masora; restored the Scriptures, which had been lost; fixed the canon of twenty-two books; substituted the Chaldaic characters instead of the ancient Hebrew, Samaritan, or Ph≈ìnician. But though Esdras might sanction the latter, now become common, the characters might vary insensibly, (Bianconi; Kennicott, Dis. ii.) as those of other languages have done, (Haydock) and the sacred books never perished wholly; nor could the canon be determined in the time of Esdras. (Calmet) --- As for the Masoretic observations and points, they are too modern an invention. (Elias Levita; Capel.; Houbigant, &c.) --- What we know more positively of Esdras, is, (Worthington) that he was empowered by Artaxerxes to bring back the Jews, and that he acted with great zeal. (Haydock) --- This book contains the transactions of 82 years, till the year of the world 3550. The letter of Reum, and the king's answer, (chap. iv. 7., till chap. vi. 19., as well as chap. vii. 12, 27.) are in Chaldean; the rest of the work is in Hebrew. (Calmet) --- We may discover various mysteries concealed under the literal sense of this and the following book. (St. Jerome, ep. ad Paulin.) (Worthington) --- Esdras is supposed by this holy doctor, as well as by some of the Rabbins, &c., to have been the same person with the prophet Malachy[Malachias]; (Button) and several reasons seem to support this conjecture, though it must still remain very uncertain. (Calmet) --- Some think that (Haydock) Esdras wrote only the four last chapters, and the author of Paralipomenon the six preceding ones. (Du Hamel) --- But it is most probable that he compiled both from authentic documents. (Haydock) --- Some few additions may have been inserted since, by divine authority, 2 Esdras xii. 11, 22. (Tirinus)"
