      v:011:
        - 'SIR:3:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Foundations.</i> St. Augustine (City of God xxii. 8.) gives a memorable instance. The pagans deemed such curses most terrible. (Orpheus) (Genesis ix. 25.) --- They are executed upon the wicked.'

        - 'SIR:3:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>A father.</i> Greek, "mother." Alexander [the Great] was ashamed of having Philip for his father, pretending that he was the son of Jupiter Ammon. His mother Olympias, with much ingenuity, wrote to him, that he would thus make Juno her powerful rival!'
      v:015:
        - 'SIR:3:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Fail. Bis pueri senes.</i> They do not lose the character of fathers, how infirm soever, (Calmet) and those can never truly serve the invisible Deity, who despise their fathers, his visible images on the earth. (Philo; Decal.)'

        - 'SIR:3:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Greater.</i> The dignity of a person should be the measure of his humility, (St. Ambrose, de virg. 31.) as the most elevated are the most exposed to pride. Humility is taught only by true wisdom and the gospel, Matthew xi. 29. Philosophy may inspire us with the contempt of riches, &c. (Calmet) --- Yet humility is the most indispensable duty, and no less essential than <i>delivery</i> to an orator. (St. Augustine, ep. 118. ad Diosc.) --- All human greatness comes from God, who requires us to shew our gratitude by humility. (Worthington)'
      v:022:
        - 'SIR:3:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>In,</i> &c. The mysterious nature of God and providence, cannot be comprehended: and in many things we must confess our ignorance. Life is often spent in idle researches.'

        - 'SIR:3:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Suspicion.</i> Greek Complutensian, "their vain suspicion hath deceived many and <i>their</i> wicked thought has ruined their judgment. Not having the apples of the eye, thou wilt be deprived of light; and being ignorant, do not speak." The latter sentence is marked by Grabe as wanting in his copy, as it is in the Vatican, if we may believe the London edition, (Haydock) which, however, is not an exact copy, no more than any of the other editions, of that famous manuscript. (Grabe)'
      v:027:
        - 'SIR:3:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Heart.</i> Which fears neither God nor man. (St. Bernard, cons. 1.) --- Those who have not shewn mercy, can expect none. (Haydock) --- The impenitent see their folly, like Antiochus, when it is too late. (Calmet) --- They have loved the <i>danger,</i> which shall overtake them, Proverbs i. 26. He seems to refute those who believed in fate, and would take no precautions. (Calmet) --- Those who live in sin, tempting God to the last hour, generally perish. (Worthington)'
      v:029:

(Calmet) --- <i>Resist.</i> Greek, "shall expiate, <i>or</i> obtain pardon for sins," Daniel iv. 24., and Luke xi. 41. "Alms-deeds are a sort of baptism, which may be often repeated" to advantage. (St. Ambrose, or. Max.) --- "When we bestow any thing, it is not of our own, but the gift of Christ. We give bread....He, <i>the poor,</i> renders us the kingdom of heaven." (St. Jerome in Psalm cxxxiii.) God becomes our debtor. (St. Chrysostom, hom. liii., and lviii.) --- Our inheritance is secured. (St. Cyprian, de Op.) --- But then charity and repentance must accompany our alms. (St. Augustine, City of God 21. ultra.[last chapter])'

Tox.) and Aristotle (Eth. ix. 10.) commends this maxim of Hesiod: {GREEK:START mete poluxeinos met azeinos}μητη πολυξηινοσ μητ αζηινοσ{GREEK:END}; "neither to have too many guests, <i>or</i> intimate friends, nor to be without any."'
      v:007:
        - 'SIR:6:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Get.</i> Literally, "dost possess a friend, possess him in trial," (Haydock) as the Greek also has it. But the Hebrew term <i>kanah,</i> means likewise, "to acquire," and a friend ought to be chosen with judgment. It is too late to try him after he has been received. (Calmet) --- One must try much before a companion be chosen, that he may be afterwards preserved. (Plut.[Plutarch?]) --- "Possess not friends quickly, but those whom thou hast obtained, reject not with disgrace." (Solon; Laertius i., and ii. 8.)'

        - 'SIR:6:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>And immortality,</i> is not in Greek. (Calmet) --- But shews the meaning of <i>life</i> is this place; as a true friend will not cease to give good advice for eternity. (Haydock) --- But even in this world, nothing can be more advantageous. (Calmet) --- <i>Amicus magis necessarius est quam ignis et aqua.</i> (Cicero) (St. Ambrose, off iii.) --- <i>Him.</i> Cicero himself says, "friendship can subsist only among the virtuous." Yet these, judging others by themselves, are more easily imposed upon, and ought, therefore, to address themselves to God. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'SIR:6:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Be.</i> He will instill into his friend sentiments of piety, if he have them not before. <i>Amicitia similes invenit aut facit.</i> "Pythagoras desires that in friendship one should be formed of many." (Cicero v. 11.) (Haydock)'

      v:022:
        - "SIR:6:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Trial.</i> Such stones were used to try people's strength, (Zacharias xii. 3.; Calmet) or to try gold. (Vatable) --- The Syriac explains it of a precious stone. But the first idea is preferable. Many will not so much as attempt to become acquainted with wisdom and piety."
      v:023:
        - 'SIR:6:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Name.</i> Perhaps the author may compare the Greek word Sophia, (Calmet) with <i>Tsopuie,</i> (Haydock) "hidden," or with the Greek term, <i>zophos,</i> which means "darkness." See chap. xliii. 8,. and xlvi. 1. The original Hebrew test is lost, so that we cannot determine to what word allusion is made. See Cornelius a Lapide, who has written the best commentary on this book. --- <i>But,</i> &c., is not in Greek. (Calmet) --- Many prefer learning before piety. But St. Augustine says, the unlearned rise and take the kingdom of heaven, while we with our learning, devoid of heart, (or charity; Haydock) behold we fall into the dirt. (Confessions viii. 8.) (Worthington)'

      v:030:
        - 'SIR:6:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Firm.</i> Literally, "bases of virtue;" (Haydock) which is not in Greek, and rather embarrasses the sentence; (Calmet) though it may signify, that if we serve the Lord with fidelity, our building will never be overturned. (Haydock)'
      v:035:
        - 'SIR:6:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Wise.</i> Literally, "prudent." The Latin has this epithet, because old people are not always such, though it may be expected of them. (Calmet) --- "While wisdom increases, all other faculties decrease." (St. Jerome, ad Nepot.)'
      v:036:
        - 'SIR:6:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Morning,</i> with the utmost diligence. (Calmet) --- "The very meeting of the wise is of advantage; and thou mayst learn something of a great man, though he open not his mouth." (Seneca, ep. xciv.)'

David's valour excited the hatred of Saul, and Alexander \"was indignant that Antipater (his general; Haydock) had conquered, thinking his own glory was diminished by that which another acquired.\" (Curt. vi.)"

Many suppose that both allude to the fire which burnt dead bodies, &c., in the vale of Hinnon. But all allow that the inextinguishable flames of hell are meant. Whether the fire and worms be corporeal or not has been questioned: the Greek Fathers, and the Church of Florence, generally maintain the negative, and the Latins assert it on better grounds. St. Thomas Aquinas adopts the opinion of many of the Fathers, who explain the worm to denote the remorse of conscience. Yet many take it to be a <i>worm,</i> though not like those with which we are acquainted. <i>Horreo vermem mendacem et mortem vivacem.</i> (St. Bernard, cons. v.) See St. Jerome; Isaias lxvi.; Cornelius a Lapide; St. Gregory, Dial. iv. 29.; St. Augustine, City of God xx. 10.; St. Ambrose vii. in Luke xiv.)

And the same has always been continued from the days of the apostles in the Church of the New Testament.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'SIR:18:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Together,</i> as to their substance, though they received different forms successively, as Moses relates. Both writers are divinely inspired. (St. Augustine, de Gen. ad Lit. iv. 33.) (Worthington) (St. Thomas Aquinas, i. p. 974. a. 2.) --- Some suppose that all things were really formed in an instant, and that the order described by Moses is only as we should conceive it. (Cajetan) --- This passage only means that God alone was the creator both of the sun and of man, and <i>without him nothing was made,</i> (John i., and Psalm xxxii. 15.) as he gave existence to all, {GREEK:START koine}κοινη{GREEK:END}, "in common." (Calmet) --- <i>And he.</i> Greek, "and there is no other besides him who steers the world with the palm of his hand. And all things obey his will; for he is king of all, in his might, separating what is holy among them from the profane. (<b>2.</b>) He has enabled no one to," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - 'SIR:18:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Added.</i> The works speak for themselves, though man be silent. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'SIR:18:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Begin.</i> God is so great and incomprehensible, that when man has done all that he can to find out his greatness and boundless perfections, he is still to begin: for what he has found out, is but a mere nothing, in comparison of his infinity. (Challoner) --- It is best to adore him in silence and humility. (Calmet)<br>'
      v:007:
        - 'SIR:18:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Grace.</i> Greek, "utility." (Haydock) --- <i>Evil.</i> What can man do for or against God? Job xxii. 3., and Psalm xv. 2.'
      v:008:
        - 'SIR:18:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Years.</i> Seneca fixes on the same number; (Brev. Vitæ. 3.) Macrobius on seventy, for the life of man; which nearly agrees with the author of Psalm lxxxix. 10. (Haydock) --- It seldom happens that people exceed 70, or 100 years. But what is this compared with eternity? (Calmet) --- Greek, "a hundred years are many....so are a thousand years in the day of the age," or of {GREEK:START aionos}αιονοσ{GREEK:END}, eternity. (Haydock) (Psalm lxxxix. 4., and 2 Peter iii. 8.)'

      v:012:
        - 'SIR:18:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Flesh.</i> It is infinite and disinterested. Man assists his neighbour expecting a recompense, and remembering that he may be distressed.'
      v:014:
        - 'SIR:18:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Judgments.</i> To execute his orders. Here ends the discourse begun [in] chap. xiv. 22. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - 'SIR:18:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Complaint.</i> Greek, "reproach." (Haydock) --- The manner of giving, enhances the value of the gift, or even surpasses it. (Calmet){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>-----Super omnia vultus</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Accessere boni, nec iners pauperque voluntas.</i> ([Ovid?] Met. 8.)'
      v:020:
        - 'SIR:18:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Medicine.</i> This is more requisite and easy to do in the maladies of the soul, which are brought on by our own fault. <i>Principiis obsta.</i> (Calmet) --- <i>Mercy.</i> Greek, "propitiation in the hour of visitation," (Haydock) or punishment. (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - 'SIR:18:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Sick.</i> Roman Greek adds, "by abstinence, and in the time of sins, manifest a conversion." (Haydock) --- If we take precautions to avoid illness, why should we neglect the concerns of our soul? --- <i>Conversation,</i> or good conduct.'
      v:022:
        - 'SIR:18:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Always.</i> These admirable maxims seem copied from the gospel, Luke xviii. 1. (Calmet) --- The same spirit dictated all the Scriptures. (Haydock) --- Those pray always who neglect not this duty at proper times, and are always resolved to do so. (St. Augustine, ep. 121. q. ad Prob.) (Worthington) --- Greek, "be not hindered from performing thy vow in good time, and wait not to be justified, (Haydock) <i>or</i> to put it in execution till death. Deuteronomy xxiii. 21. Before thou takest a vow," &c. Examine well if thou intend to perform it. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - 'SIR:18:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>God.</i> Can we expect that he will hear what we do not ourselves? To approach his majesty, without repentance and attention, is presumptuous. We must ask God to <i>open our lips,</i> and do what lies in us. (Trid.[Council of Trent?]) (Calmet)'
      v:024:
        - 'SIR:18:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Face,</i> saying to the reprobate, <i>Depart,</i> &c., chap. vii. 40., and Matthew xxv. 41. (Haydock)'
      v:025:
        - 'SIR:18:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Riches.</i> By their good use, lay up a treasure in heaven, and be always humble, chap. xi. 27.'
      v:026:
        - 'SIR:18:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>God.</i> All things continually change. (Calmet) --- <i>Rotam volubili orbe versamus.</i> (Boet. cons. 2.) --- Reflect on Aman and Mardochai. (Calmet){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Quem dies vidit veniens superbum,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Hunc dies vidit fugiens jacentem.</i> (Sen.[Seneca?] Thyeste.)'
      v:027:
        - 'SIR:18:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Thing.</i> Mindful of the reverses of fortune, chap. xi. 30., and Proverbs xxviii. 14. (Calmet) --- <i>Sloth,</i> and repent. Greek adds, "the fool will not observe the season." (Haydock)'
      v:028:
        - SIR:18:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Her.</i> It is a rare thing to discern and to give due praise to merit. (Calmet)
      v:029:
        - 'SIR:18:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>And judgments.</i> Greek, "full of accuracy." Some add the title "restraint of the soul." (Haydock)'
      v:031:
        - SIR:18:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Enemies.</i> This motive will make the most impression on those who are slaves to their passions. (Calmet)
      v:032:
        - 'SIR:18:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Small.</i> Literally, "nor in those which are small." (Haydock) --- Composed of the meanest citizens. Quarrels and sin are there almost inevitable. (Calmet) --- Greek, "rejoice not in high living; nor beg for its symbol," (Haydock) or feast, in which each person contributed his share,<i> <u>sumbole</u>,</i> as the next verse implies. (Calmet) --- <i>Symbolum dedit, cænavit.</i> (Ter.[Tertullian?] And.)'

(Challoner) --- This was the source of continual dissensions. (Josephus, [Jewish Antiquities?] xi. 8., and xii. 2.) (John iv. 20.) --- The Jews and Samaritans are still at variance. The former, in the days of Esdras, pronounced a curse against the latter, forbidding any of them to become converts to their religion, (Grotius) which, if true, shews a very blameable malice. See Deuteronomy xxvii. 4. (Haydock) --- <i>Which,</i> &c., is omitted in Greek. These three nations had evinced the greatest hatred towards the Jews, and thus deserved to be accounted objects of horror, though if the author harboured any ill-will, his conduct is not praised, (Calmet) but only recorded.

      v:011: 'SIR:50:11 | 11 | 11 | As an olive-tree budding forth, and a cypress-tree rearing itself on high, when he put on the robe of glory, and was clothed with the perfection of power.'

        - 'SIR:51:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Sirach.</i> This prayer may be in imitation of the book of Wisdom. (Haydock) --- Grotius assigns it to the grandson, without reason; as the author continues to speak of his travels, &c. He seems to have lived under Onias III and under Seleucus and Antiochus Epiphanes, of Syria, to whom he was probably accused, and hence took occasion to retire into Egypt, where Ptolemy Epiphanes was king. (Calmet) --- Others think (Haydock) that he was accused before Ptolemy Lagus, when he took Jerusalem. (Menochius) --- We know too little of his life to decide any thing. (Calmet) See chap. l. 1. (Haydock) --- <i>Saviour.</i> When we are not able to make a return, we must shew greater marks of gratitude, and particularly to God, for the favours which we have not deserved. (Worthington)'

        - 'SIR:51:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Gates.</i> Greek, "many." (Haydock) --- He exaggerates the danger to which he was exposed, as he was not miraculously delivered from the flames, &c., (Calmet) though this might be the case. At least he thanks God for preserving him (Haydock) from the various torments which were then in use.'

        - 'SIR:51:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>The Father.</i> Grotius asserts boldly, that it should be, "my Father," and that some Christian has changed this. But his authority may be rejected, when he brings no proof; and Bossuet has solidly refuted him. The passage clearly proves the belief of the second person, and seems to allude to Psalm cix. 1.

        - 'SIR:51:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>The time.</i> It is never too soon to be wise. <i>In doing good let us not fail,</i> (Galatians vi. 9.) in order to obtain that <i>food,</i> which remains for ever, Isaias vi. 7. <i>Fear God, and keep his commandments, for this is all man,</i> Ecclesiastes xii. 13.

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - 'This book is so called from the Greek word that signifies <i>a preacher:</i> because, like an excellent preacher, it gives admirable lessons of all virtues. The author was Jesus, the son of Sirach, of Jerusalem, who flourished about two hundred years before Christ. As it was written after the time of Esdras, it is not in the Jewish canon; but is received as canonical and divine by the Catholic Church, instructed by apostolical tradition, and directed by the Spirit of God. It was first written in Hebrew, but afterwards translated into Greek by another Jesus, the grandson of the author, whose prologue to this book is the following: (Challoner)'
  - THE PROLOGUE.
  - 'The knowledge of many and great things hath been shewn us by the law, and the prophets, and others that have followed them: for which things Israel is to be commended for doctrine and wisdom: because not only they that speak must needs be skilful, but strangers also both speaking and writing, may <em>by their means</em> become most learned.  My grandfather, Jesus, after he had much given himself to a diligent reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books, that were delivered to us from our fathers, had a mind also to write something himself, pertaining to doctrine and wisdom; that such as are desirous to learn, and are made knowing in these things, may be more and more attentive in mind, and be strengthened to live according to the law.  I entreat you, therefore, to come with benevolence, and to read with attention, and to pardon us for those things wherein we may seem, while we follow the image of wisdom, to come short in the composition of words; for the Hebrew words have not the same force in them, when translated into another tongue.  And not only these, but the law also itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language.  For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Ptolemy Evergetes was king, and continuing there a long time, I found there books left, of no small nor comtemptible learning.  Therefore I thought it good, and necessary for me to bestow some diligence and labour to interpret this book: and with much watching and study, in some space of time, I brought the book to an end, and set it forth for the service of them that are willing to apply their mind, and to learn how they ought to conduct themselves, who purpose to lead their life according to the law of the Lord.'
  - "--- If some forbear to urge the authority of this book, in disputes with the Jews, we need not be surprised, as there were other proofs against them. We often act with Protestants in the same manner, even using their versions, &c. (Haydock) --- It was alleged in the controversies about baptism and grace, and no one thought of rejecting its testimony, chap. xxxiv. 30. (St. Cyprian, ep. 65.; St. Augustine, Bap. vi. 34., and Grat. ii. 11., &c.) --- The Councils of Ephesus, 3d Carthage, (c. 47.) Francfort, 8th Toledo, and Trent, ought to settle all doubts on this head. The Jews themselves have a great regard for the book, (though the Thalmud condemns it for admitting more persons than one in God) and seem to have copied many sentences from it into the two Syriac alphabets of Ben Sira. This may be the work which St. Jerome (Pref. in Sal.) testifies he saw in Hebrew, as that text cannot at present be found. (Calmet) --- See ep. 115. (Du Hamel) --- But this is no proof that it was not extant in St. Jerome's time, and the many variations between the Greek copies themselves and the Vulgate, may owe their rise to the different translators omitting some parts of it. (Haydock) --- The same person seems to have translated this and the former book [Wisdom] into Latin in the earliest ages, though the present work is more obscure, because the Greek is less beautiful, of which the Roman edition is deemed the most correct; though the Complutensian agrees with the Vulgate. He appears to have given frequently a double version, for fear of not having expressed the full sense in the first, unless the additions be his, or some other person's <i>glosses,</i> which have crept into the text. (Calmet) --- If this be the case, near one hundred verses ought to be cut off, yet as they are published without any distinction by the Church, perhaps it would be as well to adhere to the former sentiment, or to suspend our judgment, chap. ix. 12. (Haydock) --- Many of the Fathers quote this book as the production of Solomon, because it contains many of his sentences preserved by tradition, (Menochius) and resembles his works. (St. Augustine, City of God xvii. 20.) --- The Greek styles it \"The Wisdom of Jesus, the son of Sirach.\" He has imitated (Haydock) the <i>Proverbs</i> to chap. xxiv., <i>Ecclesiastes</i> to chap. xlii. 15., where wisdom ends her exhortation, and the <i>Canticle</i> [<i>of Canticles</i>] in the remainder of the work, praising God and the great men of the nation, down to Simon II. (Vales in Eusebius iv. 22.) (Calmet) --- The last chapter contains a <i>prayer,</i> which may be in imitation of the book of <i>Wisdom.</i> This work is often styled <i>Panaretos,</i> a collection of pious maxims, (Haydock) or a \"receptacle of all virtues.\" (Worthington) --- Many think it was composed between the year of the world 3711 and 3783; (Torniel.) but it seem rather to have appeared in times of persecution, (chap. 36.) after Philopator had been incensed against Simon II for opposing his entrance into the sanctuary, (chap. l. 4., &c.) for which he ordered the Jews in Egypt to be cruelly butchered, (2 Machabees) and after Epiphanes, the Syrian monarch, had commenced his most cruel persecution of that people, and of Onias III, twenty-two years after the death of Simon II, (chap. xxxv., and l.) the year of the world 3828, the year before Christ 176. (Eusebius; Grotius; Usher) (Calmet)"
