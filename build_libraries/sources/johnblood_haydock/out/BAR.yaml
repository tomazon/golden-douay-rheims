    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'BAR:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Babylonia.</i> Septuagint, "Babylon," where Jechonias was in prison, (Haydock) now the 5th year, ver. 2. Baruch accompanied his brother Saraias, Jeremias li. 59. (Calmet) --- Cappellus supposes that the author confounded them together, which is not probable. (Houbigant)'
      v:002:
        - 'BAR:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Month,</i> in which the king was taken. (Calmet) --- This was the fifth anniversary. (Haydock) --- <i>Fire:</i> but soon extinguished. (Usher) --- The taking of the city was effected at intervals, (Haydock) during eleven years, in the fifth of which this book was written. Jerusalem was at last reduced to ashes. As yet there were priests, a temple, &c., ver. 7, 14. (Worthington) (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'BAR:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Jechonias.</i> He was in prison, where the Jews met to hear the words of Jeremias; (li. 59., &c.; Calmet) or the king might hear the letter in private. (Houbigant)'
      v:004:
        - 'BAR:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Sodi.</i> Hebrew <i>zud,</i> (Haydock) means "pride," and probably denotes the great river Euphrates. (Calmet) --- Bochart reads Sur, (Houbigant) or Sori. The city Sura was there. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'BAR:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Joakim,</i> or Eliacim, high priest under Manasses, &c., Isaias xxii. 20. (Calmet) --- The text only says that he was priest, and Cappellus asserts there was no pontiff then. (Houbigant)'
      v:008:
        - 'BAR:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Siven;</i> a Syriac month, corresponding with our May. (Menochius) --- <i>Vessels;</i> or, "the vessels <i>were</i> of silver." (Haydock) --- By retrenching {GREEK:START a}α{GREEK:END}, which, it would seem that they asked for the golden vessels. Sedecias had made silver ones to supply their place. These also might have been taken away. (Calmet) --- Baltassar had still those of gold, (Daniel v. 2.; Menochius) or at least some of them. (Haydock) --- Sedecias, now in favour, only asked for what he had made while a private man. (Houbigant)'
      v:009:
        - 'BAR:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>All. Cunctos</i> should be <i>vinclos,</i> according to the Greek, "prisoners." (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - 'BAR:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Meat.</i> Literally, "manna," as Septuagint express Hebrew <i>monee;</i> (Haydock) or as it is pointed, <i>mincha;</i> which properly means an "oblation" (Jeremias xvii. 26.; Menochius) of bread, wine, &c. (Calmet) --- <i>And offerings.</i> Literally, "offer." --- Greek has <i>for sin</i> before <i>frankincense.</i> (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - "BAR:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>King.</i> Gratitude and duty prompted them, Jeremias xxix. 7., and 1 Timothy ii. 2. --- <i>Baltassar.</i> Evilmerodac, his elder brother, was in disgrace. (Lyranus) (Jeremias lii. 31.) (Calmet) --- <i>Heaven,</i> as long and prosperous as possible. (Haydock) --- It was a customary salutation to say, <i>O king, live for ever,</i> Daniel ii. 4., and Psalm lxxxviii. 30. (Calmet) --- Cappellus says Baltassar was not yet born. But how does he know this? It might be the title of the heir apparent, (Haydock) or of the king's sons. We need not decide in a point of such antiquity. (Houbigant)"
      v:012:
        - "BAR:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Eyes,</i> putting an end to our captivity, (Badwell) or causing us to detest our sins. (Calmet) --- <i>Days.</i> This they knew was God's decree, and they submit. (Haydock) --- They prefer serving the Chaldeans before other foreign nations. (Worthington)"
      v:014:
        - 'BAR:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Proper</i> festival <i>days.</i> (Calmet) --- Hebrew <i>mohed,</i> or <i>muad.</i> They were still observed (Haydock) in the temple.'
      v:020:
        - 'BAR:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Curses</i> against transgressors, Leviticus xxvi., and Daniel ix. 11. (Calmet) --- <i>Day.</i> We feel the effects of sin. The land of Juda was not flourishing, though not yet laid waste. (Haydock)'
      v:022:
        - 'BAR:1:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Serve,</i> or sacrifice unto: (Sanctius) <i>operata Deo:</i> (Tibul.) or to worship, chap. ii. 21. (Calmet)'

      v:004: 'BAR:1:4 | 4 | 4 | And in the hearing of the nobles, the sons of the kings, and in the hearing of the ancients, and in the hearing of the people, from the least even to the greatest of them, that dwelt in Babylonia, by the river Sodi.'
      v:005: 'BAR:1:5 | 5 | 5 | And when they heard it they wept, and fasted, and prayed before the Lord.'
      v:006: "BAR:1:6 | 6 | 6 | And they made a collection of money, according to every man's power."
      v:007: 'BAR:1:7 | 7 | 7 | And they sent <i>it</i> to Jerusalem, to Joakim, the priest, the son of Helcias, the son of Salom, and to the priests, and to all the people, that were found with him in Jerusalem:'
      v:008: 'BAR:1:8 | 8 | 8 | At the time when he received the vessels of the temple of the Lord, which had been taken away out of the temple, to return them into the land of Juda, the tenth day of the month Sivan, the silver vessels, which Sedecias, the son of Josias, king of Juda, had made.'
      v:009: 'BAR:1:9 | 9 | 9 | After that, Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon, had carried away Jechonias, and the princes, and all the powerful men, and the people of the land from Jerusalem, and brought them bound to Babylon.'
      v:010: 'BAR:1:10 | 10 | 10 | And they said: Behold we have sent you money, buy with it holocausts, and frankincense, and make meat-offerings, and offerings for sin at the altar of the Lord our God:'

      v:012: 'BAR:1:12 | 12 | 12 | And that the Lord may give us strength, and enlighten our eyes, that we may live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor, the king of Babylon, and under the shadow of Baltasaar, his son, and may serve them many days, and may find favour in their sight.'
      v:013: 'BAR:1:13 | 13 | 13 | And pray ye for us to the Lord our God: for we have sinned against the Lord our God, and his wrath is not turned away from us even to this day.'

    commentary:
      v:002:
        - 'BAR:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Heaven.</i> After the death of Josias, the nation was exposed to the greatest misery. Its kings were imprisoned by the Egyptians, and then by the Chaldeans; and surprising changes took place, all during the space of eight or nine years.'
      v:003:
        - 'BAR:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Daughter.</i> This is not mentioned in sacred history to have happened when this was written, (Calmet) except in the siege of Samaria. Some of the captives of Israel might be now at Babylon, as the places to which they had been sent were under the same king; and they confess their common transgressions and chastisements. All distinction of the kingdoms was now at an end. Some might also have been reduced to this extremity, when Joakim or Jechonias were besieged and taken. (Haydock) --- We should not know that a similar distress prevailed under Sedecias, if it had not been specified [in] Lamentations ii. 20., and iv. 10. This prayer greatly resembles that of Daniel ix. 4.'
      v:004:
        - 'BAR:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Kings</i> of Egypt and Babylon, while the Ammonites, &c., derided us.'
      v:005:
        - 'BAR:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Under;</i> a proverbial expression, Deuteronomy xxviii. 13.'
      v:009:
        - 'BAR:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Watched,</i> to punish. When he spares, he seems to slumber, Jeremias xliv. 27. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - "BAR:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Justices.</i> So God's law is frequently called, (Psalm cxviii.) because its observance makes us just. (Worthington)"
      v:016:
        - 'BAR:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>House:</i> the temple, or from heaven. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - "BAR:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Justice,</i> &c. They that are in hell shall not give justice to God: that is, they shall not acknowledge and glorify his justice, as penitent sinners do upon earth. (Challoner) --- And all in the grave are incapable of making known God's perfections. An appeal to his glory is thus often made, Isaias xxxviii. 18., Psalm cxiii. 17., and Ecclesiasticus vii. 24."
      v:018:
        - 'BAR:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Of evil</i> is not in Greek. A soul which bears grandeur with pain, like Esther, and humbles itself before God, is most graciously received. (Haydock) --- <i>Fail,</i> by fasting. Such are the dispositions required for prayer, Psalm lxviii. 3.'
      v:019:
        - 'BAR:2:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Fathers.</i> Greek adds, "and kings." --- <i>Prayers.</i> Greek, "mercy." We boast not of our good works. (Haydock) --- Mercy may denote prayer or humiliation. Theodoret gives a better sense: (Calmet) "We trust not in the just works of our fathers, or of ourselves, to receive any pity." (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - 'BAR:2:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Serve,</i> as Jeremias (xxv. 9., and xxvii. 7., and xxviii. 14.) repeatedly admonished.'
      v:023:
        - 'BAR:2:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Footstep.</i> It shall become a desert, Isaias xxxiii. 8., and Lamentations i. 4.'
      v:024:
        - 'BAR:2:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Place.</i> The soldiers ransacked the tombs in hopes of plunder. Joakim was left unburied. This would be very afflicting to the Jews, Jeremias viii. 1., and xxii. 19., and xxxvi. 30. (Calmet)'
      v:025:
        - 'BAR:2:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Banishment.</i> Syriac, "captivity;" (Theodoret) or "by pestilence inflicted by God:" {GREEK:START apostole}αποστολη{GREEK:END}. (Grotius) (Jeremias xxxii. 36.)'
      v:026:
        - 'BAR:2:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Day.</i> Its vessels were taken away, (chap. i. 8.) and few were left to attend. (Calmet) --- Grotius answers this difficulty. (Houbigant) --- The prophet foresees the event. (Worthington)'
      v:030:
        - 'BAR:2:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Heart,</i> and be seriously converted, (Haydock) as the prophets had foretold, Osee ii. 7., &c.'
      v:033:
        - 'BAR:2:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Neck.</i> Literally, "back," insensible of stripes. (Calmet)'
      v:034:
        - 'BAR:2:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Thereof.</i> Literally, "of them;" <i>eis.</i> But <i>ei</i> is more (Haydock) conformable to the Greek. (Calmet)'
      v:035:
        - 'BAR:2:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Another.</i> Greek, "an everlasting covenant," (Haydock) by Christ, (Maldonat) prefigured by that which Nehemias renewed, 2 Esdras ix. 38. (Calmet) --- The law of Moses was in force till Christ came. His law continues unto the end. (Worthington)'

      v:002: 'BAR:2:2 | 2 | 2 | That the Lord would bring upon us great evils, <i>such</i> as never happened under heaven, as they have come to pass in Jerusalem, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}according to the things that are written in the law of Moses:'

      v:011: 'BAR:2:11 | 11 | 11 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And now, O Lord God of Israel, who hast brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand, and with signs, and with wonders, and with thy great power, and with a mighty arm, and hast made thee a name as at this day,'
      v:012: 'BAR:2:12 | 12 | 12 | We have sinned, we have done wickedly, we have acted unjustly, O Lord our God, against all thy justices.'
      v:013: 'BAR:2:13 | 13 | 13 | Let thy wrath be turned away from us: for we are left a few among the nations, where thou hast scattered us.'

      v:004:
        - 'BAR:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Dead;</i> banished, (ver. 11., and Ezechiel xxxvii. 5.) or of the ancient patriarchs. This motive is frequently urged, Exodus xxxii. 13., Leviticus xxvi. 41., Deuteronomy ix. 27., Daniel iii. 35., and Jeremias xv. 1.

    commentary:
      v:000:
        - 'BAR:6:0 | 0 | Title | <i>A copy.</i> Septuagint place this after the Lamentations, which follow Baruch. (Haydock) --- Jeremias wrote it before the captives departed. Baruch read it to them at Babylon, and it was sent back to Jerusalem. (Worthington) --- It might be delivered to the captives at Reblatha. We have it not entire, as another circumstance respecting the ark is mentioned, 2 Machabees ii. 5. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'BAR:6:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Seven generations;</i> that is, seventy years. (Challoner) --- A generation sometimes consisted of seven, ten, fifteen, thirty, thirty-five, fifty, or a hundred years. (Cornelius a Lapide; Menage.) --- Eighteen years of the seventy had already elapsed. (Calmet) --- <i>Seven</i> is often put for many, (Haydock) or a general number, (Worthington) because so many days form a week. (Haydock) --- Grotius substitutes {GREEK:START dekadon}δηκαδον{GREEK:END} for {GREEK:START geneon}γηνηον{GREEK:END}, "seven decads," very properly. (Houbigant)'
      v:003:
        - 'BAR:6:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Shoulders.</i> This custom was very ancient, suggested by the avarice of the priests, who begged on such occasions. (Menander, ap. Clem. protrep.)'
      v:004:
        - BAR:6:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Fear.</i> Worship not such things. (Haydock)
      v:006:
        - 'BAR:6:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Angel</i> Michael, the conductor of Israel in the desert, &c., Daniel x. 13., and Exodus xxxiii. 2. (Calmet) --- He protected them also in Babylon. (Worthington)'
      v:008:
        - BAR:6:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Gay.</i> Nothing could be more despicable. (Calmet)
      v:010:
        - 'BAR:6:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>The harlots.</i> Their hire was rejected by the Lord. But idols suffered themselves to be despoiled or adorned at pleasure. Greek, "But they will give of them even to harlots under the <i>same</i> roof, while they adorn them (idols) like men with garments, gods of gold, silver, and wood." (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - "BAR:6:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Them,</i> on account of the many votaries, ver. 16. Arnobius (6) ridicules such gods. (Calmet) --- Protestants adopt similar arguments against the real presence as if we believed that Christ was hurt when the sacramental species were broken or devoured by vermin. A little more boldness will prompt them to reject the divinity of Christ, who was pleased to give up his body to those who treated him shamefully. Almost every argument which is levelled against Christ's real presence in the blessed Eucharist, may be turned against the incarnation; and hence so many now become Socinians, being unwilling to submit their understanding to the mysteries of religion. To apply these texts to holy pictures, would be nugatory. See Isaias xl 18. (Haydock) --- The absurdities here specified, shew how foolish are those who serve idols or take any images to be gods. (Worthington) --- Calvin represents the pagans as adoring God under the images, as if they used them in the same light as Catholics do; which is contrary to this epistle, &c. (Tirinus)"
      v:013:
        - 'BAR:6:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Judge,</i> or ruler. (Calmet) --- The sceptre and spear were badges of power. (Eustath.) --- Mars had a sword, Hercules a club. We know little of the idols of Babylon.'
      v:015:
        - 'BAR:6:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Vessel;</i> armour, or any utensil. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - 'BAR:6:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Candles.</i> Literally, "lamps." (Haydock) --- Some temples in Egypt were famous for their numbers. (Herodotus ii. 62.) --- The Lord prescribed them to be used. But who ever imagined that he stood in need of them to see, as the idolaters supposed their idols did?'
      v:019:
        - BAR:6:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Hearts:</i> the wood is worm-eaten. (Calmet)
      v:024:
        - 'BAR:6:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Price,</i> foolishly believing that they have divine power. (Worthington)'
      v:026:
        - 'BAR:6:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Gifts.</i> The Chaldeans supposed that Bel could eat, Daniel xiv. --- <i>Dead.</i> Food was placed on the tombs. St. Augustine abolished this custom in Africa.'
      v:027:
        - 'BAR:6:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Take.</i> Greek, "salt." They give none to the poor, for fear of their imposture being detected, though they allow even the unclean to eat, ver. 28., Leviticus xii. 2., and Deuteronomy xiv. 29.'
      v:029:
        - 'BAR:6:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Women.</i> They make gods. (Calmet) --- <i>Qui rogat, ille facit.</i> (Martial viii. 24.)'
      v:030:
        - 'BAR:6:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Shaven,</i> as in mourning, contrary to the custom of Israel, Leviticus xxi. 10. (Calmet) --- <i>Heads.</i> The Jewish priests wore mitres or caps.'
      v:031:
        - 'BAR:6:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Dead,</i> even of Adonis, (Haydock) whose worship is here ridiculed. (Calmet) --- At Biblos people bewailed his death, and the next day proclaimed that he was alive. All cut off their hair, as the Egyptians do for Apis, except such as submitted to prostitute themselves to strangers. The hire they consecrated to Venus. (Lucian, Dea Syra.) --- At funerals a feast was usually made, as is still the custom in Syria, (Roger, ii. 14.) and near Bagdad. (Chardin. ii. 7.)'
      v:034:
        - 'BAR:6:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Requite.</i> Greek, "brass," much less gold. (Haydock)'
      v:040:
        - 'BAR:6:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Chaldeans.</i> The priests themselves despise the idols most, (Calmet) and expose them to contempt, by pretending that they work miracles. (Haydock) --- "Those who first set up representations of the gods, deprived cities of reverential awe, and increased the error," said Varro; "prudently supposing that gods might easily be contemned, when like stupid images." <i>In simulacrorum stoliditate.</i> (St. Augustine, City of God iv. 26.)'
      v:041:
        - 'BAR:6:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>They.</i> Greek, "he could perceive. And they reflecting on this, cannot <i>still</i> abandon them; for they have no sense." (Haydock) --- They are so stupid, that they will not quit such impotent idols. (Calmet)'
      v:042:
        - 'BAR:6:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>Women.</i> Aristophanes calls harlots, "corded bodies." (Eccles. Act. i.) The women of Babylon "prostituted themselves once, in honour of Venus, (Haydock. Mylitta. Calmet) sitting with crowns on their heads in the temple, till some stranger selected them, and took them from their partition, made with cords," (Haydock) to some more secret place, where they broke their bands. (Herodotus i. 199.) (Calmet) --- That some deluded women, led by various <i>desires,</i> should think thus to honour that impure deity, by an action which some modern casuists have not scrupled to rank among simple <i>venial</i> sins, cannot excite our astonishment so much, when we reflect on the tenets of the ancient Gnostics, and of Antinomians at the present day, whom J. Wesley, the late founder of the Methodists, applauded and followed even in the meridian of the gospel light! See Deuteronomy xvi. 22., and xxiii. 17. Yet these men read and perhaps distributed the Bible! --- <i>Stones.</i> Literally, "bones;" (Haydock) or the refuse of what had been crushed, ({GREEK:START pitura}πιτυρα{GREEK:END}. Atheneus ii. 14.) to excite impure love. (Menochius) (Tirinus) --- Theocritus (Phar.) represents a witch doing the like; and Sanchez tells us, that some were taken in the fact in Spain. (Calmet) --- Fumigation, used by the Babylonians after marriage, (Herodotus i. 198.) may be insinuated. (Grotius)'
      v:045:
        - 'BAR:6:45 | 45 | 45 | <i>To be.</i> Isaias xliv. 14. Horace (i. Sat. 8) introduces Priapus thus ridiculously explaining his origin; "I was formerly an useless piece of a fig-tree; when the workman, not knowing whether to make a bench or a Priapus, chose rather that I should be a god. Hence I am a god, the greatest terror of thieves and birds." Septuagint, "they are nothing but what the workmen wish to form." (Haydock)'
      v:051:
        - 'BAR:6:51 | 51 | 51 | <i>Them.</i> Greek has simply, (Calmet) "Who then knows not that they are no gods?" (Haydock)'
      v:053:
        - BAR:6:53 | 53 | 53 | <i>Daws.</i> They have no greater influence (Calmet) than jackdaws.
      v:058:
        - 'BAR:6:58 | 58 | 58 | <i>Gods.</i> Septuagint repeat this after <i>satisfied,</i> or "will use;" and here add, "or a pillar of wood in palaces, than," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:059:
        - 'BAR:6:59 | 59 | 59 | <i>Obedient</i> to God. They were appointed to mark out the seasons, &c., (Genesis i. 14.) and if any creature were worthy of adoration, they would. (Calmet) --- The Babylonians adored them as well as statues, and therefore their proper destination is specified here and by Moses.'
      v:069:
        - 'BAR:6:69 | 69 | 69 | <i>Scarecrow.</i> Priapus answered this glorious purpose, ver. 45. (Haydock) --- When birds become accustomed to such things, they mind them not. (Calmet)'
      v:071:
        - 'BAR:6:71 | 71 | 71 | <i>Scarlet.</i> Greek, "marble" coloured wood. Grotius would substitute {GREEK:START margarou}μαργαρου{GREEK:END}, "a pearl," which decays through age. (Calmet) --- Greek also, "From the purple, which also shines upon them rotting, you shall," &c. {GREEK:START Marmarou}Μαρμαρου{GREEK:END} means, "of marble or shining."'
      v:072:
        - 'BAR:6:72 | 72 | 72 | <i>Reproach,</i> provided he also avoid the idols of the mind and of the heart. (Haydock)'

      v:003: 'BAR:6:3 | 3 | 3 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}But now, you shall see in Babylon gods of gold, and of silver, and of stone, and of wood, borne upon shoulders, causing fear to the Gentiles.'

      v:007: 'BAR:6:7 | 7 | 7 | For their tongue that is polished by the craftsman, and themselves laid over with gold and silver, are false things, and they cannot speak.'
      v:008: 'BAR:6:8 | 8 | 8 | And as if it were for a maiden that loveth to go gay: so do they take gold and make them up.'
      v:009: 'BAR:6:9 | 9 | 9 | Their gods have golden crowns upon their heads: whereof the priests secretly convey away from them gold, and silver, and bestow it on themselves.'

      v:014: 'BAR:6:14 | 14 | 14 | And this hath in his hand a sword, or an axe, but cannot save himself from war, or from robbers, whereby be it known to you, that they are not gods.'
      v:015: 'BAR:6:15 | 15 | 15 | Therefore, fear them not. For as a vessel that a man uses when it is broken becometh useless, even so are their gods:'
      v:016: 'BAR:6:16 | 16 | 16 | When they are placed in the house, their eyes are full of dust by the feet of them that go in.'
      v:017: 'BAR:6:17 | 17 | 17 | And as the gates are made sure on every side upon one that hath offended the king, or like a dead man carried to the grave, so do the priests secure the doors with bars and locks, lest they be stripped by thieves.'
      v:018: 'BAR:6:18 | 18 | 18 | They light candles to them, and in great number, of which they cannot see one: but they are like beams in the house.'

      v:025: 'BAR:6:25 | 25 | 25 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And having not the use of feet, they are carried upon shoulders, declaring to men how vile they are. Be they confounded also that worship them.'
      v:026: 'BAR:6:26 | 26 | 26 | Therefore if they fall to the ground, they rise not up again of themselves, nor if a man set them upright, will they stand by themselves, but their gifts shall be set before them, as to the dead.'
      v:027: 'BAR:6:27 | 27 | 27 | The things that are sacrificed to them, their priests sell and abuse: in like manner also their wives take part of them, but give nothing of it either to the sick, or to the poor.'
      v:028: 'BAR:6:28 | 28 | 28 | The child-bearing and menstruous women touch their sacrifices: knowing, therefore, by these things that they are not gods, fear them not.'
      v:029: 'BAR:6:29 | 29 | 29 | For how can they be called gods? because women set offerings before the gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood:'

      v:034: 'BAR:6:34 | 34 | 34 | In like manner they can neither give riches, nor requite evil. If a man make a vow to them, and perform it not: they cannot require it.'

      v:040: 'BAR:6:40 | 40 | 40 | Even the Chaldeans themselves dishonour them: who when they hear of one dumb that cannot speak, they present him to Bel, entreating him, that he may speak,'

      v:043: 'BAR:6:43 | 43 | 43 | And when any one of them, drawn away by some passenger, lieth with him, she upbraideth her neighbour, that she was not thought as worthy as herself, nor her cord broken.'
      v:044: 'BAR:6:44 | 44 | 44 | But all things that are done about them, are false: how is it then to be thought, or to be said, that they are gods?'
      v:045: 'BAR:6:45 | 45 | 45 | And they are made by workmen, and by goldsmiths. They shall be nothing else but what the priests will have them to be.'
      v:046: 'BAR:6:46 | 46 | 46 | For the artificers themselves that make them, are of no long continuance. Can those things then that are made by them, be gods?'
      v:047: BAR:6:47 | 47 | 47 | But they have left false things and reproach to them that come after.
      v:048: 'BAR:6:48 | 48 | 48 | For when war cometh upon them, or evils: the priests consult with themselves, where they may hide themselves with them.'
      v:049: 'BAR:6:49 | 49 | 49 | How then can they be thought to be gods, that can neither deliver themselves from war, nor save themselves from evils?'
      v:050: "BAR:6:50 | 50 | 50 | For seeing they are but of wood, and laid over with gold, and with silver, it shall be known hereafter that they are false things, by all nations and kings: and it shall be manifest that they are no gods, but the work of men's hands, and that there is no work of God in them."
      v:051: "BAR:6:51 | 51 | 51 | Whence, therefore, is it known that they are not gods, but the work of men's hands, and no work of God is in them?"
      v:052: 'BAR:6:52 | 52 | 52 | They cannot set up a king over the land, nor give rain to men.'
      v:053: 'BAR:6:53 | 53 | 53 | They determine no causes, nor deliver countries from oppression: because they can do nothing, and are as daws between heaven and earth.'
      v:054: 'BAR:6:54 | 54 | 54 | For when fire shall fall upon the house of <i>these</i> gods of wood, and of silver, and of gold, their priests indeed will flee away, and be saved: but they themselves shall be burnt in the midst like beams.'
      v:055: 'BAR:6:55 | 55 | 55 | And they cannot withstand a king and war. How then can it be supposed, or admitted, that they are gods?'
      v:056: 'BAR:6:56 | 56 | 56 | Neither are these gods of wood, and of stone, and laid over with gold, and with silver, able to deliver themselves from thieves or robbers: they that are stronger than them,'
      v:057: 'BAR:6:57 | 57 | 57 | Shall take from them the gold, and silver, and the raiment wherewith they are clothed, and shall go their way, neither shall they help themselves.'
      v:058: 'BAR:6:58 | 58 | 58 | Therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth his power: or else a profitable vessel in the house, with which the owner thereof will be well satisfied: or a door in the house, to keep things safe that are therein, than such false gods.'
      v:059: 'BAR:6:59 | 59 | 59 | The sun, and the moon, and the stars being bright, and sent forth for profitable uses, are obedient.'
      v:060: 'BAR:6:60 | 60 | 60 | In like manner the lightning, when it breaketh forth, is easy to be seen: and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every country.'
      v:061: 'BAR:6:61 | 61 | 61 | And the clouds, when God commandeth them to go over the whole world, do that which is commanded them.'
      v:062: 'BAR:6:62 | 62 | 62 | The fire also being sent from above to consume mountains, and woods, doth as it is commanded. But these neither in shew, nor in power, are alike to any one of them.'
      v:063: 'BAR:6:63 | 63 | 63 | Wherefore it is neither to be thought, nor to be said, that they are gods: since they are neither able to judge causes, nor to do any good to men.'
      v:064: 'BAR:6:64 | 64 | 64 | Knowing, therefore, that they are not gods, fear them not.'
      v:065: 'BAR:6:65 | 65 | 65 | For neither can they curse kings, nor bless them.'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - '<b>Baruch</b> was a man of noble extraction, and learned in the law, secretary and disciple to the prophet Jeremias, and a sharer in his labours and persecutions; which is the reason why the ancient Fathers have considered this book as a part of the prophecy of Jeremias, and have usually quoted it under his name. (Challoner) --- The frequent Hebrew idioms shew it to have been originally in that language. Baruch wrote by inspiration of the Holy Ghost the letter comprising the five first chapters, which he carried to the Jews from their brethren at Babylon. The martyrologies place his death, December 28. The sixth chapter contains a letter of Jeremias, to which allusion is clearly made [in] 2 Machabees ii. 2. The Church still recites the works of Baruch under the name of Jeremias. (Sab. Pent. proph. 6.) (Calmet) --- Many Fathers did so formerly, though they doubted not but Baruch was the author. See St. Irenæus, [Against Heresies] v. 35.; St. Augustine, City of God xviii. 33., &c. Others, with Origen (Prin. ii. 3.) specify the writer; and the Councils of Laodicea, Florence, and Trent, decide that it is canonical. St. Jerome alleged it not against the Jews, as they denied its authority. (Worthington) --- See Jeremias xxxii. 44. (Haydock) --- In his preface on Jeremias he testifies that "it contains many things relating to Christ and the latter times." (Worthington) --- Grotius in vain attempts to represent some parts as interpolated (chap. iii. 38., &c.; Calmet) and L. Cappellus has left some posthumous notes, which would represent the author as a stupid impostor, though he acknowledges his great learning. (Houbigant)'
