    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1KI:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Years;</i> sixty-nine, as he died when he was seventy years old. (Calmet) (2 Kings v. 4.) --- <i>Warm.</i> Though David was of a strong constitution, he had been so much exposed to fatigue, and so harassed with domestic broils, that his vigour was nearly decayed. (Calmet) --- The Rabbins say, that the sight of the angel had greatly contributed to weaken him. Lyranus, and others, suppose that he was affected with the palsy. (Abulensis; Salien, the year of the world 3019.)'
      v:002:
        - '1KI:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Servants.</i> Physicians. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] vii. 14.) --- People of the faculty still adopt the same sentiments; and when fire and clothes will not procure heat, they advise the application of living creatures. (Bartholin ix.; Galen vii.; Vales. Philos. c. 19.)'
      v:003:
        - '1KI:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Sunamitess.</i> Sunam was not far from Thabor, in the tribe of Issachar. (Calmet) --- This history leads us to explain the ambition and death of Adonias. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - "1KI:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Her.</i> Which shews the virtue and temperance of David. (Menochius) --- She was his wife, at least of a secondary order. Adonias flattered himself, on account of Abisag's virginity, that the law did not hinder him from marrying her; (Leviticus xviii. 8.; Kimchi) or he was blinded by ambition. (Calmet) --- Heretics and persecutors thus attempt in vain, (Haydock) to defile the Church, the chaste spouse of Jesus, that they may usurp his throne. (Calmet)"
      v:005:
        - '1KI:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Him.</i> He was not deterred by the fate of Absalom. (Haydock) --- He was now the eldest son, and gave himself out for the presumptive heir. (Calmet) --- David is blamed for some remissness, in not repressing him; (Salien) as his conduct tended to excite confusion, and to frustrate the appointment of God. But the king was convinced that nothing would be able to disturb that order; and he would take measures, in due time, to curb the ambition of his eldest son, from which, as yet, he apprehended no danger. (Haydock) --- Old age renders people slow. (Menochius)'
      v:007:
        - '1KI:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Side.</i> For their own interest, and because they supposed that the throne belonged of course to him. (Menochius) --- This was the natural privilege, when no other disposition was made by God, or by the kings who succeeded David. They did not esteem themselves bound to leave the crown to their eldest sons. Hitherto God had made choice himself, as he had required, Deuteronomy xvii. 15. In favour of David, he pleased to grant sovereignty to his descendants. But the king expected to declare which he preferred, in case he chose to deviate from the natural order, ver. 20.'
      v:008:
        - "1KI:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Sadoc,</i> the rival of Abiathar, and a descendant of Eleazar. David had permitted both to perform the functions of the high priesthood; (Calmet) or one had acted as the delegate of the other. (Salien) --- <i>Banaias</i> was distinguished for his valour, 2 Kings xxiii. 20. He was in the flower of his age, and, perhaps, aspired at the authority of Joab, whose credit began to decline; as he was grown old, and was known to be rather disagreeable to David, and had been guilty of such horrid murders. Both the contending princes sought to ingratiate themselves with the army and with the priests, as their influence was of the utmost consequence. Solomon was more fortunate, in having also <i>Nathan the prophet</i> on his side; but the throne was secured to him much more on account of the divine decree, 2 Kings vii. 12., and xii. 25. (Haydock) --- Nathan is commonly considered as the tutor of the young prince, (Menochius) and was styled his \"father.\" (Calmet) --- <i>Semei,</i> or Nabath, father of Jeroboam; and <i>Rei,</i> or Ira, who is styled the <i>priest</i> of David, 2 Kings xx. 26. (St. Jerome, Tradit.) (Menochius) --- To confound Semei with Nabath is wrong. (Salien) --- <i>Army;</i> the king's guard consisting chiefly of the Cerethi, &c., (Calmet) who were under Banaias. The whole army, over which Joab was general, was not always in arms. Septuagint, \"Semei and Resi, other copies read (Haydock) his friends,\" (with Syriac; Arabic) \"and Daia, heroes of David.\" Hebrew may be, \"neither the hearers nor the seers, nor the brave men of David were with Adonias.\" The populace, or the disciples, as well as the prophets, may be thus denoted."
      v:009:
        - '1KI:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Slain.</i> Either for sacrifice, or simply for a feast; (Calmet) though it is probable that victims of peace would be offered, as on similar occasions, on which the guests would afterwards feast, 1 Kings xi. (Haydock) --- <i>Rogel,</i> east of Jerusalem, in the vale of Josaphat. (Menochius)'
      v:010:
        - '1KI:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Not.</i> Out of contempt, (Calmet) and because he knew that they would oppose his measures. (Haydock)\'
      v:011:
        - 1KI:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>It not.</i> So that we may safely endeavour to overturn his plans. (Menochius)
      v:012:
        - '1KI:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Life.</i> Both would have been in imminent danger, if the ambitious projects of Adonias succeeded, as he knew that the throne had been promised to Solomon by his father, and he would consider him as a dangerous rival. (Calmet) --- The Turkish emperors usually destroy or confine their brethren, when they commence their reign. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - '1KI:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Swear.</i> This he did, either when he <i>comforted</i> her, after the death of her first-born; (2 Kings xii. 24.) or rather, when Solomon had received so glorious a name, and was declared the heir by Nathan, 2 Kings vii. 12., and 1 Paralipomenon xxii. 20., and xxviii. 5. Adonias acknowledges that God had made choice of his brother, chap. ii. 15. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - "1KI:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Words,</i> and confirm what thou hast said, (Menochius) reminding the king of God's express declaration. (Haydock)"
      v:016:
        - '1KI:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Worshipped.</i> Protestants, "did obeisance." Hebrew, "fell prostrate on the ground before the king," (Calmet) without any danger of idolatry. (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - 1KI:1:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Of it.</i> So that thy authority is also contemned. (Menochius)
      v:020:
        - '1KI:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Thee.</i>  Adonias boasts that all Israel was on his side, chap. ii. 15.  (Calmet) --- But, in reality, the people waited for the final decision of David.  (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - '1KI:1:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Offenders.</i> I, as guilty of adultery; and my son, as a mamzer; (Deuteronomy xxiii. 2.; Tirinus) or we shall be accounted pretenders, (Haydock) and condemned as guilty of high treason. (Calmet) --- Our hopes and expectations will be frustrated. (Vatable) (Estius) --- We shall be despised or punished. (Worthington)'
      v:028:
        - '1KI:1:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Come in.</i> Nathan went out, at the same time; (Menochius) so that each had a private audience. (Calmet)'
      v:033:
        - '1KI:1:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Lord,</i> David. (Menochius) --- The Cerethi, and other life-guards, went under the command of their captain, Banaias, (Calmet) to repel any force that might disturb this solemn inauguration. (Haydock) --- <i>Mule.</i> None but the king was allowed to mount it. --- <i>Gihon,</i> a fountain, or place of public resort, on the west of Jerusalem. Ezechias brought its waters into the city, 2 Paralipomenon xxxii. 30. (Calmet) --- Adonias was at Rogel, on the east. (Menochius)'
      v:034:
        - '1KI:1:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Save,</i> (<i>Vivat.</i>) "Live." May Solomon reign for many years. (Haydock)'
      v:035:
        - '1KI:1:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Stead.</i> Not after me only. David voluntarily abdicates the throne, so that Solomon reigned in his life-time. (Menochius)'
      v:036:
        - '1KI:1:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>King.</i> May all have a prosperous issue, conformably to the wishes of your majesty and the decrees of God. (Calmet)'
      v:037:
        - '1KI:1:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>David.</i> Parents wish their children to be still more happy than themselves, how jealous soever they may be of their own glory. (Calmet){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Aspice completum votum; jam natus adæquat</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Te meritis, &, quod magis est optabile, vincit.</i> (Claud. iv. Con. Honor.)'
      v:039:
        - '1KI:1:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Horn of oil.</i> Such liquors were commonly kept in vessels of horn. (Calmet) --- Some say that oil, for the consecration of priests, was used on this occasion; and that the ceremony was performed only, when the throne was contested: as in the case of Joas, Joachaz, &c. (Haydock) --- Nathan assisted Sadoc, (ver. 34,) who was not yet the high priest. (Menochius)'
      v:040:
        - '1KI:1:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Rang.</i> Hebrew, "was split." Chaldean, "shook." (Menochius)'
      v:041:
        - 1KI:1:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Uproar.</i> Nathan had conducted the affair with singular address. A little delay might have plunged the kingdom into all the horrors of a civil war.
      v:043:
        - '1KI:1:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Not so.</i> Hebrew, "Misfortune or mourning, or verily." A man of character did not willingly deliver a disagreeable message, 2 Kings xviii. 25. (Calmet) --- But Jonathan was concerned for his father. (Haydock)'
      v:047:
        - '1KI:1:47 | 47 | 47 | <i>Blessed.</i> Congratulating him on the exaltation of Solomon. --- <i>Bed.</i> Shewing respect to the new king, as Jacob had done to Joseph; (Genesis xlvii. 31.; Sanctius) or laying himself down again; (Calmet) or rather giving thanks to God, (Menochius) whom he adored, in gratitude for the favour of a successor being granted to him. (Worthington)'
      v:049:
        - '1KI:1:49 | 49 | 49 | <i>Afraid.</i> As they had offended both David and Solomon, and had rendered themselves suspected of high treason.'
      v:051:
        - '1KI:1:51 | 51 | 51 | <i>Altar.</i> At Gabaon, (2 Paralipomenon i. 3.) or at Sion. All nations seemed to grant the right of an asylum to sacred places; but only in favour of the innocent, Exodus xxi. 14. (Calmet)'
      v:053:
        - '1KI:1:53 | 53 | 53 | <i>House.</i> He does not forbid him the court, but grants him pardon. (Menochius)'

    verses:
      v:001: '1KI:1:1 | 1 | 1 | Now {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}king David was old, and advanced in years: and when he was covered with clothes, he was not warm.'
      v:002: '1KI:1:2 | 2 | 2 | His servants, therefore, said to him: Let us seek for our Lord the king, a young virgin, and let her stand before the king, and cherish him, and sleep in his bosom, and warm our lord the king.'
      v:003: '1KI:1:3 | 3 | 3 | So they sought a beautiful young woma,n in all the coasts of Israel, and they found Abisag, a Sunamitess, and brought her to the king.'
      v:004: '1KI:1:4 | 4 | 4 | And the damsel was exceedingly beautiful, and she slept with the king, and served him, but the king did not know her.'
      v:005: '1KI:1:5 | 5 | 5 | And Adonias, the son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying: I will be king. And he made himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.'
      v:006: '1KI:1:6 | 6 | 6 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Neither did his father rebuke him at any time, saying: Why hast thou done this? And he also was very beautiful, the next in birth after Absalom.'
      v:007: "1KI:1:7 | 7 | 7 | And he conferred with Joab, the son of Sarvia, and with Abiathar, the priest, who furthered Adonias's side."
      v:008: "1KI:1:8 | 8 | 8 | But Sadoc, the priest, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and Nathan, the prophet, and Semei, and Rei, and the strength of David's army, was not with Adonias."
      v:009: "1KI:1:9 | 9 | 9 | And Adonias having slain rams and calves, and all fat cattle, by the stone of Zoheleth, which was near the fountain Rogel, invited all his brethren, the king's sons, and all the men of Juda, the king's servants:"
      v:010: '1KI:1:10 | 10 | 10 | But Nathan, the prophet, and Banaias, and all the valiant men, and Solomon, his brother, he invited not.'
      v:011: '1KI:1:11 | 11 | 11 | And Nathan said to Bethsabee, the mother of Solomon: Hast thou not heard that Adonias, the son of Haggith, reigneth, and our lord David knoweth it not?'
      v:012: '1KI:1:12 | 12 | 12 | Now then, come, take my counsel, and save thy life, and the life of thy son Solomon.'
      v:013: '1KI:1:13 | 13 | 13 | Go, and get thee in to king David, and say to him: Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear to me, thy handmaid, saying: Solomon, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? why then doth Adonias reign?'
      v:014: '1KI:1:14 | 14 | 14 | And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I will come in after thee, and will fill up thy words.'
      v:015: '1KI:1:15 | 15 | 15 | So Bethsabee went in to the king into the chamber. Now the king was very old, and Abisag, the Sunamitess, ministered to him.'
      v:016: '1KI:1:16 | 16 | 16 | Bethsabee bowed herself, and worshipped the king. And the king said to her: What is thy will?'

      v:020: '1KI:1:20 | 20 | 20 | And now, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldst tell them, who shall sit on thy throne, my lord the king, after thee.'
      v:021: '1KI:1:21 | 21 | 21 | Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king sleepeth with his fathers, that I, and my son, Solomon, shall be accounted offenders.'
      v:022: '1KI:1:22 | 22 | 22 | As she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan, the prophet, came.'
      v:023: '1KI:1:23 | 23 | 23 | And they told the king, saying: Nathan, the prophet, is here. And when he was come in before the king, and had worshipped, bowing down to the ground,'
      v:024: '1KI:1:24 | 24 | 24 | Nathan said: My lord, O king, hast thou said: Let Adonias reign after me, and let him sit upon my throne?'
      v:025: "1KI:1:25 | 25 | 25 | Because he is gone down to-day, and hath killed oxen, and fatlings, and many rams, and invited all the king's sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar, the priest: and they are eating and drinking before him, and saying: God save king Adonias:"
      v:026: '1KI:1:26 | 26 | 26 | But me, thy servant, and Sadoc, the priest, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and Solomon, thy servant, he hath not invited.'
      v:027: '1KI:1:27 | 27 | 27 | Is this word come out from my lord the king, and hast thou not told me, thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?'
      v:028: '1KI:1:28 | 28 | 28 | And king David answered, and said: Call to me Bethsabee. And when she was come in to the king, and stood before him,'
      v:029: '1KI:1:29 | 29 | 29 | The king swore, and said: As the Lord liveth, who hath delivered my soul out of all distress,'
      v:030: '1KI:1:30 | 30 | 30 | Even as I swore to thee, by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: Solomon thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead, so will I do this day.'
      v:031: '1KI:1:31 | 31 | 31 | And Bethsabee, bowing with her face to the earth, worshipped the king, saying: May my lord David live for ever.'
      v:032: '1KI:1:32 | 32 | 32 | King David also said: Call me Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Banaias, the son of Joiada. And when they were come in before the king,'
      v:033: '1KI:1:33 | 33 | 33 | He said to them: Take with you the servants of your lord, and set my son Solomon upon my mule: and bring him to Gihon:'
      v:034: '1KI:1:34 | 34 | 34 | And let Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, anoint him there king over Israel: and you shall sound the trumpet, and shall say: God save king Solomon.'
      v:035: '1KI:1:35 | 35 | 35 | And you shall come up after him, and he shall come, and shall sit upon my throne, and he shall reign in my stead: and I will appoint him to be ruler over Israel, and over Juda.'
      v:036: '1KI:1:36 | 36 | 36 | And Banaias, the son of Joiada, answered the king, saying: Amen: so say the Lord, the God of my lord the king.'
      v:037: '1KI:1:37 | 37 | 37 | As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, so be he with Solomon, and make his throne higher than the throne of my lord king David.'
      v:038: '1KI:1:38 | 38 | 38 | So Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, went down, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and Phelethi: and they set Solomon upon the mule of king David, and brought him to Gihon.'
      v:039: '1KI:1:39 | 39 | 39 | And Sadoc, the priest, took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon: and they sounded the trumpet, and all the people said: God save king Solomon.'
      v:040: '1KI:1:40 | 40 | 40 | And all the multitude went up after him, and the people played with pipes, and rejoiced with a great joy, and the earth rang with the noise of their cry.'
      v:041: '1KI:1:41 | 41 | 41 | And Adonias, and all that were invited by him, heard it, and now the feast was at an end. Joab also, hearing the sound of the trumpet, said: What meaneth this noise of the city in an uproar?'
      v:042: '1KI:1:42 | 42 | 42 | While he yet spoke, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar, the priest, came: and Adonias said to him: Come in, because thou art a valiant man, and bringest good news.'
      v:043: '1KI:1:43 | 43 | 43 | And Jonathan answered Adonias: Not so: for our lord, king David, hath appointed Solomon king;'
      v:044: "1KI:1:44 | 44 | 44 | And hath sent with him Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Banaias, the son of Joiada, and the Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and they have set him upon the king's mule:"
      v:045: '1KI:1:45 | 45 | 45 | And Sadoc, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, have anointed him king, in Gihon: and they are gone up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again: this is the noise that you have heard.'
      v:046: '1KI:1:46 | 46 | 46 | Moreover, Solomon sitteth upon the throne of the kingdom.'
      v:047: "1KI:1:47 | 47 | 47 | And the king's servants going in, have blessed our lord king David, saying: May God make the name of Solomon greater than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king adored in his bed:"
      v:048: '1KI:1:48 | 48 | 48 | And he said: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who hath given this day one to sit on my throne, my eyes seeing it.'
      v:049: '1KI:1:49 | 49 | 49 | Then all the guests of Adonias were afraid, and they all arose, and every man went his way.'
      v:050: '1KI:1:50 | 50 | 50 | And Adonias fearing Solomon, arose and went, and took hold of the horn of the altar.'
      v:051: '1KI:1:51 | 51 | 51 | And they told Solomon, saying: Behold Adonias, fearing king Solomon, hath taken hold of the horn of the altar, saying: Let king Solomon swear to me this day, that he will not kill his servant with the sword.'
      v:052: '1KI:1:52 | 52 | 52 | And Solomon said: If he be a good man, there shall not so much as one hair of his head fall to the ground: but if evil be found in him, he shall die.'
      v:053: '1KI:1:53 | 53 | 53 | Then king Solomon sent, and brought him out from the altar: and going in, he worshipped king Solomon: and Solomon said to him: Go to thy house.'

    commentary:
      v:002:
        - '1KI:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Flesh,</i> to the tomb. <i>Omnium idem exitus est, sed & idem domicilium.</i> (Petronius) ---In life each follows his own course. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - "1KI:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Charge,</i> what he orders. --- <i>Understand.</i> Hebrew, \"act prudently,\" (Menochius) or \"with success,\" Greek interpreters (Calmet) and Chaldean. (Menochius) --- The observance of God's law, both in private and in public, will ensure to thee the title of a wise prince."
      v:004:
        - '1KI:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Truth</i> and sincerity. (Calmet) --- This promise was made, 2 Kings vii. 16. (Menochius)'
      v:005:
        - '1KI:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Joab.</i> These instructions given by David to his son, with relation to Joab and Semei, proceeded not from any rancour of heart, or private pique; but from a zeal for justice: that crimes so public and heinous might not pass unpunished. (Challoner) --- David and Solomon esteemed themselves, in a manner, defiled, as long as these continued unpunished, ver. 31. Joab had behaved to David with great insolence, after the death of Absalom. (Haydock) --- He had lately sided with Adonias. (Menochius) --- But what touched the good old king more particularly, were the treacherous murders of two great generals, who had put themselves under his protection, and were endeavouring to promote his welfare. Only the fear of greater commotions had hitherto prevented David from bringing his nephew to public execution, as the people expected. He deemed it requisite to remind his successor of this obligation, when his power should be sufficiently strong, that the impunity of such daring offenders might not destroy the commonwealth. (Haydock) --- <i>Peace.</i> Pretending affection. Joab had treated Abner and Amasa as the worst of enemies, and their blood had stained his garments. (Menochius)'
      v:006:
        - '1KI:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>To hell.</i> This word <i>hell</i> doth not signify the place or state of damnation; but the place and state of the dead. (Challoner) --- It would have been a great scandal if this murderer had died quietly in his old age. Joab had rendered great services to his uncle, for which he had been rewarded. He had been at the head of the armies 40 years. His great age rendered him now less formidable; particularly as the nation enjoyed peace.'

        - '1KI:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>David.</i> Thus died this perfect model of princes, and this great saint, whose only fault, of consequence, was occasioned by Bethsabee: (2 Kings xi. 4.) and this served to display his repentance. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxxvii.) --- He prefigured Jesus Christ in a wonderful manner; in his birth, at the same city; his election, in preference to his brethren; his persecutions, and subsequent glory. Jesus was, in like manner, betrayed by a false friend, and obliged to go out of Jerusalem, laden with his cross. But he acquired fresh splendour by his sufferings, and purchased a more faithful people. The tomb of David remained for many ages, Acts ii. 29. Josephus says that it contained vast riches: but this seems to be fabulous. St. Jerome often went to pray at this tomb. (Ep. ad Marcel.) --- If it be now unknown, the Holy Ghost has left us a more illustrious monument to the honour of this great man, in the Psalms, and Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 2., &c. (Calmet) --- We have now only an abridgment of his history, 1 Paralipomenon xxix. 29.'

        - '1KI:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Wife.</i> Some think that Joab had instigated Adonias to make this petition, that his party might be strengthened. (Theodoret, q. 7.) But love might be his prompter. (Calmet) --- Bethsabee consented to further his petition, (Menochius) without suspecting any bad consequences. (Haydock)'

(Grotius) --- Hence Adonias might be suspected of ambitious projects, as his party was still formidable. (Calmet) --- The marriage seems also to be unlawful. (Menochius) See chap. i. 4. --- Yet, if the aforesaid custom subsisted at that time; or, if the marriage had been evidently prohibited, both Adonias and Bethsabee must have acted in a very inconsistent manner, so that we must hesitate before we pronounce sentence. (Haydock) --- Many condemn Solomon of precipitation and cruelty in his judgment; (Cajetan) while others approve of his conduct, (Theodoret, q. 7,) and think any delay might have proved dangerous. <i>Ubi facto magis quam consulto opus.</i> (Tacitus) (Calmet)'

(Calmet) --- He might have justly put him to death, if he had committed a crime worthy of it; as his dignity did not give him a right to disturb the peace of the state with impunity. (Haydock) --- Solomon acted as a prophet. (Worthington) --- God had long before denounced that the family of Eleazar should regain the dignity, which Heli had obtained by some means or other, 1 Kings ii. 31. (Haydock) --- Solomon only put the divine decree in execution. (Pineda vi. 15.) --- Sadoc had perhaps also passed sentence, as the Levitical tribe had a great sway in the courts of judicature. (Menochius) --- Abiathar was still honoured with his former title, chap. iv. 4. But he was not permitted to officiate, (Calmet) nor to remain in the royal city, as he seemed now to be a dangerous man. (Haydock) --- Anathoth was a sacerdotal town in Benjamin. (Menochius) --- A portion of the suburbs had been assigned to Abiathar, unless he had obtained a field by inheritance, or by marrying an heiress, See Jeremias xxxii. 7. (Calmet)'

        - '1KI:2:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Slew him,</i> holding the altar; though some think that he was removed by force, like Athalia, 4 Kings xi. 15.

      v:004: '1KI:2:4 | 4 | 4 | That the Lord may confirm his words, which he hath spoken of me, saying: If thy children shall take heed to their ways, and shall walk before me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, there shall not be taken away from thee a man on the throne of Israel.'
      v:005: '1KI:2:5 | 5 | 5 | Thou knowest also what Joab, the son of Sarvia, hath done to me, what he did to the two captains of the army of Israel, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}to Abner, the son of Ner, and to Amasa, the son of Jether: whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war on his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.'

      v:022: '1KI:2:22 | 22 | 22 | And king Solomon answered, and said to his mother: Why dost thou ask Abisag, the Sunamitess, for Adonias? ask for him also the kingdom; for he is my elder brother, and hath Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the son of Sarvia.'
      v:023: '1KI:2:23 | 23 | 23 | Then king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying: So and so may God do to me, and add more, if Adonias hath not spoken this word against his own life.'

      v:027: '1KI:2:27 | 27 | 27 | So Solomon cast out Abiathar, from being the priest of the Lord, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Heli in Silo.'
      v:028: '1KI:2:28 | 28 | 28 | And the news came to Joab, because Joab had turned after Adonias, and had not turned after Solomon: and Joab fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and took hold on the horn of the altar.'
      v:029: '1KI:2:29 | 29 | 29 | And it was told king Solomon, that Joab was fled into the tabernacle of the Lord, and was by the altar: and Solomon sent Banaias, the son of Joiada, saying: Go, kill him.'

      v:031: '1KI:2:31 | 31 | 31 | And the king said to him: Do as he hath said; and kill him, and bury him, and thou shalt remove the innocent blood which hath been shed by Joab, from me, and from the house of my father:'
      v:032: '1KI:2:32 | 32 | 32 | And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head; because he murdered two men, just and better than himself: and slew them with the sword, my father, David, not knowing it; {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Abner, the son of Ner, general of the army of Israel, and Amasa, the son of Jether, general of the army of Juda;'
      v:033: '1KI:2:33 | 33 | 33 | And their blood shall return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever. But to David and his seed, and his house, and to his throne, be peace for ever from the Lord.'
      v:034: '1KI:2:34 | 34 | 34 | So Banaias, the son of Joiada, went up, and setting upon him slew him, and he was buried in his house in the desert.'
      v:035: '1KI:2:35 | 35 | 35 | And the king appointed Banaias, the son of Joiada in his room over the army; and Sadoc, the priest, he put in the place of Abiathar.'
      v:036: '1KI:2:36 | 36 | 36 | The king also sent, and called for Semei, and said to him: Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there: and go not out from thence any where.'

      v:038: '1KI:2:38 | 38 | 38 | And Semei said to the king: The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Semei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.'
      v:039: '1KI:2:39 | 39 | 39 | And it came to pass after three years, that the servants of Semei ran away to Achis, the son of Maacha, the king of Geth: and it was told Semei that his servants were gone to Geth.'
      v:040: '1KI:2:40 | 40 | 40 | And Semei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Achis, to Geth, to seek his servants, and he brought them out of Geth.'
      v:041: '1KI:2:41 | 41 | 41 | And it was told Solomon, that Semei had gone from Jerusalem to Geth, and was come back.'
      v:042: '1KI:2:42 | 42 | 42 | And sending he called for him, and said to him: Did I not protest to thee by the Lord, and tell thee before: On what day soever thou shalt go out and walk abroad any where, know that thou shalt die? And thou answeredst me: The word that I have heard is good.'
      v:043: '1KI:2:43 | 43 | 43 | Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment that I laid upon thee?'

        - '1KI:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Solomon.</i> By the death of his enemies, and by his affinity with the king of Egypt, and his friendship with Hiram, king Tyre, who were the most potent princes in the neighbourhood. Eupolemus (ap. Eusebius, præp.) has a letter of Solomon to Pharao Vaphres, in which the latter is said to have been the friend of David; (Salien) and St. Clement of Alexandria (Strom. i.) produces the testimony of Polyhistor, saying, that Vaphres sent 80,000 Egyptian workmen to assist Solomon to build the temple. --- <i>Daughter.</i> Who, probably, embraced the true religion; so that her praises are supposed to be recorded in the 44th Psalm, and in the canticles; though it seems she afterwards relapsed, and became the chief instrument in the perversion of the king, chap. xi. 1. --- <i>David.</i> She dwelt in the apartments of Bethsabee, (Canticle of Canticles iii. 4., and viii. 2,) till a magnificent palace could be built for her reception, chap. vii. 8. To marry idolatrous women was strictly forbidden, Deuteronomy vii. 3., 1 Esdras x. 2., and 2 Esdras xiii. 26.'

Hebrew, "for the rest, (Calmet) <i>or</i> only;" (as also ver. 3,) which may signify that the people, and their king, were blamable; or else, that they zealously offered sacrifices to God, even before the temple was erected. (Haydock) --- Those who afterwards left that sacred place, to imitate the conduct of idolaters, or of the ancient patriarchs, which was no longer tolerated, are justly condemned. (Calmet) --- <i>High places.</i> That is, altars where they worshipped the Lord, indeed, but not according to the ordinance of the law; which allowed of no other places for sacrifice but the temple of God. Among these high places, that of Gabaon was the chief, because there was the tabernacle of the testimony which had been removed from Silo to Nobe, and from Nobe to Gabaon. (Challoner) --- Hither David would have gone, as Solomon did, ver. 4. (Calmet) --- Hence this was not, at least, once of those high places, where it was unlawful to offer sacrifice; as the tabernacle was there, and the altar of holocausts, which Moses had erected. The obligation of sacrificing in no place, except in that which the Lord had appointed, regarded the times while the ark was in the desert, (Haydock) and when it was placed in the temple. While it continued in an unsettled state, people enjoyed more liberty in this respect; (Calmet) particularly when there was a prophet present, to sanction what they did. (Haydock)'

Thus one verse explains the other. There were, indeed, no <i>kingdoms</i> (Calmet) in this portion of land, which is now quite barren: but formerly it had several cities, and they belonged to various kings of Egypt, Arabia, the Philistines, &c. (Haydock) --- Hebrew may be rendered \"from the river, (Euphrates) the land of the Philistines, and to the border,\" &c., (Calmet) agreeably to 2 Paralipomenon ix. 26. <i>He exercised authority over all the kings from the river Euphrates to the land,</i> &c.

        - "1KI:4:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Forty:</i> 2 Paralipomenon ix. 25., has <i>four</i> in the Hebrew. Septuagint read in both places 40,000 mares, for chariots, and 12,000 horses. (Calmet) --- The Alexandrian copy has 40 here, and 4000 in the latter place; where, instead of horses, it gives horsemen, with the Vulgate. These two words are often used as synonymous by the best authors. But it is more difficult to reconcile the number; (Calmet) as (2 Paralipomenon xiv.) we read again differently, <i>he had</i> 1400 <i>chariots, and</i> 12,000 <i>horsemen.</i> (Haydock) --- <i>Forty</i> might easily be mistaken for <i>four,</i> by only adding <i>im</i> at the end of <i>arba.</i> (Bochart) (Grotius) --- Instead of stalls, Calmet supposes stables to be understood, and in each he would place ten horses, which completes the number here assigned. If this be admitted, no change is necessary: but, as <i>præsepe</i> signifies \"a stall,\" we may adhere to the Vulgate, which has 40,000 in both places; whereas the Hebrew varies, though the sense may be the same. The number of Solomon's chariots was 1400. As two horses were usually employed to draw them, 2800; or, allowing for accidents, changes, &c., 4000 horses would have been amply sufficient. It seems, therefore, that we should admit only so many horses or stalls. (Haydock) --- \"Vignoles conjectures, that the Jews formerly used marks analogous to our common figures; as the Arabians have done for many hundred years. And, if so, the corruption\" of hundreds for tens, &c., \"may be easily accounted for, by the transcriber's carelessly adding or omitting a single <i>cypher.</i>\" (Kennicott, Diss. ii.) --- Yet, if 40,000 horses must be admitted, we may say that they were not all intended for the chariots of war, but some for draught-horses, to convey the stones and other materials for the numerous buildings, which Solomon carried on. This might serve to excuse him for having so many horses, (Haydock) contrary to the letter of the law, and the example of Josue and of David. His subjects were thus, perhaps, engaged in too much commerce with the Egyptians: and the king was forced to burden them with taxes, which at last proved so fatal. (Serarius) (Pineda) (Calmet) --- Yet some undertake his defence, by saying that he did not act against the spirit of the law; that many of the horses were imposed as a tribute, and Solomon did not place his trust in them, Proverbs xxi. 31., and 2 Paralipomenon ix. 24. (Tostat) (Bochart, B. ii. 9.) --- His empire was become more extensive, and his works more splendid; so that what might appear an useless parade in some, might be worthy of praise in Solomon. The law is not so precise. <i>He shall not multiply horses to himself, nor lead back the people into Egypt, being lifted up with the number of his horsemen,</i> Deuteronomy xvii. 16. There is a like prohibition of many wives and treasures."

Junius translates, \"post-horses.\" --- <i>King:</i> so also the Septuagint. Protestants, \"<i>the officers</i> were, every man according to his charge.\" The twelve governors employed others to bring all necessary provisions, (Haydock) to the places where the king was travelling; (Calmet) or they took care not only of the king's table, but they had also the general inspection over his stables. (Haydock) --- Few oats are grown in the East. They feed their horses on barley and straw. (Calmet)"

The Greeks acknowledged that they had received their philosophy from the barbarians; (Laert. proem.) and Casaubon observes, that the ancient defendants of the Christian faith proved the same truth. (Not. Ibid.) They shewed that all true saving knowledge had been derived from the Hebrews. (Haydock) --- The Chaldeans maintain that their countrymen were the fountains of science; and many suppose that Abraham communicated these treasures to the Egyptians; whereas the latter pretend, that a colony from their country had imparted that blessing to the Chaldeans. Diodorus (B. i.) says that Belus conducted such a colony, and the Greeks chiefly owed their information to the <i>Egyptians.</i> God had communicated to Solomon all that was of real use in those sciences, in a superior degree, Wisdom vii. 17. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] viii. 2.) He was eminently skilled in natural philosophy, &c. (Calmet)'

(Haydock) --- Ethan is the same as Idithun. The title of Ezrahite does not seem to belong to him; and Chalcol and Dorda seem to be inserted here by some transcriber from 1 Paralipomenon ii. 6., where we read, <i>the sons of Zara....Ethan and Eman, and Chalchal and Dara,</i> of the tribe of Juda. But they were different from these men, who were probably Levites. (Calmet) --- We find Chalcol and Dorda mentioned no where else. Heman was an Ezrahite, (Psalm lxxxvii.) and a seer of the king, presiding over the singers, (1 Paralipomenon xv. 19., and xxv. 4., and 5.; Menochius) who stood in the middle. Ethan's band surrounded the altar, (1 Paralipomenon vi. 44.) while Asaph's were on the right hand. --- <i>Mahol</i> was the mother of the four, unless the word denote their profession, as <i>sons of</i> \"the choir,\" singing and playing on musical instruments.

The book of Proverbs contains at present only 658, (Cornelius a Lapide) or 800 parables. (Clarius) --- Josephus exaggerates, when he reads 3000 volumes of parables. --- <i>Five.</i> Septuagint read, "5000 odes," which is adopted by many interpreters.

(Calmet) --- On Libanus there are found such trees above 36 feet in circumference; which extend their branches 111 feet around them. (Maundrell, Jerus. p. 239.) --- Solomon examined all, Wisdom vii. 17, &c. Many works have been falsely attributed to him, which Origen rejects: hom. 35, in Matthew.

      v:001:
        - "1KI:5:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Hiram.</i> Josephus says, that the temple was built in the 11th year of this prince. He must therefore have been the son of David's friend, as the former had sent artificers to build David's house, (2 Kings v. 11.; Calmet) above 30 years before. But there may be a mistake in the number, as the Scripture evidently speaks of the same king; and Josephus had said before, \"Hiram rejoiced exceedingly that Solomon had succeeded to the throne; (for he had been the friend of David) and he sent ambassadors to congratulate with him on his present felicity, by whom Solomon wrote,\" &c. The mutual letters of these kings were still preserved in the archives of Tyre; and this author confidently appeals to them, as he deems it \"impious to insert any fiction\" in his history. (Josephus, Antiquities viii. 2.) He quotes Dius and Menander; who asserted, that these princes proposed enigmas to each other; and that Hiram was obliged to pay a large sum of money, as he could not explain that which Solomon had proposed, &c. (Josephus, contra Apion i.) (Haydock)"

The cedar-trees grow chiefly towards Phenicia, above Biblos. They bear a great resemblance with fir-trees, and grow in a pyramidical form. The wood is hard and bitter, so that worms will not molest it. Hence it was much used in the temple of Ephesus, and in other large buildings; <i>lacunaria ex ea....propter æternitatem sunt facta.</i> (Vitruvius ii. 9.) --- <i>Sidonians.</i> It seems they were subject to the king of Tyre, or this was the common title of all the Phenicians.

See chap. xx. 28., and 4 Kings xvii. 27. (Calemt) --- Thus many think that they may serve the God of unity, by going to hear the sermons of men who preach a contradictory doctrine. The devil will be satisfied, if he can share the divine honours: but God will admit of no rival, nor can he sanction any but the true religion. (Haydock)'

(Calmet) --- <i>Beroshim,</i> is rendered fir-trees by Pagnin; box or cedars, &c., by others. The precise import of the Hebrew names of plants, animals, &c., is not sufficiently known.

(Piscator, &c.) --- The Septuagint, Syriac, &c., read 20,000. (Calmet) --- The Alexandrian copy has not <i>core,</i> but only <i>beth,</i> (Haydock) or \"bath,\" which is a smaller measure, containing 29 pints and something more, (Calmet) or seven gallons, four pints, English wine measure; whereas the core, or chomer, consisted of 75 gallons, five pints.

      v:006: '1KI:5:6 | 6 | 6 | Give orders, therefore, that thy servants cut me down cedar-trees, out of Libanus, and let my servants be with thy servants: and I will give thee the hire of thy servants whatsoever thou wilt ask: for thou knowest how there is not among my people a man that has skill to hew wood like to the Sidonians.'
      v:007: '1KI:5:7 | 7 | 7 | Now when Hiram had heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced exceedingly, and said: Blessed be the Lord God this day, who hath given to David a very wise son over this numerous people.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "1KI:6:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Eightieth year.</i> This chronology meets with the approbation of most people. See Usher. (Chap. xii.) Some, however, find a difficulty in reconciling it with Acts xiii. 20., which seems to attribute 450 years to the government of the judges. (Calmet) --- Septuagint have 440; Josephus 592, though Ruffin neglects the 90 in his version; Petau 520; Severus 582; Clement of Alexandria 566; Vossius 580; Cano 590; Serarius 680. --- Houbigant would read 350 in the Acts. But Capellus would add 100 here, &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Second</i> of the sacred year, corresponding with our April. Syriac, Chaldean styles it \"of the splendour of flowers.\" (Menochius) --- The Hurons, and other nations of America, call this \"the moon of plants;\" the Flemings, \"the month for mowing,\" <i>Grasmaand.</i> Our Saxon ancestors gave descriptive names to the months. See Verstegan. (Haydock) --- At first, the Hebrews only described the months by their order; \"first, second,\" &c. In Solomon's time we begin to find other names, taken from the Phenicians, (Scaliger) Chaldean names were adopted; (Haydock) <b>1.</b> Nisan; <b>2.</b> Jar; <b>3.</b> Sivan; <b>4.</b> Tammus; <b>5.</b> Ab; <b>6.</b> Elul; <b>7.</b> Tisri; <b>8.</b> Marshevan; <b>9.</b> Casleu; <b>10.</b> Thebet; <b>11.</b> Schebet; <b>12.</b> Adar; (Calmet) <b>13.</b> Veadar, the intercalary month, when requisite, according to the lunar system, which was not perhaps yet adopted. Each of these months generally corresponded with two of ours; Nisan with the end of March and the beginning of April, &c. Septuagint here take no notice of Zio, though they do, ver. 37. (Haydock) --- The temple was begun on Monday, May 21, in the year of the world 2992. (Usher) --- It was finished in the year of the world 3000, or in the following year, when it was solemnly dedicated. (Button.)"
      v:002:
        - "1KI:6:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>House.</i> Hebrew <i>Habayith,</i> \"the palace\" of the God of Israel, where the priests alone had access. It was surrounded by various courts and apartments, as the ancient temples were very different from ours. All these appendages sometimes go under the common name of the temple. (Calmet) --- <i>Cubits.</i> The common one contained half a yard. The sacred cubit amounted to 21,888 inches. (Arbuthnot) (Ezechiel xliii. 13.) --- Calmet makes the cubit consist of 24 fingers' breadth, or little less than 20 inches of the French measure, which is greater than ours. (Haydock) --- Hence the temple would be 102½ feet long, 34 feet 2 inches broad, 51 feet 3 inches high to the ceiling. (Calmet) --- The walls are not included; else the breadth would be almost 60 cubits, the length 100, and the height 50. (Vallalpand ii. 5, 14.) (Menochius)"
      v:003:
        - '1KI:6:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Temple.</i> The porch was of the same height as the temple, though we read that it wa 120 cubits high, 2 Paralipomenon iii. 4. But one word seems there to have been substituted for another, (Calmet) unless it might resemble a high tower. (Haydock) --- Before the porch were placed the two brazen pillars. The interior of it was highly adorned by Herod. (Josephus, Antiquities xv. 11.)'
      v:004:
        - '1KI:6:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Oblique windows.</i> Which were made slanting, that the light might be more easily communicated within. (Haydock) --- On the outside they were not so large. (Worthington) (Menochius) --- Hebrew, "windows to see through, shut," with lattices, (Calmet) or blinds. Protestants, "he made windows of narrow lights." (Haydock) --- Curtains might be hung before them, as no glass was yet used. (Calmet) --- These windows occupied the five cubits above the chambers, which were built on the west end, and on the sides of the temple, 15 cubits high. (Calmet) --- No windows were permitted in the holy of holies. (Menochius)'
      v:005:

(Challoner) --- <i>Sides.</i> Protestants, "he made chambers round about." (Haydock) --- Some think that buttresses were used, to strengthen the building. Septuagint, "ribs," (Menochius) or sides. But there seem rather to have been three off-sets; so that the wall kept decreasing in breadth, as it grew higher, (Haydock) every ten cubits, (Ezechiel xli. 6.; Menochius) and thus the upper chamber was two cubits broader than the lowest. The beams might thus rest upon the walls, and be easily changed. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - '1KI:6:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Temple.</i> This was done for greater respect, and that the walls might not be injured. Ezechiel (xli. 6,) counts 33 chambers on the three sides. St. Jerome seems to double that number; while Josephus acknowledges only 30. (Calmet) --- Salien has 42, or 14 in each story.'
      v:007:
        - "1KI:6:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Made ready,</i> &c. So the stones for the building of God's eternal temple, in the heavenly Jerusalem, (who are the faithful) must first be hewn and polished here by many trials and sufferings, before they can be admitted to have a place in that celestial structure. (Challoner) --- Those who have the happiness to be chosen, will be no more disturbed with the <i>noise</i> or inconvenience of persecution, (Haydock) which they ought to bear in silence upon earth. (Worthington) --- <i>Building.</i> Screw nails were probably used. The ancient Romans wrought the mouldings, &c., of their pillars, after they were erected. The Rabbins pretend that a little worm, or stone <i>schamir,</i> which was brought from the earthly paradise by an eagle, or by the devil, Asmodeus, polished all the stones. Maimonides has even written a book on this famous worm. (Grotius) --- Theodoret (q. 23.) also asserts, without proof, that the stones were found ready cut, in the quarry, and that they had only to be polished. We may form a grand idea of the workmen employed by Solomon, when we consider that they were able to prepare all things, with such exactitude, at a distance. (Calmet)"
      v:008:
        - '1KI:6:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Middle side.</i> Septuagint, "lower story." (Calmet) --- "The door of the lower story (rib or side, {GREEK:START pleuras}πληυρασ{GREEK:END}; Chaldean, the lower appendage) was under the right wing of the house, and a winding staircase <i>led</i> to the middle, and from the middle to the third story. (Haydock) --- This sense is very clear. Hebrew intimates that the staircase was <i>round</i> like a screw, and was formed in the wall, at one end of the rooms. --- <i>Right hand</i> of those who entered the temple, or on the north; though the south is commonly thus designated. The doors opened into the porch, as the temple was not to be made a thoroughfare. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - '1KI:6:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Roofs.</i> Protestants, "beams and boards of cedar." None of the stones appeared within, ver. 18. (Haydock)'

        - '1KI:6:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Height.</i> To prevent the excessive heats. Five other cubits were also subtracted, ver. 20. Some translate, "he made also stories of all the temple, each five cubits high;" so that the three stories occupied half the height of the walls, which were 30 cubits in height, ver. 2. (Calmet) --- <i>Covered.</i> Hebrew, "took (or bound together) the house," &c. The roof was flat. (Calmet) --- Villalpand maintains the contrary, (in Ezechiel xli.) with Sanchez, &c. Salien gathers from many of the ancients, that the floor here mentioned, was a balustrade, or <i>the pinnacle of the temple,</i> (Matthew iv.) where people might walk or pray. (Menochius)'
      v:011:
        - '1KI:6:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Saying.</i> By the prophet Ahia, as the Jews suppose he was sent thrice to Solomon. The temple had been commenced two years; (Salien) or this apparition took place after the dedication, and is related more at length; (chap. ix. 2.; Calmet) though the former opinion seems more agreeable to the context, <i>art building,</i> &c. Instead of <i>as for,</i> (Haydock) we might supply <i>stabit.</i> "This house....shall stand;" (Salien) or simply, God looks down upon the building with complacency, and says, "This is the house," by way of eminence. As thou hast endeavoured to honour my name, I will not only fulfil my promises to David, but I will be ever ready to grant thy just requests, in this holy place, provided thou continue faithful, with thy subjects, and obey my commands. (Haydock)'
      v:015:
        - '1KI:6:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Fir.</i> Or perhaps of another species of cedar, resembling the juniper-tree. It is found in Phœnecian and in Lycia. See chap. v. 8. It is doubted whether the sanctuary was also boarded, as we read that it was paved with marble. Hebrew, "with precious or costly stones," 2 Paralipomenon iii. 6. But boards might be laid upon them, as they were on other parts of the temple. The magnificence of Solomon appears in his using such costly things, even where they would not be exposed to view. The floor was again covered with plates of gold, ver. 30.'
      v:016:
        - '1KI:6:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>The inner house of the oracle.</i> That is, the sanctuary, which he separated from the other part of the temple, with this partition of cedar, instead of the veil, which in the tabernacle of Moses hung before the sanctuary. (Challoner) --- It was a square of 20 cubits, extending from the western end. (Haydock) --- Hither none but the high priest was allowed to enter, and he but once a year. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - '1KI:6:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Itself.</i> Where the priests were stationed. This part was double the length, but of the same breadth, as the most holy place. (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - '1KI:6:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Out.</i> Hebrew, "and the cedar boards of the house within, were carved with knops (fruits) and open flowers," (Haydock) alternately. (Calmet) --- <i>At all.</i> So the bones in the human body, though concealed, strengthen it; and monks, in their deserts, fortify the Church. (Worthington)'
      v:020:
        - '1KI:6:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Pure gold.</i> Hebrew, "reserved" by David, or "gold locked up," as most precious. Thin plates were laid on, so as to fit all the various mouldings, flowers, &c. --- <i>Cedar.</i> The altar was probably of stone, and upon the cedar boards gold was laid, that the ark might rest upon it. The altar of perfumes was not in the most holy place. (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - '1KI:6:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Before,</i> ver. 17. The holy and the most holy place were equally covered with plates of gold. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "So Solomon overlaid the inner temple with gold reserved, and he made a partition with chains of gold, before the sanctuary, and he overlaid it with gold." (Haydock) --- the chains were destined to fasten the doors, before locks were invented.'
      v:023:
        - "1KI:6:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Olive.</i> Hebrew, \"trees full of oil <i>or</i> resin,\" distinguished from olive trees, 2 Esdras viii. 15. Vatable translates, \"pine;\" others, \"cypress-wood.\" (Calmet) --- <i>Height.</i> Their gigantic stature served to denote the magnificence and greatness of God. They looked towards the east. (Menochius) --- Their wings extended equalled their height; so that the two cherubims occupied the whole space from north to south, (Haydock) covering the smaller cherubim of Moses. They only reached half the height of the sanctuary. Their form is not clearly ascertained. See Exodus xxv. 18. (Calmet) --- What will the Iconoclasts say to these images, which adorned not only the temple, which the people might behold, but also the most sacred place? (Haydock) --- Villalpand and Salien suppose, that a cherub resembled a young man in the higher parts, adorned with four wings of an eagle and a lion's skin, round his breast and shoulders, while his feet were like those of a calf. (Menochius) --- Ezechiel seems to insinuate that, in the temple, the cherubim had two faces, one of a man and another of a lion, each looking at palm-trees; as these were placed alternately with cherubim, round the walls, Ezechiel xli. 18, 19."
      v:029:
        - "1KI:6:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>And divers,</i> &c. Hebrew, \"and open (full-blown) flowers within and without\" the sanctuary. We read also of chains of gold connected together, 2 Paralipomenon iii. 5. The palm-trees might resemble pillars of the Corinthian order. (Calmet) --- It is clear that sacred pictures were authorized to be set up in the temple, for God's honour, (Worthington) though the Jews were so prone to idolatry. (Haydock)"
      v:031:
        - '1KI:6:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Corners,</i> each piece being, perhaps, a cubit in length, so that the two folding-doors would contain ten cubits, or half the wall. But Ezechiel only assigns six cubits to this door, and ten to that of which opened into the holy place. Hebrew, "the lintel and the side posts, a fifth" <i>of the wall;</i> in which sense, the door must not have been above four cubits. So ver. 33, <i>four-square</i> is translated also, "a fourth part." But it does not appear to what it refers. <i>Rebihith</i> sometimes means four-square; and why may not <i>chamishith</i> here signify pentagonal? (Calmet) --- Many suppose that the gate of the sanctuary was of this form, (Haydock) ending in a point at the top; unless the posts were carved so as to have five angles, like a pillar. (Ribera, Templ. ii. 8.) (Menochius)'
      v:032:
        - '1KI:6:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>And carvings,</i> &c. Hebrew, "and flowers full-blown." The term <i>anaglypha,</i> denotes a sculpture in relievo, (Calmet) or projecting. (Haydock)'
      v:034:
        - '1KI:6:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Fir-tree,</i> or some species of cedar, ver. 15. --- <i>Double.</i> In the large doors, other smaller were made, that the priests might pass more easily. (Menochius) --- <i>And so,</i> &c. Literally, "and holding each other, was opened." Both the great and the small doors might open at the same time; (Sanchez) or rather the latter would afford a passage, while the great folding doors were shut. (Menochius) --- Perhaps both the doors of the holy place and of the sanctuary were so connected, that both opened together. (Tract. Middot. iv. 1.) (Calmet) --- But the sanctuary would never be thus exposed to public view. Protestants, "two leaves of one door w<i>ere</i> folding," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:035:
        - '1KI:6:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>And carved,</i> &c. Hebrew, "and open flowers, (as ver. 32) and overlaid them with gold, fitted upon the sculpture;" (Haydock) so that the shape of every thing appeared.'
      v:036:
        - '1KI:6:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Court</i> of the priests. --- <i>Cedar.</i> Some think that the court was surrounded with galleries, supported on three rows of pillars; or one gallery was above another, on pillars of stone, with a third supported by cedar pillars. (Menochius) --- But Josephus takes no notice of these galleries. Others think that the wall of separation consisted only of two rows of stone, with a third of wood, in all three cubits high. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] viii. 2.) (Villalpand) --- But the sacred writers seem rather to indicate, that beams of cedar were fixed in the walls, at the distance of three courses of stone, even to the top. This mode of architecture is clearly mentioned, chap. vii. 12., 1 Esdras vi. 3, 4., and v. 8., and Habacuc ii. 11. The ancients admired such a variety, and deemed the building more solid. (Vit. i. 5.) Eupolemus (ap. Eusebius, præp. ix. 34.) takes notice, that these beams were fastened together, in the temple, by hooks of copper, weighing each a talent. (Haydock) --- Such was the structure of the inner court. (Calmet)'
      v:038:
        - '1KI:6:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Bul,</i> afterwards styled Marchesvan. Pagnin thinks that the former name alludes to "the inundation" of rain, at that season, corresponding with our October and November. Chaldean, "the month of collected fruits." (Menochius) --- <i>Years.</i> Six months are neglected, (see chap. ii. 11.) and as many are redundant, chap. vii. 1. Odd numbers are often treated in this manner. (Calmet) --- It is wonderful that Solomon could complete this most stupendous structure (Haydock) in so short a time. All Asia was 200 years in building the temple of Diana, at Ephesus, and 400 more in embellishing it. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxvi. 12.) --- It is reported that 360,000 men were employed for twenty years, to build a pyramid of Egypt; (Calmet) which was designed, perhaps for no other purpose but to shew the pride and magnificence of the king while living, and to contain his ashes after death. Many of the materials for the temple had indeed been collected by David, (1 Paralipomenon xxii.) so that Solomon was enabled to finish it in a much shorter time than his own palace, which took him almost <i>thirteen years</i> to bring <i>to perfection.</i> They were almost contiguous to each other, though built on separate hills. The temple occupied the whole of Moria, which was levelled a great deal, to allow space sufficient for such an amazing structure. It was thus founded upon a rock, as an emblem of the perpetuity of the true religion, which has subsisted from the beginning of the world: as may be seen at large in Dr. Worthington; who, on this occasion, gives a retrospective view of what had taken place in the Jewish state, with respect to this most important subject, during the fourth age, or for the space of the last 480 years. See Douay Bible, p. 701, &c. We may be dispensed from repeating these things after him, as they are already, for the most part, observed in the notes; where the attentive reader cannot fail to remark, that the law of the Old Testament was only a figure of that which all must now embrace. <i>I am not come to destroy,</i> (the law or the prophets) says our Saviour, (Matthew v. 17.) <i>but to fulfil,</i> by accomplishing all the figures and predictions, and by perfecting all that was imperfect, though suitable for the state of mortals in former ages. Children cannot rationally be required to attain, at once, the perfection of manhood. The painter first marks the outlines, which the colouring is calculated to efface, yet so as to render the picture more beautiful. "The cunning Jew" would therefore, in vain, allege the greater antiquity of his religion, as it prefigured and foretold the <i>author and finisher of our faith.</i> And Protestants will act very childishly if they suppose, with Mr. Slack, a Methodist preacher, at Whitby, that this can in any degree enervate the argument of Catholics, who always arraign them before the tribunal of the apostolic ages, in which they confess our bishops, <i>Linus,</i> &c., existed, and were ordained by the apostles themselves. "Setting aside the apostles, Linus, agreeably to the common opinion, was the first bishop of the Roman see, who was ordained before the martyrdom both of Peter and Paul." Campbell, 12 lect., quoted by Mr. Slack; (p. 63) who says that he was the first pope, and of course, that our religion mounts up to the age of the apostles; and, if he thinks to evade this difficulty, by saying, that the Jewish religion was more ancient still, and yet rejected, we may desire him to point out where the Scripture mentions that the religion of Christ was to be rendered more perfect than he left it; as we know from that source, that he was to establish a new law, founded on <i>better promises</i> than those which had been made to the Jew? How will this state of fluctuation, and this relapsing into abominable errors and idolatry, for many hundred years, accord with the promises of Christ? (Matthew xxviii., &c.) (Haydock) --- <i>Building it.</i> The dedication was deferred till the following year, probably on account of the jubilee recurring at that time. (Usher, the year of the world 3000.) (Calmet) --- But this is very uncertain. Salien fixes upon the year 3030, which was not a year of jubilee; and he rather thinks that the delay was occasioned by the vessels, the brazen sea, &c., which had to be brought from the other side of the Jordan. We may also recollect, that the rainy season was set in before the temple was quite finished; so that it would have been very inconvenient for all Israel to assemble at that time. After the dedication, the temple continued to be adorned, till it was destroyed by Nebuchadonoser, (Haydock) in the year 3416, and lay in ruins fifty-two years, when the Jews were authorized by Cyrus to rebuild it. They could not however finish the work, so as to proceed to a fresh dedication, till the reign of Darius Hystaspes, in the year 3489. Herod undertook to rebuild (Button) the greatest part of this second temple, and to adorn it, in the most magnificent manner, in the year 3986. This place was honoured by the presence of the Son of God, who foretold the destruction, which took place within that <i>generation,</i> [in] A.D. 70. (Haydock)'

      v:001: '1KI:6:1 | 1 | 1 | And {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of the reign of Solomon over Israel, in the month Zio, (the same is the second month) he began to build a house to the Lord.'
      v:002: '1KI:6:2 | 2 | 2 | And the house, which king Solomon built to the Lord, was threescore cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and thirty cubits in height.'
      v:003: '1KI:6:3 | 3 | 3 | And there was a porch before the temple, of twenty cubits in length, according to the measure of the breadth of the temple: and it was ten cubits in breadth, before the face of the temple.'
      v:004: 1KI:6:4 | 4 | 4 | And he made in the temple oblique windows.
      v:005: '1KI:6:5 | 5 | 5 | And upon the wall of the temple, he built floors round about, in the walls of the house, round about the temple and the oracle, and he made <i>chambers in the</i> sides round about.'
      v:006: '1KI:6:6 | 6 | 6 | The floor that was underneath was five cubits in breadth, and the middle floor was six cubits in breadth, and the third door was seven cubits in breadth. And he put beams in the house round about on the outside, that they might not be fastened in the walls of the temple.'
      v:007: '1KI:6:7 | 7 | 7 | And the house, when it was in building, was built of stones, hewed and made ready: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house when it was in building.'
      v:008: '1KI:6:8 | 8 | 8 | The door, for the middle side, was on the right hand of the house: and by winding-stairs they went up to the middle room, and from the middle to the third.'
      v:009: '1KI:6:9 | 9 | 9 | So he built the house, and finished it: and he covered the house with roofs of cedar.'
      v:010: '1KI:6:10 | 10 | 10 | And he built a floor over all the house, five cubits in height, and he covered the house with timber of cedar.'
      v:011: '1KI:6:11 | 11 | 11 | And the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying:'
      v:012: '1KI:6:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>As for</i> this house, which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments, walking in them, I will fulfil my word to thee, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}which I spoke to David thy father.'
      v:013: '1KI:6:13 | 13 | 13 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.'
      v:014: '1KI:6:14 | 14 | 14 | So Solomon built the house, and finished it.'
      v:015: '1KI:6:15 | 15 | 15 | And he built the walls of the house on the inside, with boards of cedar, from the floor of the house to the top of the walls, and to the roofs, he covered it with boards of cedar on the inside: and he covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.'
      v:016: '1KI:6:16 | 16 | 16 | And he built up twenty cubits with boards of cedar at the hinder part of the temple, from the floor to the top: and made the inner house of the oracle to be the holy of holies.'
      v:017: '1KI:6:17 | 17 | 17 | And the temple itself, before the doors of the oracle, was forty cubits long.'
      v:018: '1KI:6:18 | 18 | 18 | And all the house was covered within with cedar, having the turnings, and the joints thereof artfully wrought, and carvings projecting out: all was covered with boards of cedar: and no stone could be seen in the wall at all.'
      v:019: '1KI:6:19 | 19 | 19 | And he made the oracle in the midst of the house, in the inner part, to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.'
      v:020: '1KI:6:20 | 20 | 20 | Now the oracle was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in height. And he covered it, and overlaid it with most pure gold. And the altar also he covered with cedar.'
      v:021: '1KI:6:21 | 21 | 21 | And the house before the oracle he overlaid with most pure gold, and fastened on the plates with nails of gold.'
      v:022: '1KI:6:22 | 22 | 22 | And there was nothing in the temple that was not covered with gold: the whole altar of the oracle he covered also with gold.'
      v:023: '1KI:6:23 | 23 | 23 | And he made in the oracle two cherubims of olive-tree, of ten cubits in height.'
      v:024: '1KI:6:24 | 24 | 24 | One wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub was five cubits: that is, in all ten cubits, from the extremity of one wing to the extremity of the other wing.'
      v:025: '1KI:6:25 | 25 | 25 | The second cherub also was ten cubits: and the measure, and the work was the same in both the cherubims:'
      v:026: '1KI:6:26 | 26 | 26 | That is to say, one cherub was ten cubits high, and in like manner the other cherub.'
      v:027: '1KI:6:27 | 27 | 27 | And he set the cherubims in the midst of the inner temple: and the cherubims stretched forth their wings, and the wing of the one touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall: and the other wings in the midst of the temple touched one another.'
      v:028: 1KI:6:28 | 28 | 28 | And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
      v:029: '1KI:6:29 | 29 | 29 | And all the walls of the temple round about he carved with divers figures and carvings: and he made in them cherubims and palm-trees, and divers representations, as it were standing out, and coming forth from the wall.'
      v:030: 1KI:6:30 | 30 | 30 | And the floor of the house he also overlaid with gold within and without.
      v:031: '1KI:6:31 | 31 | 31 | And in the entrance of the oracle, he made little doors of olive-tree, and posts of five corners,'
      v:032: '1KI:6:32 | 32 | 32 | And two doors of olive-tree: and he carved upon them figures of cherubims, and figures of palm-trees, and carvings very much projecting; and he overlaid them with gold: and he covered both the cherubims and the palm-trees, and the other things, with gold.'
      v:033: '1KI:6:33 | 33 | 33 | And he made in the entrance of the temple posts of olive-tree four-square:'
      v:034: '1KI:6:34 | 34 | 34 | And two doors of fir-tree, one of each side: and each door was double, and so opened with folding-leaves.'
      v:035: '1KI:6:35 | 35 | 35 | And he carved cherubims, and palm-trees, and carved work standing very much out: and he overlaid all with golden plates in square work by rule.'
      v:036: '1KI:6:36 | 36 | 36 | And he built the inner court with three rows of polished stones, and one row of beams of cedar.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "1KI:7:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Thirteen.</i> He was only twelve years and a half; since he finished both the temple and the palace in 20 years, chap. ix. 10. Salien observes that Solomon's house was connected with the queen's, as well as with that part which was styled <i>of the forest of Libanus,</i> for their mutual recreation, the year before Christ 1023. The Roman Septuagint places the 13 first verses at the end, ver. 51. (Haydock)"
      v:002:
        - '1KI:7:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Libanus.</i> So it was called, on account of the many cedar pillars brought from that mountain; or because many trees and shrubs were planted in the vicinity. (Calmet) --- Libanus might also be seen from it, and refreshing breezes be felt. (Ar.[Arbuthnot?] Mont.[Montanus?]) --- The palace stood on the eastern part of Sion, and to the west of the temple. (Menochius) --- The vale between them had been filled up, at a vast expense, and a sort of bridge erected, which was called Mello. Thus the palace of David, on the west of Sion, and this of Solomon, served to protect the temple, and to keep the citizens in awe. (Salien) --- Sanchez declines giving the dimensions of this palace, as they are not satisfactory. (Menochius) --- Here Solomon resided, and was served in gold, (Calmet) adorning his palace with shields and targets of the same precious metal, chap. x. 16, 21. --- <i>Cubits.</i> The more sacred part of the temple was only 60, 20, and 30 cubits, chap. vi. 2. But there were various other appendages and towers. This palace must have been very extensive. --- <i>And four.</i> Hebrew, "upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars." (Haydock) -- One row of these might be rather pilasters, against the wall; (ver. 3,) so that there would be three covered galleries, before the apartments, each supported on 15 pillars. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - '1KI:7:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Set,</i> &c. Hebrew, "and windows in three rows, over-against one another; (<b>5</b>) and all the doors and posts square with the windows: and light was against light, in three rows." (Haydock) --- The palace had three stories; but the galleries before it were of equal height with it.'
      v:006:
        - '1KI:7:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Porch.</i> Septuagint seem to retain the original word <i>ulam,</i> as they read {GREEK:START ailam}αιλαμ{GREEK:END}; whence our <i>hall,</i> and the Latin <i>aula,</i> may be derived. (Haydock) --- It was a court surrounded by pillars and galleries, in front of the palace. (Calmet) --- <i>Another.</i> Hebrew, "the porch before them, (pillars) and the pillars, and the thick beam before them."'
      v:007:
        - '1KI:7:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Tob.</i> Hebrew, "the other side." (Haydock) --- The eastern princes generally sit before their palace to give judgment; and hence that of the Ottoman emperors is styled <i>the Porte,</i> (Calmet) or "gate."'
      v:008:
        - "1KI:7:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>House.</i> In the form of a recess or alcove, at the end of one of the aforesaid porches, and probably in that which was nearer the palace. Guards would be stationed in the other. (Haydock) --- This is the idea which travellers have given us of the palaces in the East. They consist of various apartments, galleries, and courts. Under the outward porch there are guards standing, in a double row; and hence there is a communication with other parts of the house, and with the apartments of the women, which are far removed, and inaccessible to strangers. The women still continue to have separate tents, or apartments; as they had in the days of Sara, Esther, Herodias, &c., Genesis xxiv., Esther i. 11., and Matthew xiv. 8. (Calmet) --- <i>Pharao.</i> Till it was finished, this lady had lodged in David's palace; though as it was deemed in a manner sacred, on account of the presence of the <i>ark,</i> it was judged expedient to remove her, 2 Paralipomenon viii. 11. (Haydock) --- Perhaps she had begun to manifest some signs of a relapse towards idolatry, into which she is supposed chiefly to have induced her husband, chap. xi. 4. (Salien)"
      v:012:
        - '1KI:7:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Cedar,</i> in regular courses with the stones, chap. vi. 36. Public places were often made in a circular form, and were thus rendered more beautiful. The palace of Solomon might have enclosed the court in this manner, or there were buildings on all the four sides, made of three courses of fine large stones, with the fourth of cedar beams, till the whole was completed. The ancients built for posterity, as we may perceive from the huge stones, well connected, which still reman in the ruins of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman architecture.'
      v:014:
        - '1KI:7:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Nephthali:</i> 2 Paralipomenon (ii. 14,) we read <i>of Dan.</i> But the king of Tyre might be under a mistake, (Sanctius) or he may only insinuate that she lived at the city of that name, in the tribe of Nephthali. (Menochius) --- One of her husbands might be a Danite, (Grotius) though resident at Tyre. --- <i>Father,</i> may also denote a master or officer; in which sense we read in Paralipomenon, <i>My father, Hiram.</i> (Haydock) (St. Jerome, Trad.) (Menochius) --- If the woman married an idolater, it was contrary to the law: (Calmet) though Grotius maintains the contrary, when the free exercise of religion was granted.'
      v:015:
        - '1KI:7:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Eighteen.</i> Both together are said in Paralipomenon to be 35, as if half a cubit too much had been here assigned, which is not unusual with regard to imperfect numbers, ver. 1. But Jeremias (lii. 21,) agrees with this passage; and the book of Paralipomenon may not have included a cubit of <i>solid</i> metal at the base or plinth. (Cornelius a Lapide) --- The rest was hollow. The chapiters of five cubits, and the bases, which were perhaps as large, are not contained in the 18 cubits, which might otherwise appear to be disproportionate with the circumference of 12 cubits. The Egyptian pillars are sometimes very thick and low; and their temples bear a great resemblance with that of Solomon, than with those of the Greeks and Romans. (Calmet) --- <i>Both.</i> Hebrew, "the second," as if something similar had been observed of the first. (Calmet) --- But <i>Sheni,</i> signifies also "both, either," &c. (Menochius) --- Protestants, "did compass either of them about." (Haydock) --- Circles, at equal distances, adorned these pillars, Exodus xxvi. 32. (Atheneus v. 9.)'
      v:016:
        - '1KI:7:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Five.</i> Comprising all the ornaments. The body was only three cubits, 4 Kings xxv. 17. If we include the circles, which join it to the pillar, it would be four; ver. 19, and with the rose, and ornaments at the top, five cubits high. Atheneus distinguishes three parts in the Egyptian chapiters; (<b>1</b>) next to the pillar, was seen a circle or wreath of flowers; (<b>2</b>) the stalk, out of which proceeded (<b>3</b>) a rose beginning to open. (Calmet) --- In the passages, which seem to contradict this text, the omission of the cornice or architrave, may cause the difference. (Menochius)'
      v:018:
        - '1KI:7:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>The pillars.</i> This word may have changed places with <i>pomegranates.</i>'
      v:019:
        - '1KI:7:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Of lily-work,</i> seems also transposed. Calmet would translate, Hebrew, "and he made pomegranates, two rows round each net, to cover the chapiter, which was at the top of the pillar, and in, &c., (<b>19</b>) and the chapiter, which was above the pillars of the court, (or porch) four cubits high. And he made rows of 200 pomegranates, all round, to cover <i>one of the crowns of the pillars, and he did the like for</i> the other crown; (<b>20</b>) and he also made a chapiter, like a rose, (or <i>lily</i>) at the top of the pillars, above, and over-against the body, which was beyond the nets." The rose seemed to grow out of the pillar. The chapiters were not square, but of a circular form. Pelletier supposes that these pillars were of the ancient Doric order. It is certain that all the chapiter was not in the form of a lily, as the Hebrew would now insinuate, but only the top part of it, chap. v. 22. The long addition of <i>one of the crowns,</i> &c., may be unnecessary, if the original signify <i>either;</i> (as [in] ver. 15) "to cover either crown."'
      v:020:
        - '1KI:7:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Chapiter,</i> (<i>capitelli secundi.</i>) (Haydock) --- Villalpand thinks this "second chapiter," is rather the cornice, round which the pomegranates hung. (Menochius) --- Septuagint, "and of roses, five rows, all round, upon the second circle." (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - "1KI:7:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Temple.</i> Against the wall, (Jeremias lii. 23,) on each side of the door which leads to the holy place. The pillars might be 28 cubits high, ver. 15. --- <i>Jachin</i> intimated that God \"will establish.\" --- <i>Booz</i> means, \"strength is in him.\" (Calmet) --- Both together might foretel the stability of the temple. \"He shall establish in strength.\" We have already mentioned the conjecture of Houbigant, that these two pillars were erected in honour of some of Solomon's progenitors, though the former be lost in his genealogy, Ruth iv. 22. (Haydock) --- <i>Jachin.</i> That is, <i>firmly established.</i> --- <i>Booz.</i> That is, <i>in its strength.</i> By recording these names in holy writ, the Spirit of God would have us understand the invincible firmness and strength of the pillars on which the true temple of God, which is the Church, is established. (Challoner)"
      v:022:
        - '1KI:7:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Lily,</i> or rose, as <i>Susan</i> means both. This ornament seems to have been detached from the rest of the chapiter, and one cubit high, ver. 16. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - '1KI:7:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Brim,</i> in diameter. The circumference was <i>about</i> 30 cubits; for it is not exactly three [but <i>pi</i> (3.14159...)] times as much as the diameter. (Calmet) --- The latter is [approximately] as 7 to 22, with respect to the circumference. But the Scripture takes no notice of trifles. (Menochius)'
      v:024:
        - '1KI:7:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Ten cubits.</i> All was not therefore ornamented. Protestants, "<i>there were</i> knops compassing it, ten in a cubit....the knops <i>were</i> cast in two rows, when it was cast." (Haydock) --- The signification of <i>Pekahim</i> is not ascertained, whether it be "apples, balls," &c., or perhaps a corrupt word for <i>Bokrim,</i> "oxen," or "ox heads;" as 2 Paralipomenon (iv. 3,) clearly explains it. (Calmet) --- There also it is insinuated, that the carvings commenced only towards the bottom, where the circumference was reduced to 10 cubits. (Menochius)'
      v:025:
        - '1KI:7:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Oxen.</i> Josephus and the Jews would condemn Solomon for making these figures; but it is clear that his present was acceptable to God, as well as his person. (Calmet) --- <i>Within.</i> The oxen were of solid brass, to support such a weight. (Menochius) --- Some think that the water was discharged through their mouths. But Pelletier believes that there were cocks placed between each of the four divisions of oxen, which let water into a basin below, in which the priests might purify themselves. He supposes also that the vessel was double; the cup would contain 2000 baths, and the foot or basin another 1000, by which means he would reconcile this book with that of Chronicles. (Melanges, T. i. p. 115.)'
      v:026:
        - "1KI:7:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Two thousand bates.</i> That is, about ten thousand gallons. This was the quantity of water which was usually put into it: but it was capable, if brim-full, of holding three thousand. See 2 Paralipomenon iv. 5, 7. (Challoner) --- The batus contained about five gallons. (Worthington) --- Some imagine, without grounds, (Calmet) that the measure in Paralipomenon was of a less capacity. (Vallalpand) (Cornelius a Lapide) --- The smaller is called <i>metreta,</i> \"measure,\" after the Greek, as it had no proper name. (Salien) --- Instead of <i>a hand's breadth,</i> it is literally, \"three ounces,\" or the fourth part of a Roman foot; which is equivalent to four fingers' (Haydock) breadth, or a \"hand's breadth,\" as the Hebrew <i>tophach</i> implies, or a little above three inches. --- <i>Crisped,</i> or \"full-blown lily.\" The Chaldean supposes it was thus ornamented. Hebrew, \"with flowers of lilies,\" (Calmet) or \"roses,\" <i>Shoshan.</i> (Haydock)"
      v:027:
        - 1KI:7:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Bases.</i> These were designed to wash the victims. (Pelletier)
      v:028:
        - '1KI:7:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>And.</i> Hebrew is very obscure in this and the following verse. Indeed interpreters are so little agreed about the precise signification of some of the terms, that it is not necessary to repeat their sentiments.'
      v:032:
        - 1KI:7:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Joined.</i> Yet not so as to be immovable. (Calmet)
      v:036:
        - '1KI:7:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Palm-trees</i> were not expressed, ver. 29. All was in relievo, and represented in its natural posture. (Calmet) --- <i>About.</i> One would have taken them to be alive, they were so well executed. Hebrew, "according to the proportion of every one, and added round about," (Haydock) projecting. (Menochius)'
      v:039:
        - "1KI:7:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Right side,</i> to the south, between the temple and the altar of holocausts. --- <i>Sea.</i> It was the most towards the east, of the five basins, (Calmet) or near the eastern gate of the priests' court, standing to the south of the entrance, that they might purify themselves. (Menochius) --- St. Justin Martyr (apology ii.) observes that the pagans imitated this custom. But this ought not to hinder Christians from employing a thing which is innocent in itself, and calculated to make them aspire to the greatest purity, when they approach to God. (Haydock){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Spargit & ipse suos lauro rorante capillos</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Incipit & solita fundere voce preces.</i> (Ovid, Fast. v.)"
      v:040:
        - '1KI:7:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Shovels. Scutras</i> may also signify "cauldrons," from their resemblance with a shield. These terms occur [in] Exodus xxvii. 3., (Calmet) and are there properly translated, <i>shovels,</i> &c. (Haydock) --- The Jews say there were always, at least, three things of the same species, that one might be ready in case another was defiled.'
      v:041:
        - '1KI:7:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Cords:</i> no mention of these had been made before. The same terms are frequently expressed in a different manner, ver. 15, to 20. Hebrew, "the two pillars and the chapiters round, (Calmet) which <i>were</i> on the top of the pillars and the two nets to cover the two bowls of (or the two circular) chapiters," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:045:
        - '1KI:7:45 | 45 | 45 | <i>Fine brass</i> (<i>aurichalco.</i>) Some pretended that gold was mixed with this sort of brass. But Pliny ([Natural History?] xxxiv. 2.) informs us that it came out of the mines, without dross. --- Hebrew, "polished (or refined) brass." (Calmet) --- It might resemble the Corinthian brass. (Menochius)'
      v:046:
        - '1KI:7:46 | 46 | 46 | <i>Sarthan.</i> This place was on the west, and Socoth on the east of the Jordan, near Bethsan, chap. iv. 12. (Calmet) --- Josue iii. 16. (Haydock) --- Adrichomius places both on the east, in the tribe of Gad. (Menochius)'
      v:047:
        - '1KI:7:47 | 47 | 47 | <i>Weighed.</i> It was deemed unnecessary, and too troublesome. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "And Solomon would not have all the vessels <i>weighed,</i>" on account of the too great number: "the weight of the brass was not discovered." (Vatable)'
      v:048:
        - '1KI:7:48 | 48 | 48 | <i>Altar,</i> not that on which the ark was placed, (chap. vi. 20.; Calmet) though some are of that opinion; (Menochius, &c.) but perhaps the altar of incense. The one which Moses had made was probably too small, (Calmet) and reposited in the treasury. (Rabbins) --- <i>Table.</i> In 1 Paralipomenon iv. 8., we find <i>ten</i> specified, one between each candlestick, in the holy place. Josephus ([Antiquities?] viii. 2.) mentions an incredible number of gold and silver utensils, which are not found in Scripture; and the Rabbins are not sparing in miracles, to promote a respect for the temple. No venomous creature, they say, was ever seen in Jerusalem; nor did man seek for lodgings in vain, &c. The priests were so numerous, that the same person had never to offer the perpetual sacrifice or incense twice in his life. No one durst spit in the temple, nor turn his back on the altar, &c. (Calmet)'

        - '1KI:7:51 | 51 | 51 | <i>Dedicated.</i> Literally, "sanctified," (Haydock) or set apart. (Worthington) --- <i>Gold,</i> unwrought. (Menochius)'

      v:008: '1KI:7:8 | 8 | 8 | And in the midst of the porch, was a small house, where he sat in judgment of the like work. He made also a house for the daughter of Pharao ({VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}whom Solomon had taken to wife) of the same work, as this porch;'
      v:009: '1KI:7:9 | 9 | 9 | All of costly stones, which were sawed by a certain rule and measure, both within and without: from the foundation to the top of the walls, and without, unto the great court.'

      v:013: '1KI:7:13 | 13 | 13 | And king Solomon sent, and brought Hiram from Tyre,'
      v:014: '1KI:7:14 | 14 | 14 | The son of a widow woman, of the tribe of Nephthali, whose father was a Tyrian, an artificer in brass, and full of wisdom, and understanding, and skill to work all work in brass. And when he was come to king Solomon, he wrought all his work.'
      v:015: '1KI:7:15 | 15 | 15 | And he cast two pillars in brass, each pillar was eighteen cubits high: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and a line of twelve cubits compassed both the pillars.'
      v:016: '1KI:7:16 | 16 | 16 | He made also two chapiters of molten brass, to be set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:'
      v:017: '1KI:7:17 | 17 | 17 | And a kind of net-work, and chain-work wreathed together with wonderful art. Both the chapiters of the pillars were cast: seven rows of nets were on one chapiter, and seven nets on the other chapiter.'
      v:018: '1KI:7:18 | 18 | 18 | And he made the pillars, and two rows round about each net-work to cover the chapiters, that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and in like manner did he to the other chapiter.'
      v:019: '1KI:7:19 | 19 | 19 | And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars, were of lily-work, in the porch of four cubits.'
      v:020: '1KI:7:20 | 20 | 20 | And again <i>there were</i> other chapiters on the top of the pillars above, according to the measure of the pillar over-against the net-work: and of pomegranates there were two hundred, in rows round about the other chapiter.'
      v:021: '1KI:7:21 | 21 | 21 | And he set up the two pillars in the porch of the temple: and when he had set up the pillar on the right hand, he called the name thereof Jachin: in like manner he set up the second pillar, and called the name thereof Booz.'
      v:022: '1KI:7:22 | 22 | 22 | And upon the tops of the pillars he made lily-work: so the work of the pillars was finished.'
      v:023: '1KI:7:23 | 23 | 23 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}He made also a molten sea, of ten cubits, from brim to brim, round all about; the height of it was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits compassed it round about.'
      v:024: '1KI:7:24 | 24 | 24 | And a graven work, under the brim of it, compassed it for ten cubits going about the sea: there were two rows cast of chamfered sculptures.'
      v:025: '1KI:7:25 | 25 | 25 | And it stood upon twelve oxen, of which three looked towards the north, and three towards the west, and three towards the south, and three towards the east: and the sea was above upon them, and their hinder parts were all hid within.'
      v:026: '1KI:7:26 | 26 | 26 | And the laver was a handbreadth thick: and the brim thereof was like the brim of a cup, or the leaf of a crisped lily: it contained two thousand bates.'
      v:027: '1KI:7:27 | 27 | 27 | And he made ten bases of brass, every base was four cubits in length, and four cubits in breadth, and three cubits high.'
      v:028: '1KI:7:28 | 28 | 28 | And the work itself of the bases, was intergraven: and there were gravings between the joinings.'
      v:029: '1KI:7:29 | 29 | 29 | And between the little crowns and the ledges, were lions, and oxen, and cherubims: and in the joinings likewise above: and under the lions and oxen, as it were bands of brass hanging down.'
      v:030: '1KI:7:30 | 30 | 30 | And every base had four wheels, and axle-trees of brass: and at the four sides were undersetters, under the laver molten, looking one against another.'
      v:031: '1KI:7:31 | 31 | 31 | The mouth also of the laver within, was in the top of the chapiter: and that which appeared without, was of one cubit all round, and together it was one cubit and a half: and in the corners of the pillars were divers engravings: and the spaces between the pillars were square, not round.'
      v:032: '1KI:7:32 | 32 | 32 | And the four wheels, which were at the four corners of the base, were joined one to another under the base: the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.'
      v:033: '1KI:7:33 | 33 | 33 | And they were such wheels as are used to be made in a chariot: and their axle-trees, and spokes, and strakes, and naves, were all cast.'
      v:034: '1KI:7:34 | 34 | 34 | And the four undersetters, that were at every corner of each base, were of the base itself, cast and joined together.'
      v:035: '1KI:7:35 | 35 | 35 | And in the top of the base, there was a round compass of half a cubit, so wrought that the laver might be set thereon, having its gravings, and divers sculptures of itself.'
      v:036: '1KI:7:36 | 36 | 36 | He engraved also in those plates, which were of brass, and in the corners, cherubims, and lions, and palm-trees, in likeness of a man standing, so that they seemed not to be engraven, but added round about.'
      v:037: '1KI:7:37 | 37 | 37 | After this manner, he made ten bases, of one casting and measure, and the like graving.'
      v:038: '1KI:7:38 | 38 | 38 | He made also ten lavers of brass: one laver contained four bates, and was of four cubits: and upon every base, in all ten, he put as many lavers.'
      v:039: '1KI:7:39 | 39 | 39 | And he set the ten bases, five on the right side of the temple, and five on the left: and the sea he put on the right side of the temple, over-against the east, southward.'
      v:040: '1KI:7:40 | 40 | 40 | And Hiram made cauldrons, and shovels, and basins, and finished all the work of king Solomon in the temple of the Lord.'
      v:041: '1KI:7:41 | 41 | 41 | The two pillars and the two cords of the chapiters, upon the chapiters of the pillars: and the two net-works, to cover the two cords, that were upon the top of the pillars.'
      v:042: '1KI:7:42 | 42 | 42 | And four hundred pomegranates for the two net-works: two rows of pomegranates for each net-work, to cover the cords of the chapiters, which were upon the tops of the pillars.'

      v:044: '1KI:7:44 | 44 | 44 | And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea.'
      v:045: '1KI:7:45 | 45 | 45 | And the cauldrons, and the shovels, and the basins. All the vessels that Hiram made for king Solomon, for the house of the Lord, were of fine brass.'
      v:046: '1KI:7:46 | 46 | 46 | In the plains of the Jordan, did the king cast them in a clay ground, between Socoth and Sarthan.'
      v:047: '1KI:7:47 | 47 | 47 | And Solomon placed all the vessels: but for exceeding great multitude the brass could not be weighed.'
      v:048: '1KI:7:48 | 48 | 48 | And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of the Lord: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, upon which the leaves of proposition should be set:'
      v:049: '1KI:7:49 | 49 | 49 | And the golden candlesticks, five on the right hand, and five on the left, over-against the oracle, of pure gold: and the flowers like lilies, and the lamps over them of gold: and golden snuffers,'
      v:050: '1KI:7:50 | 50 | 50 | And pots, and flesh-hooks, and bowls, and mortars, and censers, of most pure gold: and the hinges for the doors of the inner house of the holy of holies, and for the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.'
      v:051: '1KI:7:51 | 51 | 51 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And Solomon finished all the work that he made in the house of the Lord, and brought in the things that David, his father, had dedicated, the silver and the gold, and the vessels, and laid them up in the treasures of the house of the Lord.'

        - '1KI:8:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Ethanim</i> was afterwards called Tisri. (Haydock) --- Usher places the dedication on Friday, 30th October, the 8th of the seventh month. The people continued at Jerusalem till the 23rd. The feast of expiation fell on the 10th, (Haydock) during the octave of the dedication. After this, the feast of tabernacles commenced on the 15th, for other seven days. This was the year of jubilee; and Solomon had waited on purpose, that the people might have more leisure to attend on such a solemn occasion. (Calmet) --- But on this we cannot rely. There might be other reasons for the delay; (See chap. vi. 38.) and one of the chief might be, a desire to perform this ceremony in the seventh or sabbatical month, which was honoured with more festivals than any other. It had just elapsed, before the temple was finished, in the preceding year. (Haydock)'

Jeremias was authorized to take the ark, the tabernacle, and the altar of incense, in order to prevent their falling into the hands of the Chaldeans. He placed them in a cave, where they have never, perhaps, been discovered, 2 Machabees ii. 4.'
      v:005:
        - '1KI:8:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Sacrificed,</i> by the hands of the priests, (Menochius) or at least (Haydock) gave them the blood to offer upon the altars, which were placed at six paces from one another, in imitation of David, 2 Kings vi. 13. (Calmet) --- <i>Could not.</i> See chap. vii. 47.'
      v:006:
        - '1KI:8:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Wings.</i> These covered the smaller cherubim, upon the ark. (Haydock) (Chap. vi. 23, 27.) --- They formed a sort of throne, with their wings extended, from one side of the building to the other, (Calmet) twenty cubits long. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - '1KI:8:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Out.</i> In the days of Moses, these staves had touched the veil of the tabernacle: but now, as the place for the ark was twice as large, they were no longer perceived; though they remained in the holes prepared for them by Moses, till the author wrote; which must have been before the captivity. Unless we thus distinguish the times, the Hebrew contains a palpable contradiction. (Calmet) --- "They drew out (or lengthened) the staves, and the heads....were seen out in the holy place....and they were not seen out." (Haydock) --- To a person standing at a small distance, they were not visible, though they rather touched the veil, 2 Paralipomenon v. 9. (Menochius)'
      v:009:
        - '1KI:8:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Nothing else,</i> &c. There was nothing else but the tables of the law <i>within</i> the ark. But on the outside of the ark, or near the ark, were also the rod of Aaron, and a golden urn with manna, Hebrews ix. 4. (Challoner) (Worthington) --- These might have been in the ark while it was not fixed: but after the temple was built, all but the tables were placed in the treasury; where, we find, the book of the law was discovered, under Joas, Deuteronomy xxxi. 26., and 2 Paralipomenon xxxiv. 14. Others think that, in the days of St. Paul, the rod, &c., might have been reposited in the ark, though they had not been admitted at the time when this book was written. (Bellarmine, &c.) --- But we have no assurance that the ark was ever placed in the second temple; and Josephus informs us, that when the Romans destroyed the temple, "there was nothing at all" in the sanctuary. (Calmet) --- <i>In area</i> might easily signify <i>ad,</i> or <i>juxta arcam,</i> "near the ark." (Salien)'
      v:012:
        - '1KI:8:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Cloud.</i> He alludes to Leviticus xvi. 2. (Menochius) --- God had so frequently appeared in this manner, that Solomon was authorized to consider it as the symbol of his presence, Exodus xiv. 19., xxiv. 16., and xl. 32., and Psalm xvii. 12. This luminous cloud filled the whole temple, to convince all that the Lord was pleased with the devotion of the king, and of his people. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - "1KI:8:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Ever.</i> He seems to contrast this solid and glittering fabric with the cloud, (Menochius) as, in some sort, more worthy of God's presence. (Haydock)"
      v:014:
        - '1KI:8:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Stood.</i> It is pretended that the king alone was allowed to sit. (Calmet) --- But here Solomon stood, upon an eminence made of brass, 2 Paralipomenon vi. 13. (Haydock) --- He pronounced the blessing, (part of which is given, ver. 15-22) with his face turned towards the people, as he was also in the court of Israel. Then turning himself to the altar (Calmet) of holocausts, (Menochius) with his hands uplifted, he began to pray, ver. 23, to 54. See Exodus xxxix. 43., and 2 Kings vi. 18., where Moses and David blessed the people, on similar occasions. (Calmet) --- Thus the priests of the Catholic Church turn to the people, when they bless or speak to them; and look towards the altar, when they pour forth their supplications for them to God. Sectaries would always behold the face of the preacher. (Haydock) --- <i>Blessed.</i> Princes bless their subjects, as parents do their children. (Worthington)'
      v:015:
        - '1KI:8:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Own hands,</i> or almighty power, (Menochius) hath fulfilled his promise. (Haydock)'
      v:022:
        - '1KI:8:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Heaven,</i> falling on his knees, ver. 54., and 2 Paralipomenon vi. 13. This is the first instance we find of people praying on their knees, which was common afterwards, 1 Esdras ix. 5., Isaias xlv. 24., Daniel vi. 10., and Acts ix. 40., and xx. 36. The Christian church generally adopts this custom. So did the pagans, (<i>Et genibus pronus, supplex, similisque roganti.;</i> Metam. iii.) as they also stretched for their hands. <i>Sustulit exutas vinclis ad sidera palmas,</i> says Virgil. (Æneid ii. 153.) This practice was very general, Psalm xxvii. 2., and 1 Timothy ii. 8.'
      v:025:
        - '1KI:8:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Sight.</i> Solomon was aware of the conditions on which he held his crown and the divine favour, so that his fall is the more inexcusable. (Haydock) --- His posterity lost a great part of the kingdom, though they had the right to rule over Juda, till the coming of Christ. (Worthington)'
      v:027:
        - "1KI:8:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Earth.</i> Full of admiration, he breaks out into this pathetic exclamation, wondering that God should deign to accept of what he had done; and that, by the symbol of his presence, he should engage to honour this temple in a more particular manner, and to shower down his graces with a more liberal hand on those who should there present themselves before him.. This wise prince was not ignorant that God's immensity fills all places. --- <i>Heavens.</i> We know not how many haveans the Jews admitted. We find, <b>1.</b> the air, <b>2.</b> the region of the stars, <b>3.</b> the residence of God, thus specified; and this last is here denoted as the most excellent of all. St. Paul styles it the third heaven, 2 Corinthians xii. 2. The Basilidians counted as many heavens as there are days in the year. (St. Irenæus i. 23.)"
      v:029:
        - '1KI:8:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>My name.</i> It shall be called the house of God. (Haydock) --- There people shall come to do homage to the Lord. (Calmet)'
      v:031:
        - '1KI:8:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Oath.</i> In certain cases, an oath would clear a person, Exodus xxii. 11. Solomon prays that perjury may be disclosed. --- <i>Altar.</i> It was customary to touch the altar, when a person took an oath, as Hannibal did. K. Latinus says;{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Tango aras mediosque ignes et Numina testor---</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Nulla dies pacem hanc Italis nec fœdera rumpet.</i> (Virgil, Æneid xii. 201.)'
      v:032:
        - 1KI:8:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Justice.</i> A reward is clearly promised to good works. (Worthington)
      v:034:
        - '1KI:8:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Fathers.</i> In the place of their captivity they might turn, like Daniel, towards the temple. (Calmet) --- God had threatened that he would punish his people by the hand of their enemies, &c., if they transgressed, Leviticus xxvi. 17. (Menochius)'
      v:037:
        - '1KI:8:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Mildew.</i> Hebrew also, "a bruchus," or a young locust. Protestants, "caterpillar."'
      v:038:
        - '1KI:8:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Heart:</i> his offence. Septuagint {GREEK:START aphen}αφην{GREEK:END}, "touching, or compunction." (Haydock) --- Let a man go to the source of the evil, and be sorry for his sins. (Calmet)'
      v:039:
        - '1KI:8:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Men.</i> God cannot be imposed upon. If our heart be not moved with sorrow for our offences, including a degree of love, in vain shall we stretch forth our hands in prayer. (Calmet)'
      v:041:
        - '1KI:8:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Stranger.</i> God watches over all mankind; and oblations were received from all sorts of people, even from idolaters. The kings of Persia and Egypt, the Roman emperors, &c., made great presents, 1 Esdras iii. 7., and vii. 21. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xi., and xii. 2.) It seems the court of the <i>Gentiles</i> was only made after the captivity. Some of these adored the true God, like Cornelius, &c., Acts viii. 27., and x. 1. Some were drawn by curiosity; others desired to be converted. <i>To thee, kings shall offer presents,</i> Psalm lxxi. 10. (Calmet) --- Unbelievers are still invited to attend the chapels of the true God, that they may receive information, and deserve to obtain the blessing of faith. (Haydock)'
      v:044:
        - '1KI:8:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>Name.</i> It was the practice of the religious Jews, to pray with their eyes turned towards the holy place, ver. 48. The primitive Christians looked towards the east, in prayer, to remind them of the ascension of our Saviour, (Calmet) from Mount Olivet, in that quarter. (Haydock) (Psalm lxvii. 34.) (St. Just.[Justin Martyr?] q. 118.; Tertullian, apol. xvi.; St. Epiphanius, hær. xix.) (Calmet)'
      v:047:
        - '1KI:8:47 | 47 | 47 | <i>Heart.</i> Without <i>this,</i> external repentance will not suffice. (Worthington)'
      v:051:
        - '1KI:8:51 | 51 | 51 | <i>Iron.</i> This expression is often used to denote the rigour of the Egyptian bondage, Deuteronomy iv. 20. Thus Homer says, that Mars was shut up for thirteen months in a barrel (or prison) of brass. (Iliad E.)'
      v:059:
        - '1KI:8:59 | 59 | 59 | <i>Judgment,</i> granting his just request, and defending him against all his enemies. (Calmet)'
      v:063:
        - '1KI:8:63 | 63 | 63 | <i>Sheep,</i> and other small beasts, during the seven days, without counting the oblations of individuals. The law had not prescribed any particular rites for the dedication of places. But common sense dictated that sacred things should be distinguished from such as were common. Moses and David had set a pattern, which was followed by the Jews after the captivity, and by the Machabees, Exodus xl. 9., 1 Kings vi. 17., 1 Esdras iii. 10., and 1 Machabees iv. 56. (Calmet) --- The festival of the dedication was observed by our Saviour, John x. 22. (Haydock) --- Even private houses received a sort of dedication, Deuteronomy xx. 5. The pagans observed the like practice, with regard to statues and temples, lands and public places, Daniel iii. 1. Among the Romans, such ceremonies were performed by a general or consul, with his head covered, reciting some ancient prayers, at the suggestion of the pontiff, before a fire and an assembly of the people, called on purpose, while some person played upon the flute. (Cicero, pro Domo. Alex. Genial. vi. 14.)'
      v:064:
        - '1KI:8:64 | 64 | 64 | <i>Court</i> of the priests. An altar was there erected, in haste. Fire from heaven came to consume the victims, 2 Paralipomenon vii. 1. (Calmet)'
      v:065:
        - '1KI:8:65 | 65 | 65 | <i>Egypt.</i> Rhinocolura, (Menochius) or rather the branch of the Nile nearest to Arabia, Josue xiii. 3., and Numbers xiii. 22. (Calmet) --- <i>Seven,</i> for each festival, ver. 1.'
      v:066:
        - '1KI:8:66 | 66 | 66 | <i>Eighth day,</i> at the conclusion of the second octave. (Haydock) --- <i>Blessed the king,</i> as he had done them before. The most honourable performs this office, Hebrew vii. 7. (Calmet) --- The king and people wished all sorts of happiness to each other. --- <i>David.</i> The glory of his son reflected honour on him. (Haydock)'

      v:004: '1KI:8:4 | 4 | 4 | And carried the ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of the covenant, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, that were in the tabernacle: and the priests and the Levites carried them.'
      v:005: '1KI:8:5 | 5 | 5 | And king Solomon, and all the multitude of Israel, that were assembled unto him, went with him before the ark, and they sacrificed sheep and oxen, that could not be counted or numbered.'
      v:006: '1KI:8:6 | 6 | 6 | And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place, into the oracle of the temple, into the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubims.'
      v:007: '1KI:8:7 | 7 | 7 | For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and covered the ark, and the staves thereof above.'
      v:008: '1KI:8:8 | 8 | 8 | And whereas the staves stood out, the ends of them were seen without, in the sanctuary before the oracle, but were not seen farther out, and there they have been unto this day.'
      v:009: '1KI:8:9 | 9 | 9 | Now in the ark there was nothing else {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}but the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.'
      v:010: '1KI:8:10 | 10 | 10 | And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the sanctuary, that a cloud filled the house of the Lord,'

      v:015: '1KI:8:15 | 15 | 15 | And Solomon said: Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David, my father, and with his own hands hath accomplished it, saying:'
      v:016: '1KI:8:16 | 16 | 16 | Since the day that I brought my people Israel, out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel, for a house to be built, that my name might be there: but I chose David to be over my people Israel.'
      v:017: '1KI:8:17 | 17 | 17 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And David, my father, would have built a house to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel:'
      v:018: '1KI:8:18 | 18 | 18 | And the Lord said to David, my father: Whereas thou hast thought in thy heart to build a house to my name, thou hast done well in having this same thing in thy mind.'

      v:028: '1KI:8:28 | 28 | 28 | But have regard to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplications, O Lord, my God: hear the hymn and the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee this day:'

      v:047: '1KI:8:47 | 47 | 47 | Then if they do penance in their heart, in the place of captivity, and being converted, make supplication to thee in their captivity, saying: We have sinned, we have done unjustly, we have committed wickedness:'
      v:048: '1KI:8:48 | 48 | 48 | And return to thee with all their heart, and all their soul, in the land of their enemies, to which they had been led captives: and pray to thee towards the way of their land, which thou gavest to their fathers, and of the city which thou hast chosen, and of the temple which I have built to thy name:'

      v:053: '1KI:8:53 | 53 | 53 | For thou hast separated them to thyself for an inheritance, from amongst all the people of the earth, as thou hast spoken by Moses, thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.'
      v:054: '1KI:8:54 | 54 | 54 | And it came to pass, when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to the Lord, that he rose from before the altar of the Lord: for he had fixed both knees on the ground, and had spread his hands towards heaven.'
      v:055: '1KI:8:55 | 55 | 55 | And he stood, and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying:'
      v:056: '1KI:8:56 | 56 | 56 | Blessed be the Lord, who hath given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed so much as one word of all the good things that he promised by his servant Moses.'

      v:063: '1KI:8:63 | 63 | 63 | And Solomon slew victims of peace-offerings, which he sacrificed to the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king, and <i>all</i> the children of Israel, dedicated the temple of the Lord.'
      v:064: '1KI:8:64 | 64 | 64 | In that day the king sanctified the middle of the court, that was before the house of the Lord; for there he offered the holocaust, and sacrifice, and the fat of the peace-offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the Lord, was too little to receive the holocaust, and sacrifice, and the fat of the peace-offerings.'
      v:065: '1KI:8:65 | 65 | 65 | And Solomon made at the same time a solemn feast, and all Israel with him, a great multitude, from the entrance of Emath to the river of Egypt, before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, that is, fourteen days.'

God had spoken to Solomon, by a prophet, while he was building the temple; (chap. vi. 11.; Haydock) unless that passage relate to the same time as that which is here recorded more in detail, and took place in the night, after Solomon had poured forth his most solemn prayer. (Calmet) --- Others think that God deferred answering his petition for thirteen years, till Solomon was on the point of falling off from the observance of piety, that so he might be restrained more effectually. (Salien, the year before Christ 1011.) --- Fire from heaven had sufficiently signified that his former request had been granted. (Menochius) --- The context shews that the admonition was not sent till the palace was finished, (ver. 1, and 10.) in the 23rd year of Solomon. (Salien)'

If they indulge their passions, he will suffer these holy places to be profaned, as a dreadful warning of his displeasure. The Jews enjoyed prosperity while they continued faithful. On their revolt, the ark was taken, the temple pillaged by Sesac, burnt by Nabuchodonosor, profaned by Antiochus, and destroyed by the Romans. (Calmet)'

Solomon caused them to be rebuilt, and peopled by the Israelites. (Grotius) --- If they had formed a part of his dominions before, he would not have had to send a colony thither. (Calmet) --- Others think that he only ceded that country for a time to Hiram, till he should be indemnified. (Abulensis) (Tostat) (Menochius) (Tirinus) (Worthington) --- The country belonged to the Lord, (Leviticus xxv. 13.) and could not be given away by the prince. In case it had been occupied by strangers, Solomon would have taken care that the Israelites should have the free exercise of their religion. But as Hiram rejected his offer, he would make him recompense by some other means; (Calmet) in ready money, ver. 14. (Josephus) (Tirinus)'

Some with the last mentioned author, place these cities in the vicinity of Tyre, south of Ptolemais, which is most probable; though St. Jerome says they were in the land of Basan, beyond the Jordan.

(Haydock) --- We have seen that Adoniram was at the head of this department, chap. v. 14. The people bore these burdens with patience, till the works of <i>Mello</i> gave Jeroboam an occasion of stirring them up to rebellion, chap. xi. 27. Mello was a palace, fortification, (Calmet) or bridge, erected in the vale, (Salien) from the palace to the temple, (Menochius) lying between Sion and the old Jerusalem. David had begun to build here, and Solomon perfected the works. Ezechias repaired the wall, 2 Paralipomenon xxxii. 5. In this palace Joas was slain, 4 Kings xii. 20. (Calmet) --- <i>Heser,</i> or Asor, Josue xv. 23., and xix. 36.

Philadelphus gave his daughter Bernice to Antiochus, of Syria, with an immense dowry, which caused her to be styled <i>Phernophorus.</i> The influence of these royal wives was more extensive than that of others of meaner birth, as we find in the daughter of Pharao, Jezabel, Athalia, &c.

(Kennicott) --- Protestants have also, \"Tadmor, in the wilderness, in the land.\" (Haydock) --- Le Clerc adds, \"of Aram,\" or Syria of Soba, 2 Paralipomenon viii. 3, 4. Palmira, famous for its water and fertile soil, was the boundary of the Roman and Parthian empires, (Pliny, [Natural History?] v. 25.) surrounded on all sides by vast deserts, and built by Solomon for the advantage of travellers, a day's journey from the Euphrates. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] viii. 6.) --- Superb ruins are still to be seen, and various pagan inscriptions, in Greek. There are others in an unknown language, which might relate to the Jewish or Christian affairs. See Phil. Transac. Oct. 1695. (Brun) --- The city was destroyed by the emperor Aurelian. (Calmet)"

(Calmet) --- <i>Libanus,</i> the temple, (St. Jerome, Trad.) or the palace. (Sa) --- But these were both in Jerusalem. (Haydock) --- Solomon built a great deal at the foot of Libanus, (Salien) as the defile was of great importance. We read of the <i>tower of Libanus,</i> Canticle of Canticles vii. 4.

(Haydock) --- Esdras (1 Esdras ii. 58.) calls them who returned from captivity, <i>the children of the servants of Solomon,</i> 392.

Huet fixes upon Sophola, on the eastern coast of Africa; and supposes that the fleet of Hiram might proceed down a canal, which seems to have been formerly opened for a communication between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. (Strabo i. 17., and ii.) (Du Hamel) --- The various commodities might be procured either in Africa, or, on the voyage, in other countries.

The Abyssinians also pretend that their kings are descendants of Solomon, by the queen of Saba; and that Azarias, the son of Sadoc, stole the tables of the law, when he brought back his pupil from Jerusalem. (Sanctius) --- This shews their vanity and ignorance. (Calmet) --- Still many suppose that this queen came from their country. (Worthington, &c.) --- <i>Lord,</i> who had raised Solomon to so great splendour, while, on the other hand, the king endeavoured to enhance his glory. (Haydock) --- If we place the stop after Solomon, we may say that the queen was moved by divine grace, and attracted, like the Gabaonites, (Josue ix. 9.) to embrace the true religion; (Calmet) though she seems to have professed it already, as many others did among the Gentiles. (Haydock) --- The Fathers look upon her as a figure of the Christian Church. (St. Hilary, Psalm cxxi.; St. Irenæus iv. 45., &c.) <i>Barbara natione, non animo.</i> (St. Paulin, ep. 1.) --- <i>Questions.</i> Thus the ancients tried each others skill, Judges xiv. 12.

(Haydock) --- One word might be the Ethiopian pronunciation. (Huet) --- Yet Kimchi observes, that such transpositions of letters are very common among the Hebrews. (Du Hamel) --- Solomon had desired Hiram to send him some algum, or "gum bearing" wood: but as there was not sufficient, or so fine, in Libanus as in Ophir, or in foreign parts, he procured more from those countries. The wood might probably resemble that of <i>settim,</i> or of black acacia, (Exodus xxv. 5.) whence the gum of Arabia is extracted. Acanthos, in Thebais, was celebrated for its fine thorn-trees, and for its gum. (Strabo xvii.) (Calmet) --- It is placed near Memphis. (Pliny, [Natural History?] iv 10.) --- The Rabbins commonly understand the Hebrew to mean, "coral," which is not fit for instruments, much less for architecture. Others translate ebony, or Brazil wood, but without reason. (Calmet) (Tirinus)'

These targets or shields, seem to have been heavier than the former, and designed only for ornament, being placed in the great hall, as they weighed each 375 Roman pounds, or 18,000 sicles; (Calmet) unless <i>minæ,</i> pound, be here put for sicle; as Josephus ([Antiquities?] ii. 3.) says that sons of Jacob sold their brother for twenty pieces of silver, Genesis xxxvii. 28.

This was the country whence it was brought; (Jeremias x. 9.) probably Colchis, where the river Phasis, or <i>Phison,</i> flows, Genesis ii. 11.

Josephus ([Antiquities?] viii. 5.) represents them as forming the seat: (Calmet) and the Septuagint place them on each side: "the fore-parts of oxen, projecting from the back of the throne, and hands on the throne, on each side of the seat."

(Menochius) --- But when it signifies some particular place, (Haydock) it probably refers to Tarsus of Cilicia, which was once the most famous mart on the Mediterranean, though not perhaps in the days of Solomon, but after it had been embellished by the Assyrian kings. "Ships of Tharsis," often denote such as were fit for a long voyage; and of this description were the fleets of Solomon and of Hiram, which sailed from Asiongaber to Ophir, and touched at various ports, where they procured what they wanted. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "the king had at sea a navy of Tharsis....once in three years: the navy of Tharsis came, bringing gold," &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Teeth.</i> Hebrew <i>Shenhabim.</i> The latter word is commonly rendered elephants, <i>k</i> being lost at the beginning. (Bochart) --- Syriac and Arabic intimate, that the elephants were brought alive. Perhaps <i>n</i> may be dropped after <i>b;</i> so that we should read, <i>ebnim,</i> as [in] Ezechiel xxvii. 15., and translate ivory and <i>ebony;</i> the one being remarkable for its white, and the other for is black colour. Both might be procured on the coasts of Ethiopia, by which the fleet passed. The Persians, and Sesostris, required the people of the country to pay both for tribute. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xii. 14.; Diodorus i.) --- <i>Apes.</i> Hebrew <i>Kophim.</i> Greek, {GREEK:START Kepos}Κηποσ{GREEK:END}. There was a peculiar species in Ethiopia, which the Egyptians adored at Babylon, near Memphis, and was exhibited by Julius Cæsar, in the public shews. (Solin.; Bochart) --- <i>Peacocks</i> is not expressed in the Septuagint. (Calmet) --- The Roman edition, instead of <i>elephants,</i> &c., inserts, "stones" &c., intended for the various edifices and towns, which Solomon fortified, to keep under the nations of Chanaan, whom he forced to labour, &c. But the Alexandrian copy has, {GREEK:START taonon}ταονον{GREEK:END}, "peacocks," as <i>thuciim</i> is rendered (Haydock) by the Chaldean, Syriac, &c. (Calmet) --- Huet observes, that these birds were scarcely known in the time of Alexander, and would therefore understand , <i>psittacos,</i> "parrots." (Du Hamel) --- But peacocks were called, "birds of Media," as they were very common in that country, (Calmet) and about Babylon. (Diodorus ii.) --- The fleet of Solomon might advance as far as the confines of Media. Josephus adds, that it brought home Ethiopian slaves, who were in high esteem in a country where eunuchs were employed to guard the women, (Calmet) as there would be less danger of too great familiarity.

        - "1KI:11:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Strange women,</i> who had been brought up in the service of idols, and were not sincerely converted. (Haydock) --- Riches engaged Solomon in the love of pleasure, and this brought on his ruin. (Calmet) --- He began with the spirit, but ended in the flesh, Galatians iii. 3., and Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 21. He was aware of the dangerous conversation of women, Ecclesiasticus xix. 2. Yet he has left us in his own person an example of that dreadful truth, that it is difficult to love with discretion. (Haydock) --- <i>Amare et sapere vix cuiquam conceditur.</i> Nothing could be more beautiful than the commencement of his reign, nor more terrible than the latter part of it. <i>Thou hast stained thy glory,</i> &c., Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 22. Hence we may apply to him, <i>How are thou fallen from heaven?</i> (Isaias xiv. 12.) (Calmet) --- <i>Pharao.</i> This marriage seems to be blamed, as the source of Solomon's misfortunes; though it is probable, that she had pretended to embrace his religion. (Menochius) (Salien) --- He ought to have repudiated her as soon as she relapsed. (Tirinus)"
      v:002:
        - '1KI:11:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Gods.</i> See Exodus xxxiv. 16., and Deuteronomy vii. 4. The law only forbids expressly the marrying of the women of Chanaan. But it was easy to discern, that the spirit of the law equally prohibited connexions with others who were addicted to idol-worship. See 1 Esdras x. 3. Such alliances are always dangerous, and generally prove fatal; (Calmet) unless there be good reason to believe that the parties are sincerely converted: in which case the prohibition ceases. (Haydock) --- <i>Love.</i> Thus, <i>nitimur in vetitum semper, cupimusque negata;</i> and, <i>stolen waters are sweeter,</i> says impure love; but <i>her guests are in the depths of hell,</i> Proverbs ix. 17, 18.'

        - '1KI:11:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Concubines,</i> or secondary wives. (Haydock) --- Those who have any sense of modesty, can hardly read this without blushing. (Salien) --- Solomon was guilty not only of intemperance, but also of a transgression of the precept. (Menochius) (Deuteronomy xvii. 17.) --- <i>He shall not have many wives:</i> though as that command is indefinite, and David had eighteen, without blame, (2 Kings iii. 3.) it is difficult to say how many a person might have, at that time, without exceeding the bounds of moderation. (Haydock) --- But a thousand wives for one man, is certainly too great a number. When Solomon wrote the Canticles, he had only sixty queens and eighty concubines, Canticle of Canticles vi. 8. The Rabbins allow the king eighteen wives. But it is probable that most of the kings indulged themselves in a greater latitude. Darius, of Persia, took along with him to the wars 350 concubines, when he was overcome by Alexander. (Atheneus xiii. 1.) Priam had also many wives, besides Hecuba, the <i>queen.</i> The inferior wives looked upon those who had this title with a degree of respect, bordering on adoration. (Calmet)'

(Haydock) --- <i>Heart,</i> and <i>mind</i> also, ver. 9. He sacrificed to idols, not only externally, but gave them internal worship; (Salien) so much was his understanding darkened, unless (Haydock) he acted against his better knowledge, Ecclesiastes ii. 9. (Tirinus) --- <i>Father</i> who did not continue long in sin. (Du Hamel) --- "The wisdom, which had been given to him, entirely abandoned his heart, which the discipline even of the smallest tribulation had not guarded." (St. Gregory, Pastoral. p. 3.) --- "He had commenced his reign with an ardent desire of wisdom, and when he had obtained it by spiritual love, he lost it by carnal affections." (St. Augustine, Doct. iii. 21.) --- "Prosperity, which is a severe trial for the wise, was more disadvantageous to him than wisdom herself had been profitable." (St. Augustine, City of God xvii. 20.) --- The Fathers do not attempt to palliate the guilt of Solomon; and those aggravate his crime, who endeavour to excuse him by saying, that his mind was still convinced that there could be but one God, and that his adoration of idols was merely external, and out of complaisance to his wives. See Santius,&c. (Calmet)'

(Calmet) --- Yet no place was consecrated to idols within the city. (Menochius) --- The idols of Egypt are not specified, though the daughter of Pharao would, probably, interest herself in their favour. The Jews were more prone to those of Chanaan. We find, however, that they were addicted to the worship of Adonis, who was highly revered in Egypt; (Ezechiel viii. 14.; Calmet) and the golden calves were an imitation of Apis.

(Abulensis) --- God was not content with giving him the general commandments: he had condescended to caution him in a most particular and earnest manner: (Haydock) so that his transgression is more horrible and ungrateful.

        - '1KI:11:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Sake.</i> As David placed this son upon the throne, the disgrace would seem to revert on him. (Menochius) --- Here we behold the reward of piety, and how desirable a thing it is to have saints for our parents. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - '1KI:11:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>One tribe.</i> Besides that of Juda, his own native tribe. (Challoner) --- That of Benjamin had been so reduced, that it scarcely deserved the name of a tribe. It was also invariably connected with the adjoining tribe of Juda; as many of the other tribes, after the captivities of Assyria and Babylon, went by the common title of Jews. (Tirinus) --- The Levites, and many of the Israelites, came to inhabit in the land of Juda, for the sake of the true religion, chap. xii. 17., and 2 Paralipomenon xi. 13, 16. Jeroboam banished the tribe of Levi from his dominions, that he might more easily introduce a change of religion among his subjects. The two kingdoms were thus almost equal in strength. (Calmet) --- <i>Chosen</i> for the abode of holiness, and the seat of government. (Salien) --- <i>One tribe....and Jerusalem;</i> which latter may denote the tribe of Benjamin. (Worthington)'
      v:014:
        - '1KI:11:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Adversary.</i> Hebrew <i>Satan.</i> Nothing of this kind could molest him, while he continued faithful, chap. v. 4. But now he sees the arm of God stretched out, pressing him to repent. --- <i>Adad.</i> Septuagint <i>Ader.</i> Josephus says that this prince solicited Pharao to let him return into his own country, after the death of Joab: but was prevailed upon to desist from the attempt, till the affairs of Solomon began to decline. He then endeavoured to get possession of the country; but, being repelled by the strong garrisons of the Hebrews, he went and joined Razar, (Hebrew <i>Razon</i>) who had revolted against Aderezer; and made inroads into the dominions of Solomon consented, at the entreaty of Pharao, that Adad should reign over Idumea, on his paying tribute; and that the latter attempted to throw off the yoke. (Salien) --- But these particulars are uncertain, and Idumea was subject to the kings of Juda till the days of Joram, 2 Paralipomenon xxi. 8. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - '1KI:11:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>In Edom,</i> in the 15th year of his reign. (Salien) --- Abisai was the general in this expedition, 2 Kings viii., and 1 Paralipomenon xviii. 12.'

        - '1KI:11:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Full.</i> Septuagint, "elder sister of his wife Thekemina." (Haydock)'
      v:023:
        - 1KI:11:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Razon.</i> He must have been now about 94 years old; unless this was the son of Aderezer's general. (Salien) (Menochius)
      v:024:
        - "1KI:11:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Robbers,</i> or (Hebrew and Septuagint) \"a band\" with whom he made depredations. (Haydock) --- <i>Damascus,</i> with David's consent, on their admitting a garrison, (2 Kings viii. 6,) and consenting to pay tribute; (Menochius) or Razon might make himself master of this place, only after the apostacy of Solomon. His successors became very formidable to the Jews, particularly Razin, (4 Kings xv., and xvi.) who was slain by Theglathphalassar, 4 Kings v. 9. (Calmet)"
      v:025:
        - '1KI:11:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Solomon,</i> after he once began. (Haydock) --- <i>Adad.</i> Hebrew, "and with the evil of Adad, and he detested Israel." (Menochius) --- Razon and Adad conspired to attack Solomon. (Haydock) --- Adad may be the common name of the kings of Damascus. Some copies of the Septuagint do not speak of Razon, but continue the history of Adad, ver. 14. They also read <i>Edom</i> here instead of <i>Aram,</i> or <i>Syria,</i> which would remove the confusion. (Calmet) --- Adad, Razon, and Jeroboam always oppugn Solomon after his fall; and signify the flesh, the world, and the devil. (Worthington)'
      v:026:
        - '1KI:11:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>King,</i> attempting to draw the people into rebellion, as he perceived that they were discontent with the buildings at Mello. He had a command over them; and though he was, for the present, obliged to save himself by flight, he had sown the seeds of rebellion by his discourses, in such a manner, that the imprudent answer of Roboam (Calmet) easily brought them to maturity. (Haydock)'
      v:028:
        - "1KI:11:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Joseph,</i> Ephraim and Manasses. (Menochius) --- He was of the former tribe. (Salien) --- At first Solomon employed none of the Israelites to work, chap. ix. 22. But he afterwards oppressed them grievously. The king's <i>right</i> was to make his subjects cultivate his lands, &c., 1 Kings viii. 11. They did not pay money, (Matthew xvii. 24,) but wrought for the king. Hebrew, \"he made him ruler over all the charge,\" (or levy.) (Haydock) --- The Vulgate often uses the word tribute (Calmet) for <i>sebel.</i> Josephus believes that Jeroboam had the command over the forces of the house of Joseph: but he had rather the superintendency over the workmen. (Haydock)"
      v:029:
        - '1KI:11:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Garment. Salma</i> occurs 16 times in this sense, and <i>simlee</i> 27. The latter, we may presume, is the true reading, as it is in the Samaritan Pentateuch invariably; Exodus xxii. 26, 27, both words are printed in the Hebrew Bible. But it is not probable that Moses should have written them so; no more than a Latin author would use both <i>vestinentum</i> and <i>vestimentum. Shamal,</i> in Arabic, signifies "he clothed himself all over." (Kennicott) --- <i>Way</i> leading to Ephraim, (Menochius) his department. (Calmet) --- <i>Field.</i> Septuagint, "he drew him aside out of the road: and Ahias had on a new cloak, and both were in the field." (Haydock) --- Jeroboam would not probably go unattended; (Menochius) and it seems this transaction soon transpired, and came to the ears of Solomon. (Haydock)'
      v:030:
        - '1KI:11:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Parts.</i> He speaks by his actions, (Menochius) thus foretelling what should happen, as was customary with the prophets, Osee i. 2., Jeremias xxvii. 2., Ezechiel xii. 7., and Acts xxi. 11. (Calmet) --- This tended to make a deeper impression on the mind, (Haydock) and convince all, that what was spoken, was not in jest. (Worthington)'
      v:034:
        - '1KI:11:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Make,</i> or permit him to reign. (Menochius)'
      v:036:
        - '1KI:11:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>A lamp.</i> Posterity, (2 Kings xxi. 17.) power, and glory, 4 Kings viii. 19.'
      v:037:
        - 1KI:11:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Desireth.</i> It seems he was already disposed to revolt. (Calmet)
      v:038:
        - '1KI:11:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Faithful house,</i> which shall not be destroyed, nor lose the kingdom, for a long time. Jeroboam never complied with the condition. (Calmet)'
      v:039:
        - '1KI:11:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>For this</i> infidelity of Solomon, (Haydock) <i>afflict,</i> by raising up a rival. (Menochius) --- <i>For ever.</i> Notwithstanding the wickedness of many of its princes, this family was to subsist, in a distinguished rank, till the coming of the Messias; that the completion of the promises might be more observable. (Calmet) --- After 250 years, the throne of Israel was subverted. (Menochius)'
      v:040:
        - '1KI:11:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Therefore,</i> being apprized of what had passed, as well as to prevent the farther attempts of Jeroboam. (Haydock) --- <i>Sesac.</i> He is the first, whose proper name is given in Scripture. Whether he was of the same family, as the Pharao, whose daughter Solomon had married, cannot be ascertained. Marsham makes Sesac the same with the renowned Sesostris, the Sethosis of Manetho. But Usher thinks that Sesostris reigned immediately after the Israelites left Egypt; while Pezron, &c., suppose that Amenoplis, who was drowned, was even his grandson. (Calmet)'
      v:041:
        - '1KI:11:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Words,</i> or transactions. (Haydock) --- <i>Book.</i> This book is lost, with divers others mentioned in holy writ. (Challoner) --- Nathan, Ahias, and Addo, composed these journals, 2 Paralipomenon ix. 29. (Haydock) --- Similar works were kept at the courts of Persia and of Babylon, Esther vi. 1., and 1 Esdras vi. 2. Plutarch quotes the journal of Alexander; and Tacitus (An. iii.) informs us, that the smallest occurrences were specified in journals, at Rome, while things of greater importance were recorded in the annals. <i>The books of days,</i> are cited in the Paralipomenon, so that we cannot suppose that these journals are the same with that work. (Calmet) --- God was pleased that those writings should not come down to us; so that we can only speak from conjecture of the repentance of Solomon. (Salien, the year of the world 3058.)'
      v:042:
        - '1KI:11:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>Forty.</i> Josephus says eighty; and some suppose, that the Scripture only specifies the years during which Solomon reigned virtuously. Pezron is of the same opinion as Josephus. (Haydock) --- Others contend that it is a manifest mistake. Immoderate pleasures hastened his old age and death, when he was about fifty-eight years old. All in him was great, whether we consider the virtues of his early days, or the vices of his old age. He falls from heaven into the abyss. His repentance is a problem. (Calmet)'
      v:043:
        - "1KI:11:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Solomon slept,</i> &c. That is, died. He was then about fifty-eight years of age, having reigned forty years. (Challoner) --- St. Chrysostom, at different times, seems to have entertained opposite opinions on this head, (Haydock) which has been a matter of controversy among the Fathers, as it is at present with us. We ought to adore and imitate, with trembling, the silence of Scripture. (Calmet) --- Septuagint seem favourable to Solomon: (Proverbs xxiv. 32.) \"At last I did penance, and looked forward, to embrace discipline.\" (Haydock) --- But the Hebrew, Chaldean, and Vulgate have nothing similar. (Calmet) --- Some think that the Book of Proverbs, as well as that of Ecclesiastes, was composed by him after his repentance; and that he expresses his sentiments of affliction and self-condemnation, (Proverbs xxx. 2.) and his opinion of all earthly gratifications, Ecclesiastes i. 2., &c. (Haydock) --- Yet this dreadful uncertainty may serve to keep us all in humble fear, and teach us to work out our salvation with trembling. (Calmet) --- If Solomon really repented, (Haydock) he might not have time or power to remove all the vestiges, and the very foundations of the idolatrous temples, which Ezechias also neglected in ruins, as no longer dangerous, and as so many monuments of the folly of Solomon. But Josias caused them to be entirely removed, 4 Kings xxiii. 13. (Salien, the year of the world 3059.) The daughter of Pharao would probably imitate her beloved husband. (Pineda) --- Sadoc seems to have departed this life about the same time with Solomon; as his son Achimaas, who had married Basemath, the king's daughter, succeeded him in the pontificate, at the commencement of Roboam's reign. (Chron. Min. Heb. Salien)"

      v:004: '1KI:11:4 | 4 | 4 | And when he was now old, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}his heart was turned away by women to follow strange gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David, his father.'

      v:010: '1KI:11:10 | 10 | 10 | And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not follow strange gods: but he kept not the things which the Lord commanded him.'
      v:011: '1KI:11:11 | 11 | 11 | The Lord therefore said to Solomon: Because thou hast done this, and hast not kept my covenant, and my precepts, which I have commanded thee, I will divide and rend thy kingdom, and will give it to thy servant.'

      v:019: '1KI:11:19 | 19 | 19 | And Adad found great favour before Pharao, insomuch that he gave him to wife the own sister of his wife, Taphnes, the queen.'

        - '1KI:12:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Him.</i> They were young, compared with the former, though they might be 40 years old. (Menochius) --- It was frequently the custom in the eastern courts, to educate young noblemen along with the heir to the crown. Such formed the captains of Alexander, (1 Machabees i. 7,) and the warriors of Sesostris, whose father ordered all the male children who were born on the same day in his dominions, to be brought to court, to be educated with his son. (Diodorus i.) --- The Persian nobility were brought up at the gate of the prince, that they might learn temperance and the art of governing. (Xenophon, Cyrop. i.) --- The endeavours of Solomon were frustrated by the evil disposition of his son, and of those about his person.'
      v:010:
        - "1KI:12:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Finger</i> is not expressed in Hebrew or Septuagint, but the Syriac and Josephus agree with the Vulgate. In Paralipomenon, we read <i>loins,</i> instead of <i>back.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, my little (Protestants supply <i>finger</i>). Septuagint, \"my littleness,\" {GREEK:START mikrotes}μικροτησ{GREEK:END}; but in Paralipomenon <i>finger</i> is added. (Haydock) --- Chaldean, \"my weakness is stronger than my father's strength.\" The loins denote strength. Roboam did not use these boastings and insolent expressions: but he adopted their spirit. (Calmet) --- He insinuates that he was twice as old as his father when he began to reign, (Pineda vii. 24,) or he uses a proverbial exaggeration. (Delrio. adag. 202.) (Menochius)"
      v:011:
        - '1KI:12:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Scorpions.</i> Chaldean, "thorns." Hebrew has both significations. Like a tyrant, Roboam threatens to beat the people with sharp thorns. (Menochius)'
      v:015:
        - '1KI:12:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Turned.</i> Hebrew, "for the cause (revolution) was from the Lord, (Calmet) that he might verify his word." (Haydock) --- God permitted the king to act impudently, and disposed things in such a manner, that the prediction took effect. (Calmet) --- Indeed, the prophet had only spoken, because things would happen. (Haydock) --- "There are two sorts of persecutors, those who blame, and those who flatter: the tongue of the flatterer persecutes more than the hand of him who kills." (St. Augustine in Psalm lxix.) (Du Hamel) --- Roboam fell a prey to his evil counsellors. (Haydock) --- <i>That,</i> (ver. 16.) denotes the sequel, not the final cause, as chap. xiv. 9. (Worthington)'
      v:016:
        - "1KI:12:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Look to.</i> Chaldean, \"rule over thy own tribe.\" They imitate those who give a bill of divorce. (Calmet) --- Herein they were not excusable, no more than those who persecuted God's people, though he permitted their wickedness, to chastise the guilty. (Menochius) --- Seba had formerly withdrawn the people from David in the same manner, 2 Kings xx. 1. (Haydock) --- Abulensis thinks that as God had chosen Jeroboam, and his rival acted tryannically, the people did right. (Tirinus)"
      v:017:
        - '1KI:12:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Them,</i> as well as over many, who came into his territory, that they might practise the true religion, without restraint. (Haydock) (Chap. xi. 13.) --- The kings of Juda afterwards made various conquests, chap. xiii. 19. Hence they were able to contend with the other tribes (Calmet) with advantage. (Haydock) --- Even at first, Roboam put himself at the head of 180,000 chosen men, ver. 21. Abia had an army of 400,000, and Asa near 600,000; while Josaphat had 1,160,000 soldiers, 2 Paralipomenon xiii. 3., and xiv. 8., and xvii. 14.'
      v:018:
        - '1KI:12:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Aduram.</i> One of the same name had occupied this post under David, 2 Kings xx. 24. (Calmet) --- Some suppose that this is the same with <i>Adoniram,</i> chap. iv. 6. Roboam impudently sent him to appease the people, (Salien) or haughtily to demand the usual tribute; unless the king abandoned him to the fury of the populace, as an object of their horror. The people have often been appeased by the death of rapacious ministers. --- <i>Haste.</i> Hebrew, "he strengthened himself," or obstinately persisted in his resolution of reducing the people by force; and thus those, who might now have been easily reclaimed, were driven to choose another king, and the evil became irremediable. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - "1KI:12:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Again,</i> from Egypt, ver. 2. (Haydock) --- He had not been present, it seems, at the second assembly; or, at least, he had retired as soon as Roboam had given his decision. But the people having stoned Aduram, and thus rendered a reconciliation very difficult, Jeroboam was invited to accept the crown. (Calmet) --- As this was conformable to his utmost desires and the prophet's declaration, he made no demur, chap. xi. 37. (Haydock) <i>Only.</i> Benjamin was a small tribe, and so intermixed with the tribe of Juda, (the very city of Jerusalem being partly in Juda, partly in Benjamin) that they are here counted but as one tribe. (Challoner) --- Perhaps <i>Benjamin</i> at first hesitated; but, considering the greater danger to which it would be exposed, embraced the party of Roboam, ver. 21. (Salien)"
      v:021:
        - '1KI:12:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Fourscore.</i>[Eighty.] Septuagint, "twenty." (Du Hamel) --- But the Alexandrian copy agrees with the Hebrew. (Haydock)'
      v:024:
        - '1KI:12:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Them.</i> This shews the great authority of Semeias. He wrote the history of Roboam, 2 Paralipomenon xii. 15. He also foretold the irruption of Sesac, to punish the house of Israel; but not to destroy it. (Calmet) --- The obedience of Roboam deserves applause; though it would have been a vain attempt to resist God, who was resolved to punish his family. (Menochius) --- God must have touched the hearts of the leaders, to convince them that he spoke by the mouth of Semeias. (Salien) --- The Vatican Septuagint here subjoins almost the whole history of Jeroboam, improperly. (Haydock) See chap. xiv.'
      v:025:
        - '1KI:12:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Built,</i> or "had built," while Roboam was preparing for his invasion. (Salien) --- <i>Sichem</i> and <i>Phanuel</i> had been ruined by Abimelech, and by Gedeon, Judges viii. 17., and ix. 45. (Calmet) --- By means of these fortresses, he secured both sides of the Jordan. (Haydock) --- Jeroboam afterwards fixed his residence at Thirsa, where the court was kept, till Amri built Samaria.'
      v:027:
        - '1KI:12:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Him.</i> Jeroboam chose to follow the dictates of human policy, rather than to depend on the express declaration of God, who had given him the kingdom. It was natural that the people should have a predilection for the house of David; (Calmet) and he might fear that the priests would prevail upon them to return to their old master, as they dwelt about Jerusalem. (Salien)'
      v:028:
        - '1KI:12:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Device.</i> Wicked policy, to make religion subservient to the state. (Worthington) --- Jeroboam was right in judging, (Haydock) that it is one of the strongest foundations of government, (Calmet) and therefore he would have a peculiar religion for his subjects. (Haydock) --- Strange blindness, caused by ambition! As if God could not have maintained him on the throne. The sequel evinces how delusive were his wicked projects. (Calmet) --- <i>Calves.</i> It is likely, by making his gods in this form, he mimicked the Egyptians, among whom he had sojourned, who worshipped their Apis and their Osiris under the form of a bullock. (Challoner) (St. Jerome in Osee iv. 15., and v., &c.) --- The Greeks commonly style these idols, <i>heifers,</i> as more contemptible than bulls: (Tirinus) and some Fathers style them, "calf-heads." (Lactantius iv. 10.) Monceau pretends that they resembled the cherubim, and were intended to represent the true God; thus endeavouring to excuse the Israelites from idolatry, on this occasion, as well as when they came out of Egypt, Exodus xxxii. 4. But his arguments are weak, and Jeroboam is constantly condemned as a most wicked and idolatrous prince, chap. xiv. 9., 4 Kings xxiii. 15., and Osee viii. 5., and x. 5. (Calmet) --- <i>Egypt.</i> The same had been said by Aaron. (Menochius)'
      v:029:
        - '1KI:12:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Bethel and Dan.</i> Bethel was a city of the tribe of Ephraim, in the southern parts of the dominions of Jeroboam, about six leagues from Jerusalem: Dan was in the extremity of his dominions, to the north, on the confines of Syria. (Challoner) --- The Israelites did not hesitate to travel so far, ver. 30. (Calmet) --- Those who lived nearer Bethel, went thither along with their king. (Salien) --- The latter city was assigned to Benjamin, Josue xviii. 22. (Menochius) --- But probably many of the subjects of Jeroboam dwelt in it; so that it was the most southern city of his dominions. It had been consecrated by Jacob, (Genesis xxviii. 19.) and was a famous place of devotion, 1 Kings x. 3. Septuagint (Alexandrian) and St. Cyril (in Osee, p. 5.) read Galgal. Dan had been long before infected with idolatry, Judges xviii. 30.'
      v:030:
        - '1KI:12:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Sin,</i> almost irreparable, which brought on the ruin of the ten tribes. Though the calves were taken away along with them into captivity, the people did not return to the service of the Lord: but the greatest part imitated the conduct of the pagans, with whom they mixed; while some few returned with the tribe of Juda, and made a part of that kingdom. The Samaritans, who were sent to inhabit their country, were not of the race of Jacob. (Calmet)'
      v:031:
        - '1KI:12:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Places,</i> to other idols or <i>devils,</i> (2 Paralipomenon xi. 15.; Haydock) not merely at Bethel, chap. xiii. --- <i>Lowest.</i> Such places were fittest for him. (Worthington) --- Hebrew, "extremity:" others understand people of reputation: but it seems he took any <i>whosoever would</i> (chap. xiii. 33.) accept the office, without confining himself to the Levites. (Calmet) --- Indeed most of them were banished, as refractory; (2 Paralipomenon xi. 13.) though some were so weak as to take part with him; (Ezechiel xliv. 10.) probably the descendants of Micha, Judges xviii. 31. (Haydock) --- They were not punished with instant death, like Core, though their crime seemed greater. (Salien)'
      v:032:
        - '1KI:12:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Day.</i> God had prescribed the seventh month, (Calmet) and this wicked prince purposely made choice of another, that the observance of the days appointed might be obliterated. Thus the Jacobins, in France, decreed that the tenth day should be the day of rest, instead of Sunday. (Haydock) --- Religious assemblies tend greatly to promote the spirit of concord and peace.'
      v:033:
        - '1KI:12:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>To:</i> literally, "up on," (<i>super</i>) as at the end of the verse. (Haydock) --- The altars were very high and large. (Calmet) --- <i>Month.</i> Septuagint add, "on the festival which," &c. (Menochius) --- <i>Heart.</i> Hebrew reads <i>millibod,</i> (<i>præter</i>) instead of <i>molbu,</i> (<i>ex corde suo.</i>) Some manuscripts retain the latter word, as it is printed also in the marginal keri. Leusden tells us, we are by no means to say it is the truer reading, because then the text must be allowed to be corrupted; but it only explains what is meant by <i>præter,</i> "besides." A marvellous explanation! and perhaps it is only to be paralleled by <i>ei</i> explained by <i>non.</i> (Kennicott) --- Jeroboam has a mind to do honour to his new worship, and unites in his own person the sacerdotal and regal dignity, as the Roman emperors did. (Calmet) --- <i>Incense.</i> Septuagint, "to sacrifice." (Haydock) --- From this period, many learned men date the 390 years of the iniquity of Israel, Ezechiel iv. 5. (Du Hamel)'

      v:016: '1KI:12:16 | 16 | 16 | Then the people, seeing that the king would not hearken to them, answered him, saying : What portion have we in David? or what inheritance in the son of Isai?

      v:021: '1KI:12:21 | 21 | 21 | And Roboam came to Jerusalem, and gathered together all the house of Juda, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred fourscore thousand chosen men for war, to fight against the house of Israel, and to bring the kingdom again under Roboam, the son of Solomon.'

(Salien) --- This prediction proves the truth of the religion; for, though the author of this book might have seen it verified, yet he would undoubtedly insert the very words of the prophet, which were known to all the people, 4 Kings xxiii. 15. In this passage we do not read that Josias destroyed the <i>priests.</i> But ver. 19., and 20., it is clearly insinuated. (Calmet) --- <i>Who now.</i> He will reduce their bones to ashes upon this altar; or, those who shall imitate these priests, shall be <i>there</i> burnt alive. (Haydock)'

Pharao, Saul, and Achaz beheld them in vain: only one of the ten lepers returned to give thanks, Luke xvii. 17. This miracle rendered Jeroboam still more inexcusable. (Calmet)'

This old man of Bethel was indeed a prophet, but he sinned in thus deceiving the man of God; the more, because he pretended a revelation for what he did; (Challoner; Worthington) though he did it with a good intention, and supposed that the prophet had only been forbidden to eat with Jeroboam and his followers. (Theodoret, q. 42.) --- This lie might cause him to be styled, "a false prophet," by Josephus. Abulensis thinks he was a wicked man, like Balaam; and many suppose that he was the chief instrument in deluding the king. (Josephus; St. Gregory, &c.) --- After the man of God had been torn to pieces, he might easily persuade the people that he was only an impostor, and that the pretended miracles were merely the effects of natural causes. It is not certain that this man was inspired by God, ver. 20. --- <i>Deceived.</i> Hebrew, "he lied unto him, (Calmet) and thus caused him to transgress. (Worthington)'

For the generality of divines[theologians] are of opinion, that the sin of this prophet, considered with all its circumstances, was not mortal. (Challoner) --- He had received a positive order, and ought to have tried <i>the spirits,</i> whether they were from God, 1 John iv. 1., and Galatians vi. 18. Every prophecy which contradicts the word of God, comes from an evil principle. (Calmet) --- The prophet might suppose, however, that some cause had intervened, which authorized him to eat with this his brother, (ver. 30.) whom he probably revered as a true prophet. Many of God's commands are conditional. (Haydock) --- Serenus observes, that God often inflicts death for the smallest faults. (Cassian vii. 26.) (St. Gregory, Dial. iv. 24.) --- St. Augustine (cura, c. 7.) doubts not of the prophet's salvation. --- <i>Body,</i> without even hurting the ass, ver. 28. (Haydock) --- God protected the relics of his servant, by stationing the lion for a guard. (Procopius) (Menochius) --- How impenetrable are the counsels of God! He suffers Jeroboam, and the prophet who had seduced his servant, to live; while he punishes the latter for a fault which he had committed undesignedly. But he thus purified him from guilt, (Calmet) while he reserved Jeroboam for more lasting torments in another world. (Haydock) --- Nothing could prove more forcibly the existence of future rewards and punishments. (Calmet) --- Not only the deceiver, but he also who is deceived, so as to transgress God's orders, must be punished. (Worthington)"

But the sacred writer speaks of places by the names which they bore in his time. (Calmet) --- If this man was a prophet, he might easily mention <i>Samaria,</i> which would give its name to the kingdom of Israel. There was also probably a village of this name long before, on the mountain <i>Samir,</i> where one of the judges was buried, Judges x. 2. (Haydock)'

The Vatican copy gives a great part, with some circumstances which occur no where else, chap. xii. 24. (Calmet) --- The wife of Jeroboam is there called Ano, (Menochius) the elder sister of the queen of Egypt, Thekemina. See chap. xi. 19; where Adad marries another sister. (Haydock) --- <i>Time.</i> This expression does not determine the year. (St. Chrysostom, &c.) --- The passage in the Vatican Septuagint seems to place this death before Jeroboam ascended the throne: but it took place rather at the end of his reign, ver. 14. Abia seems to have been his eldest son, and fit for command; so that the people mourn for him, which they would hardly have done for an infant. (Calmet)"
      v:002:

Jeroboam was aware that he would be full of indignation at the changes which had been introduced. He might also fear, lest his wife might be exposed to danger in (Calmet) or near (Haydock) the enemy's country, (Calmet) and the people would have been more convinced of the vanity of their idols, if they had seen that it was necessary to have recourse to a prophet of the true God. (Menochius) --- The mother might ask without the least suspicion, \"Will my son recover?\" --- <i>Silo</i> might still be attached to the service of God, in consequence of the ark residing there so long, and the presence of the revered Ahias; so that, if it formed a part of the dominions of Israel, (Tirinus) as it was in the tribe of Ephraim, though nearer Jerusalem than Sichem, (Calmet) Jeroboam might reasonably fear lest his wife should be treated with indignity.

Arabic, "fruits." Syriac adds "dried." It was customary to make presents to the prophets, 1 Kings ix. 7. (Calmet) --- But these were mean, that the woman might not be known.

(Menochius) --- <i>Clean.</i> This family is compared to something most disgusting, (Haydock) because it had introduced idolatry, and the prediction against it was literally fulfilled by Baasa, (chap. xv. 29.; Tirinus) \"as the vintner seeks in the vineyard even for the last grape.\" (Syriac and Arabic)"

        - "1KI:14:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Time.</i> Protestants, \"But what? even now.\" The young prince, (Haydock) who was the firmest support of the family, was presently hurried away. Abia, king of Juda, slew above 500,000 of Jeroboam's subjects at once; and Baasa exterminated his family. (Calmet) --- The latter had now begun his conspiracy. (Abulensis, q. 26.)"

(Calmet) --- <i>To provoke.</i> These people did not perhaps design (Haydock) to make God their enemy, no more than their king did, ver. 9. But their actions had that effect. Such expressions denote not the final cause, but the sequel of other facts, without direct intention. (Worthington) --- Yet these sins might probably be called sins of malice. (Haydock) --- They were all involved in ruin, because they had been accomplices in wickedness. (Menochius)'

        - '1KI:14:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Sin.</i> This is the common effect of evil example in kings. <i>Plus exemplo quàm peccato nocent.</i> (Cicero, Leg. iii.) "As it is esteemed a sort of service to imitate the customs and vices of the king; they laid aside all piety, lest they might seem to upbraid the king with his impiety, if they should live in a virtuous manner." (Lactantius v. 6.) The crimes of kings are seldom confined to their own persons. (Calmet)'

        - '1KI:14:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Thersa.</i> Septuagint inform us that Jeroboam had built this place, which the call <i>Sarira,</i> while he was employed by Solomon. No wonder, therefore, that it is not mentioned by Josue. Its exact situation is not known, though it must have been very delightful, since Solomon compares the spouse to it. (Calmet) --- Where we read <i>sweet,</i> (Canticle of Canticles vi. 3.) Hebrew has, "Thou art beautiful....as Thersa, and comely as Jerusalem." Hither Jeroboam had removed his court from Sichem. (Tirinus) --- Some place Thersa in the tribe of Manasses; (Adrichomius) others, in that of Ephraim. (Bonfrere) --- <i>House.</i> Hebrew, "door," or gate of the city, when the prophet had denounced that the child should die, (ver. 12.) unless the palace was contiguous to the walls. (Haydock)'

        - '1KI:14:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>The book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel.</i> This book, which is often mentioned in the Book of Kings, is long since lost. For as to the books of <i>Paralipomenon,</i> or <i>Chronicles,</i> (which the Hebrews call <i>the words of the days</i>) they were certainly written after the Book of Kings, since they frequently refer to them; (Challoner) and they also remit us to these journals for farther information.

(Calmet) --- <i>Ammonitess.</i> She probably perverted her son; (Menochius) so that he only continued three years faithful to the Lord; (2 Paralipomenon xi. 17.) when his people readily imitated the idolatry of Israel, as they had been already staggered in their faith by the conduct of Solomon.

(Calmet) --- Roboam was informed by Semeias, that resistance would be fruitless; and being humbled, he repaired more frequently to the temple, ver. 18.

      v:010: '1KI:14:10 | 10 | 10 | Therefore, behold I will bring evils upon the house of Jeroboam, and {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}will cut of from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up, and the last in Israel: and I will sweep away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as dung is swept away till all be clean.'
      v:011: '1KI:14:11 | 11 | 11 | Them that shall die of Jeroboam in the city, the dogs shall eat: and them that shall die in the field, the birds of the air shall devour: for the Lord hath spoken <i>it</i>.'

      v:013: '1KI:14:13 | 13 | 13 | And all Israel shall mourn for him, and shall bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall be laid in a sepulchre, because in his regard there is found a good word from the Lord, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.'
      v:014: '1KI:14:14 | 14 | 14 | And the Lord hath appointed himself a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam in this day, and in this time:'
      v:015: '1KI:14:15 | 15 | 15 | And the Lord God shall strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water: and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river: because they have made to themselves groves, to provoke the Lord.'
      v:016: '1KI:14:16 | 16 | 16 | And the Lord shall give up Israel for the sins of Jeroboam, who hath sinned, and made Israel to sin.'
      v:017: '1KI:14:17 | 17 | 17 | And the wife of Jeroboam arose, and departed, and came to Thersa: and when she was coming in to the threshold of the house, the child died,'
      v:018: '1KI:14:18 | 18 | 18 | And they buried him. And all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahias, the prophet.'
      v:019: '1KI:14:19 | 19 | 19 | And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he fought, and how he reigned, behold they are written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel.'
      v:020: '1KI:14:20 | 20 | 20 | And the days that Jeroboam reigned, were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers: and Nadab, his son, reigned in his stead.'
      v:021: "1KI:14:21 | 21 | 21 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And Roboam, the son of Solomon, reigned in Juda: Roboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord chose out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naama, an Ammonitess."
      v:022: '1KI:14:22 | 22 | 22 | And Juda did evil in the sight of the Lord, and provoked him above all that their fathers had done, in their sins which they committed.'
      v:023: '1KI:14:23 | 23 | 23 | For they also built them altars, and statues, and groves, upon every high hill, and under every green tree:'
      v:024: '1KI:14:24 | 24 | 24 | There were also the effeminate in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the people, whom the Lord had destroyed before the face of the children of Israel.'
      v:025: '1KI:14:25 | 25 | 25 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Sesac, king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.'
      v:026: "1KI:14:26 | 26 | 26 | And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the king's treasures, and carried all off: as also the shields of gold which {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Solomon had made:"
      v:027: "1KI:14:27 | 27 | 27 | And Roboam made shields of brass instead of them, and delivered them into the hand of the captains of the shield-bearers, and of them that kept watch before the gate of the king's house."
      v:028: '1KI:14:28 | 28 | 28 | And when the king went into the house of the Lord, they whose office it was to go before him, carried them: and afterwards they brought them back to the armoury of the shield-bearers.'

    commentary:
      v:002:
        - '1KI:15:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Years,</i> wanting some months. <i>Maacha.</i> She is called elsewhere, Michaia, daughter of Uriel; but is was a common thing, in those days, for a person to have two names. (Challoner) --- <i>Abessalom</i> and <i>Absalom,</i> the son of David are the same, 2 Paralipomenon xi. 21. (Calmet) --- St. Jerome (Trad.) is of a different opinion. (Menochius) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] viii. 10.) intimates that Maacha was the daughter of Thamar. The eldest daughter, in the kingdom of Gessur, seems to have been usually styled Maacha, ver. 10. (Tirinus)'
      v:004:
        - "1KI:15:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Lamp,</i> son; (chap. xi. 36.) though he deserved to have his family exterminated. (Calmet) --- He is preserved for his father's sake. (Worthington)"
      v:005:
        - "1KI:15:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Hethite.</i> This could not be excused. But all his other imperfections might not appear criminal in the eyes of the world, as they had some pretext of virtue; so that God reserves the judgment of them to himself, and to David's conscience, who confessed that he had <i>sinned,</i> 2 Kings xxiv. 10. (Tirinus) --- <i>Except David, Ezechias, and Josias, all</i> the kings of Juda <i>committed sin;</i> (Ecclesiasticus xlix. 5.; Calmet) and not one of those who ruled over Israel, gave an example of virtue. (Haydock) --- David soon entered into himself, with respect to his other failings. But he continued for a long time involved in the guilt of adultery and murder. (Sanchez)"
      v:006:
        - '1KI:15:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Roboam.</i> This had been remarked, chap. xiv. 30. (Haydock) --- There was a domestic quarrel between the two families. (Calmet) --- Some suspect that Roboam is placed to designate his successors, or that we ought to read, Abia. (Sanchez) --- Castalion rashly ventures to alter the text. (Calmet) --- Abiam gained a decisive victory over Jeroboam, ver. 7., and 2 Paralipomenon xiii. 3.'
      v:009:
        - "1KI:15:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Year</i> complete, when the 21st was running on. (Usher) --- Septuagint, \"the 24th.\" (Calmet) --- But Grabe's edition agrees with the Hebrew. (Haydock)"
      v:010:
        - "1KI:15:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>His mother's,</i> &c. That is, his grandmother; unless we suppose, which is not improbable, that the Maacha here named is different from the Maacha mentioned [in] ver. 2. (Challoner) --- She was probably another grand-daughter of David's son, (Calmet) as such are frequently styled simply daughters. So David is called the <i>father</i> of Asa, (ver. 11.; Haydock) though he was really his great-grandfather. (Menochius)"
      v:012:
        - '1KI:15:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Effeminate.</i> See chap. xiv. 24. Yet his zeal could not entirely eradicate this evil. There was room for the exertions of his son Josaphat, chap. xxii. 47. (Calmet) --- The king punished with death such as he could discover. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - '1KI:15:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Priapus.</i> He would not spare such abominations in his own family. (Menochius) He took from his mother the direction of the palace, (Vatable) and her guards. (Grotius) --- Hebrew, "even her he removed from <i>being</i> queen, because she had made a Miphlatstah." (Haydock) --- Septuagint render this term a <i>synod,</i> "meeting," or something shameful; also a cavern, or <i>den;</i> and in Paralipomenon, the "idol" Astarte. St. Jerome also gives different meanings; so that the precise import is not well known. Most people translate, "a scarecrow;" (Calmet) <i>terriculum.</i> In the gardens of Greece and of Rome, the figure of Priapus was set up (Du Hamel) to frighten thieves and birds away.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Inde ego furum aviumque</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Maxima formido.</i> (Horace, Sat. 1. 8.){JOIN}Others understand that Pan, another frightening idol, is here meant; (Castalion) or the abominations of Phallus and Ithyphallus, derived from the same Hebrew word. (Seldon) --- As the goddess Astarte, or <i>Asera,</i> "the grove," here the object of adoration, was the wife of Adonis, it is probable, that the same obscenities were carried in triumph, as Herodotus (ii. 28., and 49.) specifies in the description of the festival of Bacchus, celebrated by the Egyptians. --- <i>To him.</i> Protestants, "She had made an idol in the grove." Hebrew also, "to Asera; and Asa destroyed her idol, (miphlatstah) and burnt it." (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - '1KI:15:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>The high places.</i> There were <i>excelsa,</i> or <i>high places,</i> of two different kinds. Some were set up and dedicated to the worship of idols, or strange gods: and these Asa removed, 2 Paralipomenon xiv. 2. Others were only altars of the true God, but were erected contrary to the law, which allowed of no sacrifices but in the temple; and these were not removed by Asa. (Challoner) --- They had been built before the temple, and tolerated by the prophets; (Calmet) and, though they were now improper for sacrifices, (Haydock) Asa thought it would be imprudent to molest them, (Calmet) as perhaps he could not take them away. (Du Hamel) --- He left also the ruins of (Haydock) the temples built by Solomon, (Worthington) on Mount Olivet, (4 Kings xxiii.; Menochius) as no longer dangerous. (Salien) --- <i>Lord.</i> Asa had his faults; but never forsook the worship of the Lord. (Challoner) --- In the same sense, David is so often praised as a just prince. Asa threw a prophet into prison, and placed his trust as much in physicians, &c., 2 Paralipomenon xvi. 10, 12. But he did penance, and deserves to be ranked (Calmet) among the few just kings of Juda. (Haydock)'
      v:015:
        - '1KI:15:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Vowed.</i> Hebrew, "which he himself had dedicated," or <i>vowed,</i> 2 Paralipomenon xv. 18. (Haydock) --- Asa made liberal presents to the Lord, and gave what his father had promised, (Menochius) probably during the famous battle against Jeroboam, 2 Paralipomenon xiii. 5. (Abulensis, q. 17.) Abiam was a wicked prince, and had neglected this duty, that heirs were bound to execute the vows of their parents, though Moses does not express it. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - '1KI:15:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Their days:</i> not that they were always fighting. (Haydock) --- Open war was declared only in the 35<i>th year of Asa,</i> (2 Paralipomenon xv. 19.) which must be dated from the schism, and not from the commencement of his reign; since his rival, Baasa, enjoyed the sovereignty only 24 years, and died in the 26th of Asa, which was the 36th from the division of the two kingdoms. Thus Hardouin observes that the years of Commodus, in some ancient Egyptians medals, are dated from the reign of M. Aurelius, chief of that family; so that the first of Commodus is inscribed the twenty-first of Aurelius. Asa defeated Zara in the fifteenth, and attacked Israel in the sixteen year of his reign. (Usher) (Tirinus) (Calmet) --- Others would substitute 25 for 35, (Grotius; Capel.) though contrary to the text, and to all the versions. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - '1KI:15:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Rama,</i> fortifying it with <i>a wall</i> all round, 2 Paralipomenon xvi. (Haydock) --- <i>Rama</i> signifies, "a height." This fort commanded a narrow pass, between the two kingdoms, (Calmet) and cut off all communication; which Baasa dreaded, lest his subjects should return to the service of the true God, and of Juda. (Haydock) --- Josue (xviii. 25.) mentions Rama, near Gaboan, (Calmet) about five miles north of Jerusalem. (St. Jerome) --- There was another towards the south. (Menochius) --- But there the king of Israel would have no power. (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - '1KI:15:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>House.</i> Sesac had not carried off all the treasures, (Calmet) and the losses had been since in a great measure repaired, ver. 15. (Haydock) --- Asa thought himself justified in employing these treasures in such a pressing necessity, (Calmet) perhaps (Haydock) without reason, as the danger was not so great; and he might have gained the victory without having recourse to an infidel, if he had placed more confidence in God, 2 Paralipomenon xvi. 7, 9. (Menochius) --- He had already discomfited Zara, king of Ethiopia, and had an army of 580,000 men. (Calmet) (2 Paralipomenon xiv. 8.) --- <i>Tabremon,</i> "Good Remmon," idol of Damascus. (Haydock) --- <i>Hezion,</i> the same with Razon, chap. xi. 23. (Menochius)'
      v:019:
        - '1KI:15:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>League.</i> The infidel is ready to take part with the best bidder. (Haydock) --- Benadad gains a double reward, as he plunders the conquered. (Menochius)'
      v:020:
        - '1KI:15:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Ahion,</i> or Ain, remote in the north, whence Theglathphalasar took away captives, (4 Kings xv. 29.) is perhaps the <i>Enan</i> of Ezechiel xlviii. 1., and Numbers xxxiv. 9. --- <i>Maacha.</i> In Paralipomenon, <i>Abel-maim,</i> "Abela of the waters," 2 Kings xx. 14. --- <i>Ceneroth,</i> near the sea of Tiberias, Josue xi. 2. Benadad kept possession of some of these places, and even built streets in Samaria, chap. xx. 34.'
      v:021:
        - '1KI:15:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Returned.</i> So the Septuagint. Hebrew, "dwelt." (Calmet) --- He returned to protect his own dominions, (Menochius) and shut himself up in his capital. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - '1KI:15:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Excused.</i> "When the country is to be defended, all exemptions cease." (Leg. ult.) (Calmet) --- Septuagint seem to preserve the terms of the original untranslated, "Asa called all....to Annacim." Hebrew <i>en naki,</i> (Haydock) means, "no one exempt." (Calmet) --- <i>Rama</i> belonged to the enemy; and, as it appears from this passage, was in the vicinity of Maspha. (Haydock) --- <i>Gabaa,</i> the city of Saul, (Menochius) adding fresh fortifications, as this and <i>Maspha</i> were frontier towns, against the inroads of Israel. (Haydock)'
      v:023:
        - '1KI:15:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Strength.</i> Septuagint, "dynasty," or power, whether of his dominions or of his person. (Calmet) --- <i>Feet,</i> with the gout, (Menochius) three years before his death. He did not confide in the Lord sufficiently, 2 Paralipomenon xvi. 12. His body was embalmed or burnt, unless aromatic spices evaporated while it was laid on a bed of state, before it was consigned to the tomb, which Asa had prepared for himself in the city of David, 2 Paralipomenon xvi. 14.'
      v:025:
        - '1KI:15:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Two years,</i> incomplete; since he commenced his reign in the second, and died in the third year of Asa, ver. 28. (Calmet) --- Petau only allows him, "a few months;" and supposes, that he had been associated on the throne with Jeroboam. But this is unnecessary. (Houbigant) --- Nadab was the first king of Israel, who fell a prey to the fury of his subjects. (Salien, the year before Christ 971.)'
      v:027:
        - '1KI:15:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Gebbethon,</i> of the tribe of Dan, occupied by the Philistines. It was often attacked, chap. xvi. 15. (Calmet) --- The occasion of this war is not known. (Menochius)'
      v:029:
        - '1KI:15:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Jeroboam.</i> The author of schism is punished in his posterity. (Worthington) --- The body of Nadab was left unburied, chap. xiv. 11. (Menochius)'

(Haydock) --- Thersa had lately been so much ruined by civil wars, that Amri thought proper to choose a new seat of government. Samaria was greatly adorned by succeeding kings, chap. xxii. 39. It stood in a delightful and commanding situation, and gave its name to the adjacent territory, and to the whole kingdom of Israel. Benadad besieged it twice; and Salmanasar took it. The kings of Egypt laid claim to it, after the death of Alexander: but Antiochus, of Syria, took it from them. Hyrcanus levelled it with the ground.

He did not insist that she should embrace the true religion, when he married her; as it is supposed former kings had done, when they espoused women who had been brought up in idolatry. (Calmet) --- He even introduced her country's idols, and thus enhanced upon the wickedness of his predecessors. (Haycock) --- <i>Ethbaal.</i> Menander (following Josephus, contra Apion i.) calls him Ithobaal, and remarks that his reign was memorable for a year's drought; probably that of three years, under Achaz, chap. xvii. 1.

      v:008: '1KI:16:8 | 8 | 8 | In the {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}six and twentieth year of Asa, king of Juda, Ela, the son of Baasa, reigned over Israel, in Thersa, two years.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1KI:17:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Elias</i> means, "the strong God." Some Greeks derive the name of the prophet from {GREEK:START elios}ηλιοσ{GREEK:END}, "the sun," improperly. His parentage is not known, nor even his tribe. Thesbe was situated in the tribe of Gad. The Fathers agree that Elias never was married. He seems to have had no fixed abode; but was sent to the house of Israel, to maintain the cause of the true God, with the most active and generous zeal. He may have presided over the colleges of the prophets, (Calmet) which were then numerous in Israel, particularly at Mount Carmel, (Tirinus) notwithstanding the general corruption, chap. xviii. 13., and xix. 10. (Haydock) --- <i>I stand,</i> to serve (Numbers iii. 6.) and pray, James v. 17., and Luke iv. 25. He calls God to witness, like St. Paul, Galatians i. 20. --- <i>Mouth.</i> Stupendous power and assurance of the prophet, with which the pagans have nothing to compare. (Calmet) --- God had threatened his people with drought, if they proved faithless, Deuteronomy xxviii. 24. Elias begs that this punishment may now serve to open their eyes. (Tirinus)'
      v:003:
        - '1KI:17:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Carith,</i> between Samaria and the Jordan. It was a torrent or valley. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - '1KI:17:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Ravens.</i> Hebrew <i>horebim,</i> (Haydock) is sometimes rendered "Arabs," by the Vulgate, 2 Paralipomenon xxi. 16. Others would translate, "merchants," or the inhabitants of Arabo, which was near Carith. They suppose that the ravens, being unclean birds, would never have been employed. But they were only forbidden to be eaten or touched, when dead; and God is not restricted by his own laws. He might thus chose to display his wonderful providence. St. Jerome relates how St. Paul, the first hermit, was fed thus by a raven, with half a loaf a day; and a whole one was sent, when St. Anthony went to see him. (Calmet) --- Yet Kennicott mentions this as one of the improvements which might be now made in the Protestant version, "the Orbim," or inhabitants of Oreb, or Orbo. <i>Orbim, accolæ villæ in finibus Arabum Eliæ dederunt alimenta.</i> (Jerom iii. 119.) --- It is not clear to what passage he refers. (Diss. ii. p. 581.) Another instance occurs, Judges xv. 4., where instead of foxes, he would substitute "300 sheaves of corn, placed end to end." But if there were no mistranslations of great importance, the version might subsist. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - '1KI:17:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>And flesh.</i> So the Hebrew, &c. But some copies of the Septuagint have, "bread in the morning, and flesh in the evening." (Theodoret, q. 52.) --- It is idle to inquire whence the ravens took this food. (Calmet) --- Some say from the kitchen of Achab. (Abulensis) --- The minister of angels undoubtedly intervened. (Tirinus) --- God provides his servant with what may support nature, without any wine or delicacies. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - '1KI:17:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Some time.</i> Literally, "after days," (Haydock) which some explain of a year; others, of half that time, or less, as the torrent would not be long supplied with water.'
      v:009:
        - '1KI:17:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Sidonians,</i> and nearer their city than it was to Tyre. (Calmet) --- <i>Commanded,</i> or provided that she shall feed thee. So he commanded the ravens, ver. 4. (Menochius) --- It appears that the widow had received no precise intimation, ver. 12. She was not an Israelite, (Luke iv. 25.) but probably a pagan. (St. Chrysostom, &c.) --- Many suppose that Elias did not know, at first, that she was to entertain him. (Calmet) --- But both the one and the other might be divinely instructed how to act. In due time the widow and the prophet became acquainted with the will of God, and complied with it. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - '1KI:17:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>First.</i> He puts the faith of the widow to a severe trial; and the gospel requires nothing more perfect than what she practised. The true faith, which she then received, was her first and most precious recompense; and we shall soon see, that her guest drew down blessings upon her. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - '1KI:17:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Until,</i> nor for some time afterwards; otherwise they would still have been in danger of perishing, as the corn could not grow immediately. (Salien, the year before Christ 929.)'
      v:017:
        - '1KI:17:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>In him.</i> He died. (Haydock) --- The Jews, followed by some Christians, assert that this boy was the prophet Jonas. But Jonas was a Hebrew, from Geth-opher, 4 Kings xiv. 25., and Jonas i. 9. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - '1KI:17:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Remembered.</i> Have I not waited upon thee with sufficient attention? or have not thine eyes been able to bear with my imperfections? (Haydock) --- Before thy arrival, God seemed not to notice my transgressions. She is convinced that "all just punishment presupposes an offence." (St. Augustine, Retract. i. 9.) This child died like Lazarus for the greater glory of God. (St. Augustine, ad Simp. ii. 5.) (John xi. 4.) (Worthington)'
      v:020:
        - '1KI:17:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Her son.</i> He speaks in the most earnest and familiar manner, shewing his confidence in God. (Salien)'
      v:021:
        - '1KI:17:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Times,</i> in honour of the blessed Trinity. (Menochius) --- He puts himself in this posture, as if to co-operate with God in warming the child; as Eliseus did, (4 Kings iv. 34,) as well as St. Paul, (Acts xx. 10,) and St. Benedict. (St. Gregory, Dial. ii. 32.) This posture represented the condescension of Jesus Christ in assuming our nature, to give us life; and the Old Testament affords few more striking figures of this union. (Calmet) (St. Augustine, ser. 201. de Temp.; St. Bernard xvi. in Cant.) (Tirinus)'
      v:024:

      v:002: '1KI:17:2 | 2 | 2 | And the word of the Lord came to him, saying:'
      v:003: '1KI:17:3 | 3 | 3 | Get thee hence, and go towards the east, and hide thyself by the torrent of Carith, which is over-against the Jordan;'
      v:004: '1KI:17:4 | 4 | 4 | And there thou shalt drink of the torrent: and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.'
      v:005: '1KI:17:5 | 5 | 5 | So he went, and did according to the word of the Lord: and going, he dwelt by the torrent Carith, which is over-against the Jordan.'
      v:006: '1KI:17:6 | 6 | 6 | And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the torrent.'
      v:007: '1KI:17:7 | 7 | 7 | But {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}after some time the torrent was dried up: for it had not rained upon the earth.'
      v:008: '1KI:17:8 | 8 | 8 | Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying:'
      v:009: '1KI:17:9 | 9 | 9 | Arise, and go to Sarephta, of the Sidonians, and dwell there: for I have commanded a widow-woman there to feed thee.'
      v:010: '1KI:17:10 | 10 | 10 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}He arose, and went to Sarephta. And when he was come to the gate of the city, he saw the widow-woman gathering sticks, and he called her, and said to her: Give me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.'
      v:011: '1KI:17:11 | 11 | 11 | And when she was going to fetch it, he called after her, saying: Bring me also, I beseech thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.'
      v:012: '1KI:17:12 | 12 | 12 | And she answered: As the Lord thy God liveth, I have no bread, but only a handful of meal in a pot, and a little oil in a cruise: behold I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it, for me and my son, that we may eat it and die.'
      v:013: '1KI:17:13 | 13 | 13 | And Elias said to her: Fear not; but go, and do as thou hast said: but first make for me of the same meal a little hearth-cake, and bring it to me, and after make for thyself and thy son.'
      v:014: '1KI:17:14 | 14 | 14 | For thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: The pot of meal shall not waste, nor the cruise of oil be diminished, until the day wherein the Lord will give rain upon the face of the earth.'

      v:017: '1KI:17:17 | 17 | 17 | And it came to pass after this, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick, and the sickness was very grievous, so that there was no breath left in him.'
      v:018: '1KI:17:18 | 18 | 18 | And she said to Elias: What have I to do with thee, thou man of God? art thou come to me, that my iniquities should be remembered, and that thou shouldst kill my son?'
      v:019: '1KI:17:19 | 19 | 19 | And Elias said to her: Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him into the upper chamber where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.'

        - '1KI:18:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Year</i> of his sojourning at Sarephta. As other six months elapsed before the drought was removed, it is probable that Elias had spent them at Carith, James v. 17. (Calmet) --- <i>Earth.</i> God is pleased to withdraw his chastisement, though the guilty were not yet reclaimed. (Salien)'
      v:002:
        - '1KI:18:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Samaria,</i> and the vicinity. The people could procure corn from a distance. But Achab is solicitous to find grass, ver. 5.'
      v:003:
        - '1KI:18:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Abdias.</i> Some suppose that he was the fourth of the minor prophets, or the husband of the Sunamitess, (4 Kings iv.) or the third of the captains, who were ordered by Ochozias to seize Elias, 4 Kings i. 13. (Tirinus) --- But this is uncertain. He took care of the persecuted prophets, (ver. 4, 13.) judging it better to obey God than man. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - '1KI:18:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Himself.</i> So Providence ordered it, that the prophet might declare his sentiments to him freely. (Haydock) --- Achab would go in person, another way, that he might not be imposed upon. He was more solicitous for his cattle than for his subjects. (Menochius)'
      v:007:

      v:010:
        - "1KI:18:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>An oath of every kingdom,</i> adjuring all his neighbours to tell if they knew any thing about Elias. (Haydock) --- Achab wished to make him restore rain, or to punish him for the refusal. (Calmet) --- How stupid he must have been, not to perceive that God was punishing him! (Haydock) --- Elias must have kept himself very retired, not to be discovered at Sarephta, which was so near, (Calmet) and where Jezabel's father reigned. But God could render him invisible, even upon the high road, when he went thither. (Haydock)"
      v:012:
        - '1KI:18:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Spirit.</i> Abdias supposed that the prophet had been transported to some unknown country, (Calmet) as he was afterwards to paradise. His disciples imagined, <i>by a violent wind,</i> 4 Kings ii. 16. (Haydock) --- Thus the spirit of the Lord took away Philip, (Acts viii. 39,) and conducted Jesus into the desert, Matthew iv. 1., and Mark i. 12. (Calmet) --- <i>Infancy.</i> This he mentions, that the prophet might take pity on him. (Menochius)'
      v:013:
        - '1KI:18:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>A hundred.</i> Hence we may judge how numerous they were. These prophets were not perhaps all inspired: but they had such at their head; and spent their time in working and in the divine praises. They were the salt and light of the earth, the pillars of the true religion, against whom Jezabel bent all her fury, during the first years of the drought. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - '1KI:18:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Kill me.</i> He had expressed this fear twice before. Elias perceiving how much he was agitated, confirmed him with an oath. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - '1KI:18:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Meet Elias,</i> out of respect, (Abulensis) or rather to upbraid him.'
      v:017:
        - '1KI:18:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Troublest Israel?</i> Thus the wicked esteem those disturbers of the public repose, who will not suffer them to go on in their wickedness unmolested. Thus the Jews complain of Jesus Christ, Luke xxiii. 5. Such a war is better than a false peace: and Achab, in fact, proclaims the praise of Elias, who strove by easy means to make the people open their eyes and return to their God. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - 1KI:18:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>House.</i> Your impiety has brought on this scourge. I only denounced it. (Salien)
      v:019:
        - "1KI:18:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Fifty,</i> attached to Baal, and fed by the king; while the prophets of the <i>groves,</i> or of <i>Astarte,</i> lived at the queen's expense. They imitated the lives of the true prophets, to delude the people. --- <i>Carmel</i> was long after famous fo the worship of Apollo, who was the same with Baal, or the sun, Josue xix. 26. (Calmet) --- No mention is made of rain: but it was understood that it would be given, when the people should assemble to hear God's determination. (Menochius) --- Achab durst not therefore refuse to convoke them. (Haydock)"
      v:021:
        - '1KI:18:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Sides:</i> sometimes adoring God; at other times the devil. (Calmet) --- Such an expostulation ought to be made to those who are indifferent about religion. (Worthington) --- <i>You cannot serve two masters.</i> (Calmet) --- They wished to unite the service of both, foolishly supposing that there might be many gods; as some, at present assert that many religions may be pleasing to heaven. (Haydock) --- <i>A word,</i> not knowing the drift of his proposal. But, as they might perhaps rely that they considered Baal also as a god, Elias puts this to the test of a miracle; being convinced that God would never suffer the devils to prevail on this occasion. (Salien) --- They might otherwise have brought down fire, as they will do in the days of Antichrist, Apocalypse xiii. 13. (Menochius)'
      v:022:
        - '1KI:18:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>I.</i> Hebrew repeats "I," to make the contrast more striking. Elias alone was present, in this assembly, as the prophet of the Lord. (Haydock) --- He knew that Abdias had preserved 100: but they were concealed. --- <i>Men.</i> The other 400 of Jezabel did not appear.'
      v:024:
        - "1KI:18:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Call ye.</i> He does not order them to invoke idols; but challenges them to prove their divinity, if they can. --- <i>By fire.</i> On such trying occasions, it is not tempting God to ask for a miracle. God had given this proof of <i>fire</i> repeatedly, Genesis xv. 17., Leviticus ix. 24., and 2 Paralipomenon vii. 1. He will restrain the devil's power, to confirm the truth, Mark xvi. 20. (Worthington)"
      v:026:
        - '1KI:18:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>That they.</i> Hebrew, "which he (Achaz) had made;" (Calmet) or, "which was made." (Haydock) --- The altar of Elias was erected afterwards, ver. 30. The prophets of Baal acted in a foolish manner, (Calmet) as if in jest, but really despairing of success. (Haydock) --- The pagans were accustomed to dance around their altars: --- <i>Pingues spatiatur ad aras.</i> (Virgil, Æneid iv.) --- and some would translate, "near the altar." We might apply to these prophets, the verses of Horace:{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Dedit risusque jocosque,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Dum, <i>flammà</i> sine, thura liquescere limine sacro</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}Persuadere cupit: credat Judæus Apella{JOIN}{BQ:2}Non ego. (Sat. i. 5.)'
      v:027:
        - '1KI:18:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Talking</i> to some of his prophets, (Calmet) or in deep contemplation. (Montanus) --- <i>An inn.</i> Septuagint, "giving oracles;" or, "he is pursuing." (Pagnin)'
      v:028:
        - '1KI:18:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Blood.</i> Strange infatuation! which has nevertheless prevailed in many pagan mysteries and countries. Thus were Bellona, Cybele, the Syrian goddess, &c., honoured and appeased. (Calmet) --- God prohibits this fury, Deuteronomy xiv. 1. The devil always endeavours to destroy or to injure man. (Menochius){JOIN}{BQ:2}"Ipsa bipenne suos cædit violenta lacertos,{JOIN}{BQ:2}Sanguineque effuso spargit inepta deam."  (Tebullus)'
      v:029:
        - "1KI:18:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Prophesying,</i> \"acting like fools;\" (Chaldean) performing their superstitious rites, and singing the praises of their god, &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Sacrifice,</i> by Elias, who had assigned all the morning to Baal's prophets. Perhaps he waited till the time of the evening sacrifice, Exodus xxix. 38. (Menochius)"
      v:030:
        - '1KI:18:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Down,</i> by the false prophets, whose fury the people now repressed. (Tirinus) --- The altar might have been erected, under the judges, lawfully. (Calmet)'
      v:031:
        - '1KI:18:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Twelve stones,</i> (as [in] Exodus xxiv., &c.) intimating that he acted in the name of all; (Menochius) and in order that all Israel might return with one heart to the service of God. (Haydock) --- The prophet did not follow his own spirit in erecting this altar. (Calmet)'
      v:032:
        - '1KI:18:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Furrows.</i> Hebrew, "of two (sathayim) measures of seed." These furrows Elias filled with water, to impede the natural activity of fire, and to shew the miracle in a more striking light; (Haydock) as also to convince all that there was no deceit. An author quoted, under the name of St. Chrysostom, says that the pagans had sometimes subterraneous passages, by which they kindled the wood on the altar, as if by miracle, <i>ita ut multi decepti ignem illum cœlestem esse existiment.</i> (ap. Surium iv.)'
      v:034:
        - 1KI:18:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Time.</i> So that the wood was less disposed to catch fire. (Menochius)
      v:037:
        - 1KI:18:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Again.</i> This effect he hoped for from the miracle.
      v:038:
        - '1KI:18:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Trench,</i> as if it had been of an inflammable nature. Julian himself was forced to acknowledge this miracle. "This, says he, once happened under Moses, and, a long while after, again under Elias, the Thesbite."'
      v:040:
        - "1KI:18:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Cison,</i> at the foot of Carmel. (Adrichomius) --- Achab durst not protect his prophets, being confounded by the evidence of the miracle, (Menochius) and the unanimity of the people's cry. (Haydock) --- <i>Killed them,</i> by God's inspiration, (Calmet) as impostors, who had deluded the people, and were worthy of death."
      v:041:
        - '1KI:18:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Sound.</i> It will as surely come, as if you heard it falling. (Haydock)'
      v:042:
        - '1KI:18:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>Knees,</i> in fervent and humble prayer. God made his servant wait some time before he granted his request, that he might not give way to vanity. The people were not present, so that there was no danger of their being scandalized. (Menochius)'
      v:044:
        - '1KI:18:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>Sea,</i> the Mediterranean, which could be seen from Carmel. (Haydock) --- Hence the rain commonly came in that country, Luke xii. 54.'
      v:045:
        - '1KI:18:45 | 45 | 45 | <i>Jezrahel,</i> where Achab had a palace, chap. xxi. 1. (Calmet) --- He stopped for shelter, as he had not time to reach Samaria. (Menochius)'
      v:046:
        - '1KI:18:46 | 46 | 46 | <i>Before Achab,</i> notwithstanding the king was drawn by horses, (Calmet) and Elias was advanced in years, chap. xix. 4. (Menochius) --- The invigorating spirit gave him such strength and agility, (Haydock) as Jezrahel was 12 or 15 leagues, (Calmet) or about 36 miles, from Carmel. In the Levant, impostors still run very swiftly before the chariots of princes, to imitate Elias. (Calmet)'

      v:031: '1KI:18:31 | 31 | 31 | And he took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord came, saying: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Israel shall be thy name.'
      v:032: '1KI:18:32 | 32 | 32 | And he built with the stones an altar to the name of the Lord: and he made a trench for water, of the breadth of two furrows round about the altar.'
      v:033: '1KI:18:33 | 33 | 33 | And he laid the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid it upon the wood.'
      v:034: '1KI:18:34 | 34 | 34 | And he said: Fill four buckets with water, and pour it upon the burnt-offering, and upon the wood. And again he said: Do the same the second time. And when they had done it the second time, he said: Do the same also the third time. And they did so the third time.'
      v:035: '1KI:18:35 | 35 | 35 | And the water run round about the altar, and the trench was filled with water.'
      v:036: '1KI:18:36 | 36 | 36 | And when it was now time to offer the holocaust, Elias, the prophet, came near and said: O Lord God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, shew this day that thou art the God of Israel, and I thy servant, and that according to thy commandment I have done all these things.'
      v:037: '1KI:18:37 | 37 | 37 | Hear me, O Lord, hear me: that this people may learn that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart again.'
      v:038: '1KI:18:38 | 38 | 38 | Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the holocaust, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.'
      v:039: '1KI:18:39 | 39 | 39 | And when all the people saw this, they fell on their faces, and they said: The Lord, he is God; the Lord, he is God.'
      v:040: '1KI:18:40 | 40 | 40 | And Elias said to them: Take the prophets of Baal, and let not one of them escape. And when they had taken them, Elias brought them down to the torrent Cison, and killed them there.'
      v:041: '1KI:18:41 | 41 | 41 | And Elias said to Achab: Go up, eat and drink: for there is a sound of abundance of rain.'
      v:042: '1KI:18:42 | 42 | 42 | Achab went up to eat and drink: and Elias went up to the top of Carmel, and casting himself down upon the earth, put his face between his knees,'
      v:043: '1KI:18:43 | 43 | 43 | And he said to his servant: Go up, and look towards the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said: There is nothing. And again he said to him: Return seven times.'
      v:044: "1KI:18:44 | 44 | 44 | And at the seventh time: Behold a little cloud arose out of the sea like a man's foot. And he said: Go up, and say to Achab: Prepare thy chariot, and go down, lest the rain prevent thee."
      v:045: '1KI:18:45 | 45 | 45 | And while he turned himself this way and that way, behold the heavens grew dark, with clouds, and wind, and there fell a great rain. And Achab getting up, went away to Jezrahel:'
      v:046: '1KI:18:46 | 46 | 46 | And the hand of the Lord was upon Elias, and he girded up his loins, and ran before Achab, till he came to Jezrahel.'

    commentary:
      v:003:
        - "1KI:19:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Afraid.</i> Hebrew, \"he saw, arose, and went for his life.\" (Haydock) --- He was aware of a woman's anger, Ecclesiasticus xxv. 23. Though he goes intrepidly to meet Achab, he flees before a woman, God being desirous that he should exercise humility, (Theodoret, q. 57, &c.) though some think that he had given way to a secret fault; (Calmet) which is a groundless assertion. (Haydock) --- He must confess that all his strength is from above. (Tirinus) --- <i>Mind,</i> to escape notice. (Menochius) --- <i>Bersabee,</i> at the southern extremity of the kingdom of <i>Juda,</i> perhaps fifty leagues from Samaria, and five more from Jezrahel. (Calmet) --- <i>Servant,</i> the boy whom he had raised to life. (Abulensis)"
      v:004:
        - '1KI:19:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Desert.</i> It seems, towards Horeb. (Calmet) --- <i>Tree.</i> Hebrew <i>Rothem,</i> which term the Septuagint retain, "Rathmen." Symmachus has, "a shade." (Haydock) --- <i>Die.</i> Elias requested to die, not out of impatience or pusillanimity, but out of zeal against sin; and that he might no longer be witness of the miseries of his people, and the war they were waging against God and his servants. See ver. 10. (Challoner) --- He does not wish to fall into the hands of Jezabel, lest the idolaters should triumph: but he is willing to die, if God so order it. (Calmet) --- Mathathias entertained the like sentiments, 1 Machabees ii. 7. --- <i>Fathers:</i> that I should live longer than they did. (Menochius) (Ecclesiasticus xxx. 17.) --- If he had been weary of life, why did he flee? His answer to Achab shews that he was by no means timid. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - '1KI:19:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Cake,</i> baked in a hollow stone, covered with fire. The Arabs call such cakes, <i>Ridpha.</i> An angel brought this nourishment. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - '1KI:19:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Go.</i> Hebrew, "the journey <i>is</i> too great for thee," without this support. (Haydock) --- He spent forty days in this journey, as he did not follow the straitest road. Horeb is only about fifty leagues from Bersabee. (Calmet) --- He might have travelled thither in four or five days. (Menochius)'
      v:008:
        - '1KI:19:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>In the strength of that food,</i> &c. This bread with which Elias was fed in the wilderness, was a figure of the bread of life, which we receive in the blessed sacrament [of the Eucharist]: by the strength of which we are to be supported in our journey through the wilderness of this world, till we come to the true mountain of God, and his vision in a happy eternity. (Challoner) --- Horeb signifies "a rock, <i>or</i> dry wilderness." (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - '1KI:19:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Here.</i> Thy presence is necessary in Israel. (Tirinus) --- Elias had been guided by a natural fear. (Menochius) --- "With how great familiarity is he received by God!" (Tertullian, contra Psychic. vi.)'
      v:010:
        - '1KI:19:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Zeal;</i> ordering the idolatrous prophets to be destroyed, (Menochius) which has enkindled the rage of Jezabel against me. I cannot bear to see the general corruption. (Calmet) --- <i>Covenant;</i> neglecting circumcision, (Rabbins) and almost the whole law. (Haydock) --- <i>Altars.</i> Some had been erected by the prophets, (Estius) as the king would suffer none to go to Jerusalem. (Haydock) --- The idolaters threw them <i>down,</i> chap. xviii. 30. Such altars would have been unlawful in Juda. (Calmet) --- <i>I alone am left;</i> viz., of the prophets in the kingdom of Israel, or of the ten tribes; for in the kingdom of Juda, religion was at that time in a very flourishing condition, under the kings Asa and Josaphat. And even in Israel there remained several prophets, though not then known to Elias. See chap. xx. 13, 28, 35. (Challoner) (Worthington) --- Hebrew repeats <i>I,</i> as [in] ver. 14, and chap. xviii. 22. He might justly fear that those had been destroyed at last, whom Abdias had protected. At any rate, none durst appear in public to assist Elias. (Haydock) --- God informs him (ver. 18.) that all is not yet lost.'
      v:011:
        - '1KI:19:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Lord;</i> the angel, his representative. (Menochius) --- God had formerly granted the like favour to Moses, in the same place, Exodus xxxiii. 21.'
      v:012:
        - '1KI:19:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Air.</i> Something similar happened at the giving of the law, and at the propagation of the gospel, Exodus xix. 9, 16., and Acts ii. 2. The Lord was pleased to shew his prophet the difference between the two laws: the one was full of terror, the other of mildness. (Grotius) --- He insinuated likewise, that he could easily exterminate the offenders, but he chose to bear patiently with them; (Tirinus) and taught his prophet to moderate his zeal, and, after terrifying sinners, to being them to a sense of their duty by gentle means. (Sanctius) (Calmet) --- "His spirit is most indulgent and mild." ....<i>est teneræ serenitatis, apertus et simplex.</i> (Tertullian, contra Marcion xxiii.)'
      v:013:
        - '1KI:19:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Mantle,</i> out of respect, like Moses, Exodus iii. 6. So the cherubim veil their faces with their wings, Isaias vi. 2. (Menochius) --- Among the Orientals, to cover the face has the same import as when we pull of our hats. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - "1KI:19:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Desert,</i> avoiding the towns as much as possible, (Calmet) and travelling through the country of Ammon to Damascus. (Menochius) --- God does not send Elias again into the midst of danger, at Achab's court. (Haydock) --- <i>Hazael.</i> God exercises his authority over all nations, and disposes of crowns. He appoints Hazael to punish his people. It does not appear that Elias performed this commission in person, but by the hand of Eliseus, 4 Kings viii. 12. Neither do we find that Hazael was <i>anointed,</i> but he was \"declared king;\" in which sense the term is used, Judges ix. 8. (Salien) (Calmet) --- Yet Torniel believes, that Elias really anointed both Hazael and Jehu. He foretold, at least, (Haydock) that they should reign. (Worthington)"
      v:016:
        - '1KI:19:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Jehu, the son of</i> Jospahat, (4 Kings ix. 2.) and grandson of <i>Namsi.</i> (Menochius) --- Eliseus sent one of his disciples to anoint him, (4 Kings ix. 1.; Calmet) with common oil; the sacred was reserved for priests and the kings of Juda, according to the Rabbins. --- <i>Anoint,</i> or call to the ministry, perhaps by placing a mantle on his head, ver. 19. No mention is made of unction. (Calmet) --- Yet the Fathers have hence inferred that prophets received it, as well as priests and kings. (Sanctius) --- Elias had complained that he was left alone. God appoints him a coadjutor, and successor; a person who seemed to have yet made no immediate preparation for the office. His parents were probably known for their probity, and had taken no part in the worship of idols. (Calmet) --- <i>Abelmeula</i> was in the great plain, ten miles south of Scythopolis. (Eusebius)'
      v:017:
        - '1KI:19:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Shall be slain by Eliseus.</i> Eliseus did not kill any of the idolaters with the material sword; but he is here joined with Hazael and Jehu, the great instruments of God in punishing the idolatry of Israel, because he foretold to the former his exaltation to the kingdom of Syria, and the vengeance he would execute against Israel, and anointed the latter by one of his disciples to be king of Israel, with commission to extirpate the house of Achab. (Challoner) --- They left nothing imperfect in the vengeance, 4 Kings viii., and ix. Eliseus sent bears to destroy forty-two children of Bethel; (4 Kings ii. 23.; Calmet) and Abulensis (q. 23.) thinks that he might put many false prophets to death, as the Scripture does not mention every thing, (Menochius) and as Elias had done himself. (Haydock) --- Eliseus may also be the name of some general. (Du Hamel)'
      v:018:
        - "1KI:19:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Will leave.</i> Hebrew also, \"I have left,\" as Romans xi. 4. Septuagint, \"thou shalt leave.\" (Haydock) --- After answering the first part of the prophet's complaint, and informing him that the guilty should not pass unpunished, God lets him know that he is not left alone, but that many thousands (Calmet) even in Israel still continue faithful; so far was the true Church from being in danger of perishing entirely. (Haydock) --- <i>Seven</i> is often put for a great number, Proverbs xxiv. 16. Yet some suppose, (Calmet) that only this number served God out of 1,110,000 men in Israel, 1 Paralipomenon xxi. 5. (Grotius, &c.) --- <i>Hands.</i> To this custom the word <i>adore</i> owes it rise. (Haydock) --- The pagans kissed their right-hand, or the statue itself, when they could reach it, to testify their veneration. <i>Inter adorandum, dexteram ad osculum referimus.</i> (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxviii. 2.) Cicero (in Ver. 4.) mentions a beautiful statue of Hercules, the cheeks and beard of which had been rather worn with kissing; <i>non solum id venerari, sed etiam osculari solent.</i> See Genesis xviii. 2. (Calmet) --- Job xxxi. 27. (Menochius)"
      v:019:
        - '1KI:19:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Mantle,</i> perhaps to signify that he must change his manner of living. (Menochius)'
      v:020:
        - '1KI:19:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Kiss,</i> and bid them adieu. (Menochius) --- <i>To thee.</i> I have no farther orders. Obey the Spirit of God. <i>Hoc age.</i> Hebrew, "for what have I done to thee?" Did I require thee to follow me? Act as God may direct thee. Yet remember the ceremony which thou hast seen, and do not turn back (Calmet) to neglect thy office. (Haydock) (Matthew viii. 22., and Luke ix. 62.)'
      v:021:
        - '1KI:19:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Oxen,</i> to shew that he had relinquished his profession. (Menochius) --- "He makes a vow of them." (St. Jerome, ep. xxviii.) --- Elias waited for him in the field, while he made a feast for his fellow-citizens, at parting. (Calmet) --- Then both probably retreated to Carmel, (Salien) to watch over the instruction of the college of prophets. (Haydock)'

      v:002: '1KI:19:2 | 2 | 2 | And Jezabel sent a messenger to Elias, saying: Such and such things may the gods do to me, and add still more, if by this hour to-morrow I make not thy life as the life of one of them.'
      v:003: '1KI:19:3 | 3 | 3 | Then {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Elias was afraid, and rising up, he went whithersoever he had a mind: and he came to Bersabee of Juda, and left his servant there,'
      v:004: "1KI:19:4 | 4 | 4 | And he went forward, one day's journey into the desert. And when he was there, and sat under a juniper-tree, he requested for his soul that he might die, and said: It is enough for me, Lord; take away my soul: for I am no better than my fathers."
      v:005: '1KI:19:5 | 5 | 5 | And he cast himself down, and slept in the shadow of the juniper-tree: and behold an angel of the Lord touched him, and said to him: Arise and eat.'
      v:006: '1KI:19:6 | 6 | 6 | He looked, and behold there was at his head a hearth-cake, and a vessel of water: and he ate and drank, and he fell asleep again.'
      v:007: '1KI:19:7 | 7 | 7 | And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched him, and said to him: Arise, eat: for thou hast yet a great way to go.'
      v:008: '1KI:19:8 | 8 | 8 | And he arose, and ate and drank, and walked in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights, unto the mount of God, Horeb.'
      v:009: '1KI:19:9 | 9 | 9 | And when he was come thither, he abode in a cave: and behold the word of the Lord <i>came</i> unto him, and he said to him: What dost thou here, Elias?'
      v:010: '1KI:19:10 | 10 | 10 | And he answered: With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant: they have thrown down thy altars, they have slain thy prophets with the sword, and I alone am left, and they seek my life to take it away.'
      v:011: '1KI:19:11 | 11 | 11 | And he said to him: Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord: and behold the Lord passeth, and a great and strong wind before the Lord, overthrowing the mountains, and breaking the rocks in pieces: but the Lord is not in the wind. And after the wind, an earthquake: <i>but</i> the Lord is not in the earthquake.'
      v:012: '1KI:19:12 | 12 | 12 | And after the earthquake, a fire: but the Lord is not in the fire. And after the fire, a whistling of a gentle air.'
      v:013: '1KI:19:13 | 13 | 13 | And when Elias heard it, he covered his face with his mantle, and coming forth, stood in the entering in of the cave, and behold a voice unto him, saying: What dost thou here, Elias? And he answered:'
      v:014: '1KI:19:14 | 14 | 14 | With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord God of hosts: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant: they have destroyed thy altars, they have slain thy prophets with the sword; and I alone am left, and they seek my life to take it away.'
      v:015: '1KI:19:15 | 15 | 15 | And the Lord said to him: Go, and return on thy way, through the desert, to Damascus: and when thou art come thither, thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Syria;'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1KI:20:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>And.</i> The Roman Septuagint and Josephus place this war after the account of Naboth, chap. xxi. But the Alexandrian copy follows the order of the Hebrew. (Haydock) --- They style <i>Benadad,</i> "the son of Ader." He succeeded (ver. 34.) the king who attacked Baasa, chap. xv. 18. We know not the time nor the occasion of this war. (Calmet) --- Probably Achab had refused to pay tribute, and God had a mind to try if his obstinacy would yield to kindness, ver. 13., and 28. (Salien, the year before Christ 919.) --- <i>Kings.</i> Almost every city had one.'
      v:003:
        - '1KI:20:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Mine.</i> He had a desire to dispose of them, as he thought proper. Achab was willing to pay tribute, to remove the impending danger. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - '1KI:20:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Have.</i> Achab is not in earnest, but strives to pacify the barbarian. (Menochius)'
      v:006:
        - '1KI:20:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Servants,</i> or subjects. The king of Israel has thus a plea to interest all his people, as the danger was common. (Salien) --- He assumes the character of disinterestedness, as if he had been willing to abandon all his private property; knowing that Benadad would not accede even to that hard proposal. (Haydock) --- Thus "Nero consulted the first men of the city, whether they would prefer a doubtful war or a disgraceful peace." (Tacitus, An. xv.)'
      v:010:
        - '1KI:20:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Handfuls.</i> Hebrew <i>shohal.</i> The Septuagint, read "<i>shuhal</i>" and render it, "suffice for the foxes, for all the people, (even for) my infantry;" (Haydock) as if his forces were so numerous as to cover the whole land, and leave no room for even foxes to occupy. The hyperbole is equally great, supposing that his soldiers could by each taking a handful, or what might stick to his feet, (Chaldean) carry off all Samaria. Josephus intimates, that Benadad speaks of erecting terraces of equal height with the walls; others, that he would level the city with the ground, Ezechiel xxvi. 4. (Sanctius)'
      v:011:
        - '1KI:20:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Let not the girded,</i> &c. Let him not boast before the victory: it will then be time to glory when he putteth off his armour, having overcome his adversary. (Challoner) --- "Let not him who goes to battle, though well armed, boast; but the man who returns victorious." (Chaldean) "Enough: let not the man with a crooked back boast, as one that is upright." (Septuagint) "Let not him that girdeth, (Haydock) or is bound," (Hebrew) or rather "shutteth up, boast, as he that openeth." (Syriac) It is easy to besiege: but the city does not always fall. Neither people in arms, nor the unarmed, have reason to boast; as the former are often made prisoners, as soon as the latter. (Calmet) --- A despised enemy sometimes proves most dangerous. (Haydock) --- Those who distrust in themselves, and place their confidence in God, prevail: a necessary lesson both in temporal and spiritual warfare. (Worthington) --- The fortune of war is very doubtful. (Tirinus)'
      v:012:
        - '1KI:20:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Pavilions,</i> (<i>umbraculis</i>) or even under "the shade" of the trees, in full security. (Menochius) --- <i>Beset.</i> Hebrew, "set, and they set against the city." Chaldean, "hold yourselves in readiness, and they laid ambushes round the city." The siege had not been yet commenced in form, as it was never expected that Achab would dare to make any resistance.'
      v:013:
        - '1KI:20:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Prophet.</i> It does not appear who this and the other prophets were who address Achab so boldly during these wars; if indeed they were different persons: Elias is never mentioned. Did Jezabel leave the rest alone? or did these wars break out before she began to persecute them? (Calmet) --- Many suppose that the prophet, who spoke on this occasion, was Micheas. (Menochius) --- But Achab complains that he always brought him evil tidings, chap. xxii. 8. (Salien)'
      v:014:
        - '1KI:20:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Servants.</i> Literally, "footmen." (Haydock) --- Hebrew means either "sons or servants." The pages of honour, or the menial servants of the lords, were not likely to gain the victory. (Calmet) --- There were 232 in number, ver. 15. Achab followed them, (ver. 19.) with 7000; and this army defeated the Syrians. --- <i>Thou,</i> not in person; but thy men must begin the attack.'
      v:018:
        - '1KI:20:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Alive.</i> This he said out of contempt, and too great confidence; (Menochius) and this gave occasion to his defeat. For, while his men were endeavouring to execute his orders punctually, the Israelites cut many in pieces, and routed the rest. (Salien)'
      v:023:

(Menochius) --- Altars had also been erected to the true God on the most famous mountains. The law had been given at Sinai, and promulgated at Garizim. The late miracle at Carmel was known to all. Hence the pagans, (Calmet) conformably to their notions of assigning different parts of the creation to different gods, suspected that the god of Israel might preside only over the mountains. (Haydock) --- People are always ready to blame any but themselves. (Calmet) --- They lay the fault on fortune, &c. (Tirinus) --- The pride of Benadad could not bear to be told that his own temerity had brought on the defeat. (Haydock)'

A subterraneous fire and earthquake have caused the city to sink; and a lake, nine miles in circumference, now occupies its place. The ruins may still be discerned in its waters. It is about two hours walk from the plains of Balbec, (Paul Lucas. Levant i. 20.) at the foot of Libanus. The waters must be very thick and bituminous, if what is related by the ancients be true; namely, that the presents, offered to the Aphacite goddess, were tried by them, and deemed agreeable to her, if they sunk; as wool would do, while tiles, and often metals, would swim. (Calmet) --- Adrichomius places this Aphec on the great plain of Esdrelon, not far from Jezrahel. (Menochius)'

(Menochius) --- God caused the walls to fall, as he had done those of Jericho; or the Israelites beat them down with battering rams, and the defendants perished in the ruins. --- <i>Chamber.</i> Josephus observes that it was under ground.

(Josephus, [Antiquities?] viii. 14.) --- The son of Psammetichus, king of Egypt, was led in this manner to execution, with 2000 others. (Herodotus iii. 14.) --- Bessus was conducted to Alexander with a chain round his neck. (Curt. vii.) (Calmet) --- What a reverse of fortune do we here behold! (Salien)'

Allied kings style each other <i>brother;</i> those who are tributary, call themselves <i>servants,</i> (like Achaz, 4 Kings xvi. 7.; Calmet) as well as those who seek for favour; as Benadad does at present, ver. 32.

      v:034:
        - "1KI:20:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Thy father.</i> Benadad did not know the changes which had taken place in the royal family of Israel. He speaks of the cities which his predecessor had wrested from Baasa, chap. xv. 20. --- <i>Streets,</i> for merchants, of whom he would receive tribute: or military stations, as David had done, (2 Kings viii. 6.) to prevent any inroads. Benadad does not appear to have complied with these conditions, as the king of Israel had to take Ramath by force, chap. xxii. 2. --- <i>And having.</i> These words seem to be the conclusion of Benadad's proposition: but, according to the Hebrew, they contain Achab's reply. (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"Then <i>said Achab:</i> I will send thee away with this covenant.\" (Haydock) --- How generous does the conduct of Achab appear to the world! Yet it displeased God. (Salien) --- He severely punished this foolish pity towards a dangerous foe. (Worthington)"

        - '1KI:20:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Decreed.</i> Thou must either die or pay the money. (Menochius) --- Thus the king pronounced sentence against himself, as David had done, 2 Kings xii. 1., and xiv. 4. The Rabbins assert, that Achab had received an express order from God to destroy and subjugate all the Syrians. He ought, at least, to have been consulted, as he had given the enemy into the hands of the Israelites; (Calmet) and thus insinuated, that he would have them punished, (ver. 28.; Rupert v. 13.) for restricting his power to <i>the hills.</i> (Tirinus)'

      v:009: '1KI:20:9 | 9 | 9 | Wherefore he answered the messengers of Benadad: Tell my lord, the king: All that thou didst send for to me, thy servant, at first, I will do: but this thing I cannot do.'
      v:010: '1KI:20:10 | 10 | 10 | And the messengers returning brought him word. And he sent again, and said: Such and such things may the gods do to me, and more may they add, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.'
      v:011: '1KI:20:11 | 11 | 11 | And the king of Israel answering, said: Tell him: Let not the girded boast himself as the ungirded.'
      v:012: '1KI:20:12 | 12 | 12 | And it came to pass, when Benadad heard this word, that he and the kings were drinking in pavilions, and he said to his servants: Beset the city. And they beset it.'

      v:014: '1KI:20:14 | 14 | 14 | And Achab said: By whom? And he said to him: Thus saith the Lord: By the servants of the princes of the provinces. And he said: Who shall begin to fight? And he said: Thou.'

      v:016: '1KI:20:16 | 16 | 16 | And they went out at noon. But Benadad was drinking himself drunk in his pavilion, and the two and thirty kings with him, who were come to help him.'
      v:017: '1KI:20:17 | 17 | 17 | And the servants of the princes of the provinces went out first. And Benadad sent. And they told him, saying: There are men come out of Samaria.'

      v:019: '1KI:20:19 | 19 | 19 | So the servants of the princes of the provinces went out, and the rest of the army followed:'
      v:020: '1KI:20:20 | 20 | 20 | And every one slew the man that came against him: and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued after them. And Benadad, king of Syria, fled away on horseback with his horsemen.'
      v:021: '1KI:20:21 | 21 | 21 | But the king of Israel going out overthrew the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.'
      v:022: '1KI:20:22 | 22 | 22 | (And a prophet coming to the king of Israel, said to him: Go, and strengthen thyself, and know, and see what thou dost: for the next year the king of Syria will come up against thee.)'
      v:023: '1KI:20:23 | 23 | 23 | But the servants of the king of Syria said to him: Their gods are gods of the hills, therefore they have overcome us: but it is better that we should fight against them in the plains, and we shall overcome them.'
      v:024: '1KI:20:24 | 24 | 24 | Do thou, therefore, this thing: Remove all the kings from thy army, and put captains in their stead:'

      v:026: '1KI:20:26 | 26 | 26 | Wherefore, at the return of the year, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Benadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphec, to fight against Israel.'
      v:027: '1KI:20:27 | 27 | 27 | And the children of Israel were mustered, and taking victuals, went out on the other side, and encamped over-against them, like two little flocks of goats: but the Syrians filled the land.'
      v:028: '1KI:20:28 | 28 | 28 | (And a man of God coming, said to the king of Israel: Thus saith the Lord: Because the Syrians have said: The Lord is God of the hills, but is not God of the valleys: I will deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord.)'
      v:029: '1KI:20:29 | 29 | 29 | And both sides set their armies in array one against the other seven days, and on the seventh day the battle was fought: and the children of Israel slew, of the Syrians, a hundred thousand footmen in one day.'
      v:030: '1KI:20:30 | 30 | 30 | And they that remained fled to Aphec, into the city: and the wall fell upon seven and twenty thousand men, that were left. And Benadad, fleeing went into the city, into a chamber that was within a chamber.'
      v:031: '1KI:20:31 | 31 | 31 | And his servants said to him: Behold, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful; so let us put sackcloths on our loins, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: perhaps he will save our lives.'
      v:032: '1KI:20:32 | 32 | 32 | So they girded sackcloths on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said to him: Thy servant, Benadad, saith: I beseech thee let me have my life. And he said: If he be yet alive, he is my brother.'
      v:033: '1KI:20:33 | 33 | 33 | The men took this for good luck: and in haste caught the word out of his mouth, and said: Thy brother Benadad. And he said to them: Go, and bring him to me. Then Benadad came out to him, and he lifted him up into his chariot.'
      v:034: '1KI:20:34 | 34 | 34 | And he said to him: The cities which my father took from thy father, I will restore: and do thou make thee streets in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria, and having made a league, I will depart from thee. So he made a league with him, and let him go.'
      v:035: '1KI:20:35 | 35 | 35 | Then a certain man of the sons of the prophets, said to his companion, in the word of the Lord: Strike me. But he would not strike.'
      v:036: '1KI:20:36 | 36 | 36 | Then he said to him: Because thou wouldst not hearken to the word of the Lord, behold thou shalt depart from me, and a lion shall slay thee. And when he was gone a little from him, a lion found him, and slew him.'
      v:037: '1KI:20:37 | 37 | 37 | Then he found another man, and said to him: Strike me. And he struck him and wounded him.'
      v:038: '1KI:20:38 | 38 | 38 | So the prophet went, and met the king in the way, and disguised himself by sprinkling dust on his face and his eyes.'
      v:039: '1KI:20:39 | 39 | 39 | And as the king passed by, he cried to the king, and said: Thy servant went out to fight hand to hand: and when a certain man was run away, one brought him to me, and said: Keep this man: and if he shall slip away, thy life shall be for his life, or thou shalt pay a talent of silver.'
      v:040: '1KI:20:40 | 40 | 40 | And whilst I, in a hurry, turned this way and that, on a sudden he was not to be seen. And the king of Israel said to him: This is thy judgment, which thyself hast decreed.'

Josephus calls the place Azari, and says it was a field contiguous to the king's <i>palace.</i> Septuagint {GREEK:START alo}αλο{GREEK:END}, \"threshing-floor.\""
      v:002:
        - "1KI:21:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Herbs.</i> The taste of eastern nations is very different from ours. The Syrians delight in seeing gardens filled with melons, onions, &c., and they cannot conceive what pleasure we can find in rambling round our long walks for the sake of exercise. --- <i>Money.</i> Hence we perceive that, notwithstanding the despotic power of the kings of Israel, they did not imagine that they had a <i>right</i> to take their subjects' lands, 1 Kings viii. 14. (Calmet) --- Naboth's conduct is therefore here applauded; and St. Ambrose (Off. iii. 9.) styles him a martyr, (Worthington) and a great <i>saint.</i> (Tirinus) --- <i>Maluit periculum cum honestate, quam utilitatem cum opprobrio.</i>"

The law of Moses was till in force; and there were some, like Naboth, who were resolved to comply with it, (Calmet) even at the hazard of their lives. (Tirinus)'
      v:004:
        - "1KI:21:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Fretting.</i> The Hebrew terms are the same as [in] chap. xx. 43. What weakness in Achab! Riches and honours are not capable of ensuring content. (Calmet) --- \"Who, thinkest thou, is poor; the man who is content with his own, or he who covets another's property?\" (St. Ambrose, Naboth ii.) --- <i>Wall,</i> as Ezechias did afterwards, in very different dispositions; though both were oppressed with grief, Isaias xxxviii. 2.

        - '1KI:21:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Chief men.</i> Hebrew <i>chorim,</i> "those in white," the usual colour of magistrates and noblemen, Ecclesiastes ix. 8., and Daniel vii. 9. The angels generally appear arrayed in white. Among the Egyptians and the Greeks, the rich were remarkable for the whiteness of their robes. (Herodotus ii. 36.) (Homer, Odyssey <em><u>Z</u></em>.)'
      v:009:
        - '1KI:21:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Fast,</i> as in a case of the greatest importance, where the welfare of the king and of the state are concerned. We have frequent mention of such extraordinary fasts, 2 Paralipomenon xx. 3., 1 Esdras viii. 21., and Joel i. 14, &c. Some would translated, "Call an assembly." (Vatable) --- But the Chaldean, &c., are for the fast. Josephus joins both. All the people were collected, (Calmet) and Naboth was (Hebrew) "set on high, or at the head, as president, on account of his riches and nobility, (Haydock) that he might be unprepared, and afterwards be more disgraced. (Menochius) Abulensis (q. 4.) thinks that the judges were accustomed to fast, to shew their pity for the criminal, and that they were moved only by a zeal for justice.'
      v:010:
        - "1KI:21:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Belial,</i> without restraint or conscience. --- <i>Blasphemed.</i> Hebrew, \"blessed.\" --- <i>Elohim,</i> (Haydock) or god, the gods, magistrates, &c. (Calmet) --- Blessing is equally put, to avoid the horrible sound of blaspheming. (Worthington) (Job i. 5., and ii. 9.) --- Martin de Roa (i. 9.) maintains, that the word implies to \"bid adieu,\" or quit; as if Naboth had relinquished the service both of God and of the king. He was accused as a traitor. The law did not condemn the person to death who had spoken ill of the prince, Exodus xxii. 28. But the wicked judges complied with the intimation of Jezabel; (Calmet) as she pretended that he had also blasphemed God. (Haydock) --- Josephus introduces three witnesses, which was more conformable to the practice of the Jews. (Grotius) --- But the text specifies <i>two;</i> and that number would suffice. (Haydock) --- All Naboth's family were involved in his ruin; (4 Kings ix. 26.; Tirinus) as it was necessary for Achab's purpose. So Achan's children perished with him, Josue vii. 25. (Haydock) --- What a complication of crimes! (Tirinus) --- \"They proclaim a fast, in order to commit murder.\" (St. Chrysostom, ser. 68.) Hypocrisy, falsehoods, perjury, perversion of justice, all are employed to take away the life, honour, and property of the innocent. See St. Ambrose, Seneca Benef. ii. 27. (Tirinus)"

Some assert, that Naboth was Achab's uncle. But this wants proof. (Calmet) --- Achab only waited one day, and then Elias met him to denounce to him a similar fate after he <i>was dead,</i> 4 Kings ix. 26. Septuagint have, \"he tore his garments, and put on sackcloth; and it came to pass afterwards, that Achab arose,\" &c. This addition would intimate that the king pretended to be sorry. They repeat the same thing, ver. 27., \"he had put on sackcloth, on the day when he slew Naboth, and went along <i>cast down.</i>\" It is probable that Achab might assume this garb, to make people suppose that he had no hand in the death of Naboth; but this was all hypocrisy, and Elias boldly accused him of guilt. <i>Thou hast slain,</i> &c., ver. 19. (Haydock) --- He knew, at least, of his wife's machinations. (Salien)"

(Menochius) --- But Naboth's vineyard, perhaps, was not far distant from the <i>pool,</i> where dogs licked the blood of the king. (Haydock) --- On account of Achab's repentance, the sentence was (ver. 29.; Calmet) rather changed, and his son Joram was substituted in his stead, 4 Kings ix. 25. Jehu, and his captain, Badacer, were present, when Elias denounced this judgment upon the family of Achab; and they concluded that the prediction regarded Joram. He had, perhaps, taken part with his impious parents, and promoted the same crimes. (Haydock)"

        - '1KI:21:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Thy enemy.</i> Have I done thee any harm, whenever thou hast appeared before me? Hebrew and Septuagint, "O my enemy." (Haydock) --- <i>To find,</i> often means to attack or take by surprise. Art thou come thus, to fall upon me on the road? (Calmet) --- <i>Sold.</i> That is, so addicted to evil, as if thou hadst sold thyself to the devil, to be his slave to work all kind of evil. (Challoner) (Worthington) (St. Gregory, in Ezec. hom. 10.) --- The expression strongly marks the empire of the passions. Achab was sovereignly wicked, without any restraint. (Calmet) --- So Vitellius was: <i>Luxui saginæque mancipatus, emptusque.</i> (Tacitus, Hist. ii.) --- <i>Sold,</i> or "abandoned," are used in the same sense, Psalm xliii. 13.'
      v:021:
        - '1KI:21:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Wall.</i> See 1 Kings xxv. 22. --- <i>Israel,</i> chap. xiv. 10. (Menochius)'
      v:022:
        - 1KI:21:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Sin.</i> god frequently inculcates the enormity of the crime of public scandal. (Menochius)
      v:023:
        - '1KI:21:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Field.</i> Hebrew, "wall," <i>or</i> "before the wall." This was exactly fulfilled, 4 Kings ix. 32. Jezabel was hurled from a window over the gate or wall of the city. (Calmet)'
      v:024:
        - "1KI:21:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Eat him.</i> Yet God remitted something from the severity of this sentence; and Achab was buried in Samaria, chap. xxii. 37. But his son was deprived of burial. (Tirinus) (4 Kings ix. 26.) --- According to the Hebrew, the prediction related to Achab's posterity, as the Chaldean, Septuagint, Syriac, &c., have understood it. (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"him that dieth of Achab in the city,\" &c."
      v:025:
        - '1KI:21:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Now.</i> Septuagint, "Moreover, Achab was foolishly sold, a man who was sold, &c., since Jezabel....changed him:" {GREEK:START metetheken}μητηθηκην{GREEK:END}. His natural disposition was not perhaps so bad. But his unfortunate connexion with a most wicked wife involved him in ruin. Even when he began to relent, and was on the point of reforming his life, (ver. 27.) her influence spoiled all. (Haydock) --- He was sold to her, and she exercised a most severe tyranny over him, using his seal at pleasure, and treating him with indignity, ver. 7, 8. (Tirinus)'
      v:026:
        - '1KI:21:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Amorrhites.</i> The Sidonians still adored the idols Baal and Astaroth, with the utmost exertions of cruelty and lust. This was the religion which Achab wished to establish, more than any of his predecessors. (Calmet)'
      v:027:
        - '1KI:21:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Down.</i> Hebrew, "uncovered," (Malvenda; 2 Kings xv. 30.) or "barefoot," (Chaldean; Syriac) or "softly," (Vatable; Protestants) or "he walked bent down." (Septuagint) This variety shows that the signification or <i>at</i> (Haydock) is not well known. The repentance of Achab is not more certain. Some believe that it was insincere, and only external: yet God was pleased to reward it iin this life, (Lyranus; Theodoret, &c.) as it might have some influence on the people. (Haydock) --- Others suppose that Achab really repented for what he had done, but presently relapsed at the instigation of Jezabel; so that his reward was equally of a temporal nature; though St. Chrysostom (ad Theod. laps.) seems to be convinced that he "obtained the remission of all his sins, and entirely changed his life." (ser. 68, et hom. 5. ad Antioc.) --- But here lies the difficulty. (Calmet) --- "His groans would have found favour, if the lurking envy had not increased his offence." (St. Ambrose, in Psalm xxxvii., de Naboth. chap. iv.) See ver. 25. --- A relapse renders the sincerity of the former conversions doubtful; and the more so, when no radical change, but only external sorrow, has appeared.'
      v:029:
        - '1KI:21:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Sake.</i> Hebrew, "before me," publicly. (Haydock) --- The threat of the prophet caused Achab to invest his son with the royal dignity, and Josaphat followed his example. (Salien, the year before Christ 916.) --- But some call this in question. (Haydock)'

      v:001: '1KI:21:1 | 1 | 1 | And {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}after these things, Naboth the Jezrahelite, who was in Jezrahel, had at that time a vineyard, near the palace of Achab, king of Samaria.'
      v:002: '1KI:21:2 | 2 | 2 | And Achab spoke to Naboth, saying: Give me thy vineyard, that I may make me a garden of herbs, because it is nigh, and adjoining to my house; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard: or if thou think it more convenient for thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.'
      v:003: '1KI:21:3 | 3 | 3 | Naboth answered him: The Lord be merciful to me, and not let me give thee the inheritance of my fathers.'
      v:004: '1KI:21:4 | 4 | 4 | And Achab came into his house angry and fretting, because of the word that Naboth, the Jezrahelite, had spoken to him, saying: I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And casting himself upon his bed, he turned away his face to the wall, and would eat no bread.'
      v:005: '1KI:21:5 | 5 | 5 | And Jezabel, his wife, went in to him, and said to him: What is the matter that thy soul is so grieved? and why eatest thou no bread?'
      v:006: '1KI:21:6 | 6 | 6 | And he answered her: I spoke to Naboth, the Jezrahelite, and said to him: Give me thy vineyard, and take money for it: or if it please thee, I will give thee a better vineyard for it. And he said: I will not give thee my vineyard.'
      v:007: '1KI:21:7 | 7 | 7 | Then Jezabel, his wife, said to him: Thou art of great authority indeed, and governest well the kingdom of Israel. Arise, and eat bread, and be of good cheer; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezrahelite.'
      v:008: "1KI:21:8 | 8 | 8 | So she wrote letter's in Achab's name, and sealed them with his ring, and sent them to the ancients, and the chief men that were in his city, and that dwelt with Naboth."
      v:009: '1KI:21:9 | 9 | 9 | And this was the tenor of the letters: Proclaim a fast, and make Naboth sit among the chief of the people;'
      v:010: '1KI:21:10 | 10 | 10 | And suborn two men, sons of Belial, against him, and let them bear false witness; that he hath blasphemed God and the king: and then carry him out, and stone him, and so let him die.'
      v:011: '1KI:21:11 | 11 | 11 | And the men of his city, the ancients and nobles, that dwelt with him in the city, did as Jezabel had commanded them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them;'
      v:012: '1KI:21:12 | 12 | 12 | They proclaimed a fast, and made Naboth sit among the chief of the people.'
      v:013: '1KI:21:13 | 13 | 13 | And bringing two men, sons of the devil, they made them sit against him: and they, like men of the devil, bore witness against him before the people: saying: Naboth hath blasphemed God and the king. Wherefore they brought him forth without the city, and stoned him to death.'
      v:014: '1KI:21:14 | 14 | 14 | And they sent to Jezabel, saying: Naboth is stoned, and is dead.'
      v:015: '1KI:21:15 | 15 | 15 | And it came to pass, when Jezabel heard that Naboth was stoned, and dead, that she said to Achab: Arise, and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezrahelite, who would not agree with thee, and give it thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.'
      v:016: '1KI:21:16 | 16 | 16 | And when Achab heard this, to wit, that Naboth was dead, he arose, and went down into the vineyard of Naboth, the Jezrahelite, to take possession of it.'
      v:017: '1KI:21:17 | 17 | 17 | And the word of the Lord came to Elias, the Thesbite, saying:'
      v:018: '1KI:21:18 | 18 | 18 | Arise, and go down to meet Achab, king of Israel, who is in Samaria: behold he is going down to the vineyard of Naboth, to take possession of it:'
      v:019: '1KI:21:19 | 19 | 19 | And thou shalt speak to him, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast slain: moreover also thou hast taken possession. And after these words thou shalt add: Thus saith the Lord: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}In this place, wherein the dogs have licked the blood of Naboth, they shall lick thy blood also.'
      v:020: '1KI:21:20 | 20 | 20 | And Achab said to Elias: Hast thou found me thy enemy? He said: I have found thee, because thou art sold to do evil in the sight of the Lord.'
      v:021: '1KI:21:21 | 21 | 21 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Behold I will bring evil upon thee, and I will cut down thy posterity, and I will kill of Achab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up, and the last in Israel.'
      v:022: '1KI:21:22 | 22 | 22 | And I will make thy house like the {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and like the house of {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 1}Baasa the son of Ahias: for what thou hast done to provoke me to anger, and for making Israel to sin.'
      v:023: '1KI:21:23 | 23 | 23 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And of Jezabel also, the Lord spoke, saying: The dogs shall eat Jezabel in the field of Jezrahel.'
      v:024: '1KI:21:24 | 24 | 24 | If Achab die in the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die in the field, the birds of the air shall eat him.'
      v:025: '1KI:21:25 | 25 | 25 | Now, there was not such another as Achab, who was sold to do evil in the sight of the Lord: for his wife, Jezabel, set him on,'
      v:026: '1KI:21:26 | 26 | 26 | And he became abominable, insomuch that he followed the idols which the Amorrhites had made, whom the Lord destroyed before the face of the children of Israel.'
      v:027: '1KI:21:27 | 27 | 27 | And when Achab had heard these words, he rent his garments, and put hair-cloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and slept in sackcloth, and walked with his head cast down.'
      v:028: '1KI:21:28 | 28 | 28 | And the word of the Lord came to Elias, the Thesbite, saying:'
      v:029: "1KI:21:29 | 29 | 29 | Hast thou not seen Achab humbled before me? therefore, because he hath humbled himself, for my sake, I will not bring the evil in his days, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house."

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1KI:22:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Israel,</i> from the time when Benadad and Achab had made a league, chap. xx. 34.'
      v:002:
        - '1KI:22:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Josaphat.</i> It is wonderful that a prince of so great piety, should be on terms of such strict friendship with a most wicked king. God did not approve of it; and the event was unfortunate, 2 Paralipomenon xx. 37. Achab received the king of Juda with extraordinary magnificence, 2 Paralipomenon xviii. 2. It is thought that (Calmet) the latter had married his daughter, (Grotius) or rather (Haydock) he had taken Athalia for his son Joram, 2 Paralipomenon xviii. 1. (Tirinus) (Menochius)'
      v:003:
        - '1KI:22:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Syria.</i> Benadad had not restored it; either because he no longer regarded his treaty, or because the city had not been taken by his <i>father.</i> (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - '1KI:22:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>One,</i> in concord, (Haydock) and ready to march against the same enemy. --- <i>Lord.</i> This was rather late, if (Menochius) the army was already receiving its pay under the walls of Samaria. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] viii. 15.) --- God ought to have been consulted at first. (Menochius)'
      v:006:
        - '1KI:22:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Men,</i> probably the prophets of the groves, who had not gone to Carmel, chap. xviii. 19, 22. (Calmet) --- The recent slaughter had not deterred others from imitating the example of the false prophets. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - '1KI:22:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Lord.</i> Josaphat knew that these four hundred were addicted to idol worship, (Haydock) and suspected that they only flattered their king. (Josephus)'
      v:008:
        - '1KI:22:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>One man.</i> Perhaps Micheas alone resided at Samaria. Elias and his disciples were in the country. Josephus and some others think, (Calmet) that the son of Jemla had been cast into prison for what he had said to Achab, when he had dismissed the king of Syria, chap. xx. 43. (Haydock) --- <i>Not so.</i> Good advice should be followed, though it be not pleasant. (Menochius) --- Josaphat justly suspected the schismatical false prophets. (Worthington)'
      v:009:
        - '1KI:22:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Eunuch.</i> Hebrew <i>saris,</i> denotes also "a servant;" or Achab might have purchased this stranger.'
      v:010:
        - '1KI:22:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Court,</i> or barn floor. They were in or near cities, that they might be so protected from the incursions of enemies, who strove to set the corn on fire, 1 Kings xxiii. 1., and Judges xv. 5.'
      v:011:
        - '1KI:22:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Push,</i> "with the horn," ({GREEK:START keratiseis}κηρατισηισ{GREEK:END}; Septuagint) and throw into the air, (Menochius) like a bull. (Calmet) --- Nothing shall withstand thy power. The actions of Sedecias were of the same import as his words. (Haydock) --- See Jeremias xxvii. 2., and xxviii. 10. --- Such horns were shewn to Zacharias; (i. 18.) as false prophets often do, like the true ones. (Worthington)'
      v:015:
        - '1KI:22:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Go up,</i> &c. This was spoken ironically, and by way of jesting at the flattering speeches of the false prophets: and so the king understood it, as appears by his adjuring Micheas, in the following verse, to tell him the truth in the name of the Lord. (Challoner) --- Micheas had only repeated their words, and by his accent and gestures (Du Hamel) might easily explain his meaning. (Haydock) --- Similar examples of irony may be seen, chap. xviii. 27., and Genesis iii. 22. (Calmet) --- The prophet might also pray for success. But the king begged for a positive answer. (Worthington)'
      v:017:
        - '1KI:22:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>No shepherd....no master,</i> clearly intimated (Menochius) that the king should perish in the battle. Paralipomenon reads: <i>These have no masters.</i> (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - "1KI:22:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>He,</i> Micheas, <i>added,</i> (Menochius) not fearing the king's displeasure, who seemed to regard his former denunciation as an effect of his ill-will. Hence he explains his vision more at large. God often conforms to our ideas, and even prejudices. The people were then accustomed to look upon him as a king, environed with his army of good and evil spirits; the one at his right-hand, to execute his designs of mercy, and the other at his left, to execute his judgments. Job (i. 6, 12.) speaks in the like manner. We know that God stands in need of no counsellors; (Romans xi. 34.) and that the angels of satan have no place in heaven, Isaias xiv. 12., Apocalypse xii. 9., and Jude 6."
      v:020:
        - '1KI:22:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>The Lord said,</i> &c. God standeth not in need of any counsellor; nor are we suppose, that things pass in heaven in the manner here described: but this representation was made to the prophet, to be delivered by him in a manner adopted to the common ways and notions of men. (Challoner) (St. Gregory, Mor. ii. 21., &c.) (Worthington) --- God did not enable the king to discern the falsehood. (Bellarmine ii. 13. Grat. Amis.)'
      v:022:
        - '1KI:22:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Go forth, and do so.</i> This was not a command, but a permission; for God never ordaineth lies, though he often permitteth the lying spirit to deceive those who love not the truth, 2 Thessalonians ii. 10. And in this sense it is said in the following verse, <i>the Lord hath given a lying spirit in the mouth of all thy prophets.</i> (Challoner) --- What is translated in the <i>imperative,</i> denotes frequently what will come to pass, though it be displeasing to God. (Calmet) --- He permits it, therefore, only by not exerting his power to prevent the execution. (Haydock) --- The devils can do nothing without such a permission. Achab deserved to be deceived by the false prophets, as he would not hearken to a true one. (St. Augustine, contra Jul. v. 4., and q. 53. inter. 83.)'
      v:024:
        - "1KI:22:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Cheek.</i> Josephus says he had told the king, that if his hand did not wither, like that of Jeroboam, he might conclude that Micheas was a false prophet; particularly as his prediction was at variance with that of Elias; who had asserted that Achab should die at Jezrahel, while Micheas seemed to condemn him to death at Ramoth. But these circumstances are by no means certain, though they be adopted by the author of the Scholastic History, by Lyranus, &c. (Calmet) --- If Sedecias had the assurance to make such a declaration, God was not obliged to work a miracle to prevent the king's mistake; and Micheas had never said that Achab should die at Ramoth. (Haydock) --- <i>Hath.</i> In 2 Paralipomenon xviii. 23, it is expressed, <i>Which way went the spirit of the Lord from me to speak to thee?</i> If he could have proved that he had ever possessed the spirit, he might have spoken with some confidence; though sin may easily banish him. Thus Catholics may ask the pretended reformers, who boast of the spirit, how He came to abandon the Church with which all agree He once resided, to establish a contrary one? The spirit of God cannot be at variance with himself, nor reveal contradictory things. (Haydock)"
      v:025:
        - '1KI:22:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Go into a chamber,</i> &c. This happened when he heard the king was slain, and justly apprehended that he should be punished for his false prophecy; (Challoner) though this be nowhere recorded, (Calmet) except in Josephus. (Worthington) --- He probably escaped death. (Salien)'
      v:027:
        - '1KI:22:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Distress,</i> both "in small quantity," (Paralipomenon) and very bad. (Grotius) (Tirinus) (Isaias xxx. 20.) --- <i>Peace,</i> when I will punish thee, as an impostor. (Menochius) --- How grating must this have been to the good king Josaphat; and still he does not abandon the company of such infatuated <i>people!</i> (Ver. 29.) (Haydock)'
      v:030:
        - '1KI:22:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Thy own.</i> Septuagint, "I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; and do thou put on my garment." Hence the Syrians mistook Josaphat for Achab, (ver. 32.; Calmet) as "it had been agreed between them, that he should wear the robes of Achab, to elude more easily the prediction of Micheas." (Josephus, [Antiquities?] viii. 15.) --- Vain and impious attempt! Providence found him out, though unadorned. (Haydock) --- Achab might pretend thus to honour the king of Juda! (Menochius) and perhaps he had been apprized of the order given to the Syrians, to single him out, ver. 31. What could prompt such an order, cannot be easily ascertained. Benadad might wish to revenge himself, for being brought out as a prisoner to Achab; or he might be informed of the prediction of Micheas.'
      v:031:
        - '1KI:22:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Captains of,</i> or mounted "on chariots." There would hardly be so many general officers over the chariots alone. The same number of kings had been in a former engagement, and they had been replaced by these captains, chap. xx. 24. (Calmet) --- <i>Only.</i> Not that the Syrians were to avoid hurting any body else, as they could not thus come at the king; (Salien) and we find one shot an arrow at the army of Israel; (ver. 34.; Haydock) but the main onset was to be directed against Achab, either to kill or to take him prisoner. (Menochius)'
      v:032:
        - '1KI:22:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Cried out.</i> Paralipomenon add, <i>to the Lord, and he helped him, and turned them away from him.</i> The Jews (in Seder. Olam xvii.) acknowledge the same thing; and thus it was known that Josaphat was not the king of Israel, who would rather have invoked Baal. (Menochius) --- Perhaps he also declared the truth, and who he was, when he saw the Syrians surround him, crying, <i>This is the king of Israel!</i> (2 Paralipomenon xviii. 31.) (Tirinus)'
      v:034:
        - '1KI:22:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Stomach.</i> Paralipomenon<i>, between the neck and the shoulders.</i> The arrow went in at the lungs, and came out at the shoulders, as it was shot from a lower ground. (Menochius) --- Some explain the Hebrew, "between the joints and the coat of mail." Protestants, "joints of the harness." Septuagint, "between the lungs and the thorax." (Haydock) --- Syriac, "between the juncture of the coat of mail," where it is connected with the armour of the thighs. (Grotius) --- God directed the random shot. (Salien) (Worthington) --- <i>Hand.</i> It was deemed unbecoming for the king to touch the reins. (Diodorus, Sic. xvii.; Brisson iii. p. 383.)'
      v:035:
        - '1KI:22:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Evening.</i> Achab had only retired to the hinder ranks, while Josaphat, by his valour, maintained the day, till the death of the former put an end to the war.'
      v:038:
        - "1KI:22:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Of Samaria.</i> Josephus says, of Jezara, (Jezrahel) conformably to the prediction. But God had relented in that particular, on Achab's repentance; (Calmet; Chap. xxi. 24, 29.) unless it regarded his son Joram. (Haydock) (Salien) --- <i>Reins.</i> Hebrew <i>zonoth,</i> may also signify \"arms,\" (Munster) and \"harlots.\" (Septuagint) Some suspect that such were painted on the chariot. Josephus intimates, with the Septuagint, that \"harlots bathed in the blood,\" (Antiquities viii. 15.) which would tend to the greater contempt of Achab. (Menochius) --- <i>Spoken,</i> respecting dogs licking up Achab's blood. No mention had been made of the chariot. God was thus pleased to shew how easily he could have executed the sentence in all its rigour."
      v:039:
        - '1KI:22:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Of ivory.</i> The palace was greatly adorned with it, (see Amos iii. 15., and Psalm xliv. 9.; Calmet) like the throne of Solomon, chap. x. 18. Pliny (xvi. 43.) speaks of bedsteads and vehicles of ivory, in the same sense. (Tirinus)'
      v:044:
        - '1KI:22:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>He took not away,</i> &c. He left some of the high places, viz., those in which they worshipped the true God: but took away all others, 2 Paralipomenon xvii. 6; (Challoner) and even those also, before the end of his reign; (Calmet) as they were contrary to the law. (Menochius) --- Others think that the passage in Paralipomenon is incorrect; <i>ula</i> being substituted for <i>vaud. He took away the high places,</i> (chap. xix. 3.) <i>and the groves.</i> (Grotius) (Capell.) --- We know that such remained in the days of Joas; and Josaphat in not ranked among the irreproachable kings, Ecclesiasticus xlix. 5. (Calmet) --- He attempted perhaps to remove those places, but was prevented by the people. (Menochius) See chap. xv. 14.'

Under Ochozias, the son of Josaphat, the kings of Edom became independent, 4 Kings viii. 20. (Calmet) --- Hitherto they had paid tribute. (Menochius)'

        - '1KI:22:49 | 49 | 49 | <i>Made.</i> Hebrew incorrectly reads <i>hasar,</i> "ten," instead of <i>hasa,</i> "made;" (Calmet) which the Protestants follow, "made ships of Tharshish, to go to Ophir." (Haydock) See chap. ix. 26., and 28.'

        - '1KI:22:50 | 50 | 50 | <i>Would not.</i> He had been reprehended before for admitting such a partner: and therefore would have no more to do with him. (Challoner) --- They had formerly joined in equipping such a fleet, (2 Paralipomenon xx. 36., and 37.; Calmet) and it had been dashed to pieces in the very port. (Haydock)'
      v:052:
        - '1KI:22:52 | 52 | 52 | <i>Years,</i> not complete; as the first is comprized in the reign of Achab, and the last in that of Joram, 4 Kings iii. 1. (Usher, the year of the world 3108.) --- Yet, his very short reign was memorable for many disasters; the revolt of the dependant king of Moab, the ruin of his navy, &c., that he might thus be reclaimed from his evil ways. (Salien, the year before Christ 915.) --- Houbigant allows this king two full years; and rejects the notion of his being associated by his father, as he does on other similar occasions, where the Scripture is silent. He makes Ochozias commence in the 19th, and end in the 22d of Josaphat, and not in the second of Joram, 4 Kings i. 17. The Hebrew and Greek copies vary. (Haydock)'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "This and the following Book are called by the holy Fathers, The Third and Fourth Book of Kings; but by the Hebrews, the First and Second. They contain the history of the kingdoms of Israel and Juda, from the beginning of the reign of Solomon to the captivity. As to the writer of these books, it seems most probable they were not written by one man, nor at one time; but as there was all along a succession of prophets in Israel, who recorded, by divine inspiration, the most remarkable things that happened in their days, these books seem to have been written by these prophets. See 2 Paralipomenon, alias 2 Chronicles ix. 29., xii. 15., xiii. 22., xx. 34., xxvi. 22., and xxxii. 32. (Challoner) --- This book informs us of the death of David, chap. ii. 11, where some Greek copies concluded the second book \"of the reigns or kingdoms,\" as they style all the four books. Theodoret and Diodorus follow this division. The point is of no consequence; and the Hebrew editions have often varied. Origen observes, that the Jews denoted these two books from the first words, \"Ouammelech David.\" (Eusebius, Hist. vi. 25.) (Haydock) --- In St. Jerome's time, the four books made only two. The present book details the actions of Solomon, (Calmet) till the end of the 12th chapter. Then we behold the division of the kingdom: Roboam, Abias, Asa, and Josaphat, reign over Juda; Jeroboam, &c., over Israel; while the prophets Abias, Elias, Eliseus, appear in the remaining eleven chapters. (Worthington) --- Though the memoirs seem to have been left by contemporary authors, (Haydock) one, and most probably Esdras, made the compilation, after the captivity, inserting frequently the very words of his authors, yet so as to make some additional reflections. (Calmet) --- The Rabbins generally attribute the work to Jeremias. (Haydock) --- He is more attentive to the house of David, and to display the rewards of piety, and the punishment of vice, as well as the glory of the temple and of religion, than to describe the military exploits, which occupy so much of the profane history. (Calmet)"
