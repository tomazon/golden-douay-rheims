      v:001:
        - 'NEH:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Words,</i> or transactions written by <i>Nehemias.</i> (Menochius) --- <i>Helcias,</i> or Hebrew and Septaugint, "Chelcias." --- <i>Casleu,</i> the third of the civil year, 1 Esdras x. 9. --- <i>Year</i> of Artaxerxes, (Calmet) after he was associated with his father on the throne; (Tirinus) or rather the death of Xerxes. From this period the seventy weeks of Daniel are dated, (Du Hamel) or from the 23rd of Artaxerxes, and the 28th of Xerxes, (Tirinus) as above three years must have been consumed in making preparations for the walls, &c. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xi. 5.) --- The name of Nehemias, "comforter of God," as well as his being <i>sent</i> by a king to <i>build,</i> &c., prefigured Jesus Christ, sent by God to comfort and establish his Church. (Ven. Bede) (Worthington) (Haydock) --- <i>Susa.</i> Hebrew, "in Susa, the palace," where the kings of Persia resided in the months of winter, (Athen. xii. 1.) and of spring. (Xenophon) (Cyr. viii.) (Curt. v. 8.) --- Here Darius probably kept his court at other times, Esther i. 2. (Calmet) --- Susa was situated on the river Coaspes, between the provinces of Babylon and Persia. (Du Hamel)'
      v:002:
        - 'NEH:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Hanani,</i> a relation, whom Nehemias brought back, chap. vii. 2. --- <i>Came.</i> Some Latin copies add, "to me," (Lyranus) as if a deputation had been sent; but of this the text is silent. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'NEH:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Province</i> of Judea, subject to the Persians, as it was afterwards to the Romans; though, at present, they were allowed to have governors of their own nation. (Menochius) --- <i>Reproach,</i> on account of the surrounding enemies. (Haydock) --- <i>Fire,</i> recently; (Menochius. See 1 Esdras iv. 12., and ix. 9.) or rather by Nabuchodonosor; as the kings of Persia would not suffer the city to be fortified, for fear of a fresh rebellion. (Lyranus) (Tirinus) --- We find that little progress (chap. iii., and iv.; Calmet) had at least been made in the work, though the blame must rather be laid on the enemies of Israel, than on several of the kings of Persia, who seem to have authorized the undertaking, which Cambyses, or Smerdis, had for a time interrupted. They only specify, indeed, that leave was granted to build the <i>temple.</i> But they allowed them to erect houses for themselves, which could not have been done to any purpose, among so many enemies, unless they had been defended by some sort of fortifications. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'NEH:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Days;</i> about four months, till Nisan. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'NEH:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>They.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "we have sinned." (Menochius)'
      v:007:
        - 'NEH:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Vanity.</i> Hebrew, "we have been corrupted." (Vatable) "we have dealt very corruptly." (Protestants) (Haydock) --- The author of the Vulgate has read <i>e</i> for <i>é</i><i>.</i> (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "we have been very dissolute, <i>or</i> weak."'
      v:009:
        - 'NEH:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>World.</i> Literally, "of heaven, <i>or</i> the sky," (Haydock) which seems to the vulgar (Calmet) to rest upon the horizon. (Tirinus) See Deuteronomy xxx. 4.'
      v:010:
        - 'NEH:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Redeemed,</i> or liberated from great evils. (Menochius)'
      v:011:
        - 'NEH:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Man;</i> (<i>virum</i>) the great king, (Haydock) Artaxerxes. (Calmet) --- <i>Cup-bearer;</i> Athersatha, 1 Esdras ii. 63., and 2 Esdras vii. 65.'

    verses:
      v:001: 'NEH:1:1 | 1 | 1 | The {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}words of Nehemias, the son of Helchias. And it came to pass in the month of Casleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in the castle of Susa,'
      v:002: 'NEH:1:2 | 2 | 2 | That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and some men of Juda; and I asked them concerning the Jews, that remained and were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.'
      v:003: 'NEH:1:3 | 3 | 3 | And they said to me: They that have remained, and are left of the captivity there in the province, are in great affliction and reproach: and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.'
      v:004: 'NEH:1:4 | 4 | 4 | And when I had heard these words, I sat down, and wept, and mourned for many days: and I fasted, and prayed before the face of the God of heaven.'
      v:005: 'NEH:1:5 | 5 | 5 | And I said: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven, strong, great, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy with those that love thee, and keep thy commandments:'
      v:006: "NEH:1:6 | 6 | 6 | Let thy ears be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, night and day, for the children of Israel, thy servants: and I confess the sins of the children of Israel, by which they have sinned against thee: I and my father's house have sinned."
      v:007: 'NEH:1:7 | 7 | 7 | We have been seduced by vanity, and have not kept thy commandments, and ceremonies, and judgments, which thou hast commanded thy servant, Moses.'
      v:008: 'NEH:1:8 | 8 | 8 | Remember the word that thou commandedst to Moses, thy servant, saying: If you shall transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:'
      v:009: 'NEH:1:9 | 9 | 9 | But if you return to me, and keep my commandments, and do them, though you should be led away to the uttermost parts of the world, I will gather you from thence, and bring you back to the place which I have chosen for my name to dwell there.'
      v:010: 'NEH:1:10 | 10 | 10 | And these are thy servants, and thy people: whom thou hast redeemed by thy great strength, and by thy mighty hand.'
      v:011: "NEH:1:11 | 11 | 11 | I beseech thee, O Lord, let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and direct thy servant this day, and give him mercy before this man. For I was the king's cup-bearer."

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'NEH:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Year.</i> It seems the Persians began the year with Tizri, since both Casleu (the third) and Nisan (the seventh month of the civil year) fall on the twentieth of the king. --- <i>Wine.</i> These kings drunk only that of Syria. (Strabo xv.) --- People of distinction were appointed cup-bearers; and even the children of kings did not esteem the office beneath them. (Herodotus iii. 34.) (Athen. x. 6.) (Homer, &c.) (Calmet) --- <i>I was.</i> Protestants, "I had not been <i>before-time</i> sad in his presence." (Haydock) --- Hebrew literally, "I was not evil." Septuagint, "an enemy, <i>or</i> stranger." Arabic, "disagreeable." Syriac, "sorrowful." Septuagint also, "there was not another ({GREEK:START ouk en eteros}ουκ ην ητηροσ{GREEK:END}) present," chap. v. 6. St. Jerome seems not to have read the negation. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - 'NEH:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Is not.</i> Hebrew, "nothing but sorrow of heart;" (Syriac; Calmet; Protestants) or rather, thou art meditating only treason. Septuagint, "This is nothing but wickedness of heart," (Haydock) which often shews itself on the countenance. The king might suspect that he was giving him poison. (Menochius) --- Hence Nehemias feared, (Calmet) dreading such suspicions, (Haydock) and aware lest the company might frustrate his good design, as contrary to the interests of the crown. (Tirinus)'
      v:003:
        - 'NEH:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Live;</i> an usual salutation, Daniel iii. 9., and v. 10. So Ælian (var. i. 32.) says, "O king Artaxerxes, mayst thou reign for ever." --- <i>Father,</i> ver. 5. He knew that the Persians shewed great regard to the dead, (Calmet; Tirinus) whose bodies they sometimes cover with wax, and keep in their house, (Cic.[Cicero?] Tusc. i.; Alex. Genial iii. 2.) or inter. (Herodotus i. 140.)'
      v:004:
        - "NEH:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Heaven,</i> a fervent ejaculation, in secret, (Tirinus) to touch the king's heart, (Calmet) and to enable me to speak in a proper manner. (Menochius)"
      v:006:
        - 'NEH:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>And,</i> &c. In private the queen might dine with her husband, but not in public, Esther i. (Calmet) --- <i>Queen;</i> probably Esther, if she were married to this king. (Menochius) --- But this is uncertain. (Haydock) --- Usher thinks it was Damaspia, mentioned by Ctesias. (Calmet) --- <i>Time,</i> when I should return. Some say a year (Tirinus) or two afterwards; but it is generally believed that he begged to be absent twelve years.  He then waited on the king eight or ten years, and returned into Judea towards the end of the reign of Artaxerxes, chap. xiii. 6. (Calmet) --- He perhaps asked permission to visit Jerusalem for only a short period, at first, but his presence being deemed necessary, he was permitted to continue there as governor full twelve years. (Menochius)'
      v:007:
        - 'NEH:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Over;</i> give me a guard, (Haydock) or accompany me to Jerusalem. (Menochius)'
      v:008:
        - 'NEH:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Forest.</i> Hebrew <i>pordes,</i> "paradise," or garden planted with trees. Pliny ([Natural History?] v. 23.) mentions a "paradise," in Cœlosyria. (Grotius) --- But Nehemias might petition to be supplied with cedars from Libanus, (Tirinus) as they had been given for the temple, 1 Esdras iii. 7. (Haydock) --- <i>Tower.</i> Hebrew <i>bira,</i> means also "a palace or temple." It may designate the porch of the temple, which was 120 cubits high; (2 Paralipomenon iii. 4.; Calmet) though that had been lately repaired by Esdras. (Menochius) --- Others think the doors of the courts are meant, as they were as strong as those of towers. (Vatable) --- They were not yet finished, chap. x. 9. Many believe that (Calmet) Nehemias speaks of the royal palace, which had been almost contiguous to the temple, (Menochius) where he intended to build one for himself, while he should reside in the city. (Tirinus) --- But this might give umbrage to the king. (Calmet) --- He could not, however, intend his favourite to remain without a suitable palace; and the latter seems to have designed not only to repair that which Solomon had founded, but also to erect another <i>house</i> for the governor. (Haydock) --- <i>Good hand;</i> favour, (Menochius) and powerful aid. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - 'NEH:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Horonite,</i> a native, not (Calmet) a petty king (Grotius) of Horonaim, in the country of Moab, Jeremias xlviii. 3. He must have been very old, if he lived till the temple was built at Garizim: (Josephus and Scaliger) but Petau supposes that there were two of the name. --- <i>Servant;</i> an officer appointed over the Samaritans, as well as Sanaballat. The Persian monarchs styled all their subjects servants or slaves. (Calmet) --- <i>Grieved.</i> Thus unbelievers repine when any one endeavours to propagate the truth, (Haydock) or to establish the Church. (Worthington)'
      v:012:
        - 'NEH:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Any man,</i> at Jerusalem, (ver. 16.) though he had informed the king, ver. 8. (Haydock) --- <i>No beast;</i> that none might be alarmed.'
      v:013:
        - 'NEH:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Valley</i> of Cedron, on the east, (Calmet) or west, near Calvary. (Menochius) (Tirinus) --- <i>Dragon.</i> Hebrew <i>Tannin,</i> or "great fish," which might be kept there, unless the fountain was famous for the appearance of some dragon, or the water proceeded from the mouth of a brazen one. Septuagint have read <i>thanim,</i> "figs." The fountain of Siloe might have many names. (Calmet) --- <i>Viewed.</i> Septuagint, "I walked upon the wall of Jerusalem, which these men are demolishing <i>or</i> clearing away," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - 'NEH:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Aqueduct,</i> or reservoir, made by Ezechias, 2 Paralipomenon xxxii. 30.'
      v:015:
        - 'NEH:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Torrent</i> of Cedron, having gone round the city. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'NEH:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Magistrates.</i> Septuagint, "guards." <i>Seganim</i> denotes various officers. (Calmet) --- <i>Work,</i> or to any workmen. (Haydock) --- None were now employed. (Tirinus)'
      v:018:
        - 'NEH:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Hand.</i> God had manifested his goodness and power, at the court of Persia. (Worthington)'
      v:019:
        - 'NEH:2:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Arabian</i> governor. He afterwards accuses Nehemias, chap. vi. 6. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - 'NEH:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Answered.</i> Septuagint, "returned them an account ({GREEK:START logon}λογον{GREEK:END}) ....we are his pure servants, and we will build." (Haydock) --- <i>Part,</i> or business, 1 Esdras iv. 4. --- <i>Justice,</i> or right to the city. (Calmet) --- You may mind your own affairs. (Tirinus) --- <i>Remembrance.</i> It was esteemed a high honour to be a citizen of Jerusalem, Psalm lxxxvi. 5.'

      v:002: 'NEH:2:2 | 2 | 2 | And the king said to me: Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou dost not appear to be sick? this is not without cause, but some evil, I know not what, is in thy heart. And I was seized with an exceedingly great fear:'
      v:003: 'NEH:2:3 | 3 | 3 | And I said to the king: O king, live for ever: why should not my countenance be sorrowful, seeing the city of the place of the sepulchres of my fathers is desolate, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire?'
      v:004: 'NEH:2:4 | 4 | 4 | Then the king said to me: For what doest thou make request? And I prayed to the God of heaven.'
      v:005: 'NEH:2:5 | 5 | 5 | And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, and if thy servant hath found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me into Judea, to the city of the sepulchre of my father, and I will build it.'
      v:006: 'NEH:2:6 | 6 | 6 | And the king said to me, and the queen that sat by him: For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And it pleased the king, and he sent me: and I fixed him a time.'
      v:007: 'NEH:2:7 | 7 | 7 | And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, let him give me letters to the governors of the country beyond the river, that they convey me over, till I come into Judea:'

      v:011: 'NEH:2:11 | 11 | 11 | And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.'
      v:012: 'NEH:2:12 | 12 | 12 | And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me, and I told not any man what God had put in my heart to do in Jerusalem, and there was no beast with me, but the beast that I rode upon.'
      v:013: 'NEH:2:13 | 13 | 13 | And I went out by night, by the gate of the valley, and before the dragon-fountain, and to the dung gate, and I viewed the wall of Jerusalem, which was broken down, and the gates thereof, which were consumed with fire.'
      v:014: "NEH:2:14 | 14 | 14 | And I passed to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's aqueduct, and there was no place for the beast on which I rode to pass."

      v:016: 'NEH:2:16 | 16 | 16 | But the magistrates knew not whither I went, or what I did: neither had I as yet told any thing to the Jews, or to the priests, or to the nobles, or to the magistrates, or to the rest that did the work.'
      v:017: 'NEH:2:17 | 17 | 17 | Then I said to them: You know the affliction wherein we are, because Jerusalem is desolate, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire: come, and let us build up the walls of Jerusalem, and let us be no longer a reproach.'
      v:018: "NEH:2:18 | 18 | 18 | And I shewed them how the hand of my God was good with me, and the king's words, which he had spoken to me, and I said: Let us rise up, and build. And their hands were strengthened in good."
      v:019: 'NEH:2:19 | 19 | 19 | But Sanaballat, the Horonite, and Tobias, the servant, the Ammonite, and Gossem, the Arabian, heard of it, and they scoffed at us, and despised us, and said: What is this thing that you do? are you going to rebel against the king?'
      v:020: 'NEH:2:20 | 20 | 20 | And I answered them, and said to them: The God of heaven he helpeth us, and we are his servants: let us rise up and build: but you have no part, nor justice, nor remembrance in Jerusalem.'

But the situation of these gates is not ascertained. --- <i>Sanctified it,</i> beginning the work (Calmet) with some religious ceremonies. (Junius) --- It was designed to protect God's temple; and therefore, when finished, they dedicated it (Worthington) with solemnity, as they did all the walls, chap. xii. 27. The like custom is observed on laying the foundation-stone of our temples. (Haydock) <i>Sanctified</i> may also mean, cleared away the rubbish.

(Calmet) (Delrio, adag. 221.) --- Septuagint, \"heal.\" God's providence did not permit the enemy to rage, till the work was greatly advanced; so infidels laugh at the attempts of poor priests to restore religion, which nevertheless flourishes.

But the servants of God express their approbation (Calmet) of his inscrutable counsels. The imperative in Hebrew is often used for the future tense. (Haydock) --- <i>Mocked.</i> Protestants, "provoked <i>thee....</i>before the builders." Septuagint omit most of this and the following verses; having only, "Do not hide <i>thyself,</i> with respect to wickedness." (Haydock)'

It is a pity that we have no foundation for this in Scripture. (Calmet) See 1 Esdras iv. 3.

"They come up from all places against us." (Haydock) --- De Dieu would translate, "return to us," cultivate the friendship of Sanaballat; or "return home," and leave off this work.

See Dr. Milner's 4th let. to a Preb.; Debates in Parl. 1810, &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Villages.</i> Most of the Latin editions, before Sixtus V read, <i>in vitulis in campo uno,</i> (Calmet) \"with <i>sacrifices of</i> calves in <i>some</i> one field.\" (Haydock) --- Perhaps Cephirim, (Tirinus) or <i>copirim,</i> \"villages,\" (Haydock) may be the name of a place in the plain of <i>Ono,</i> (Tirinus) which is styled the <i>valley of craftsmen,</i> (chap. xi. 35.; Calmet) in the tribe of Benjamin, near the Jordan.

The letter might be an order to appear, or might be left open to signify that the bearer was a man of confidence, from whom Nehemias might receive any farther information; unless it was sent in this manner out of contempt. --- <i>Gossem,</i> the Arabian governor, chap. ii. 19.

      v:007:
        - 'NEH:6:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Prophets.</i> This was false; though, no doubt, the true prophets who lived at that time, would promote the laudable undertakings of Nehemias.

The first sense appears to be preferable. Nehemias did not take the information as a piece of civility.

Those who suppose that Nehemias was a priest, say (Calmet) that he refused to flee, lest he should intimidate the people by his cowardly departure.

(Vatable) --- But the work only lasted the time here specified, as the materials were at hand, and some of the walls were standing, while the rocks defended other parts; and the city was not then so large as it was afterwards.

(Tirinus) --- Thus Alexander the Great built the walls of New Alexandria, on the Tanais, 60 stadia, or near 6000 paces (Calmet) long, in less than twenty days; (Tirinus) and Cæsar perfected other works, before Alise, &c., with equal expedition.

(Menochius) --- But as it was not yet built, <i>the house,</i> being placed alone, more properly signifies the temple.

(Calmet) --- Some think that various catalogues were taken, at Babylon, at the first coming to Jerusalem, (Menochius) and at the dedication of the temple; (Tirinus) and that Nehemias refer to a different one from that of Esdras. (Sa) (Lucas) (Tirinus) --- Others suppose that changes were introduced, as the families were increased or diminished, in the time of Nehemias; (Tirinus) who, therefore, judged it necessary to write a fresh catalogue, but only adjusted the old one to the present circumstances, including probably the names of those who had returned with Esdras, or with himself. (Calmet) --- This seems contrary to the text, <i>a book of,</i> &c., and it would perhaps be as well to allow that the variations arise from transcribers, as all allow that many of the names and numbers are corrupted.

Pure Hebrew was still retained in the public liturgy. (Tirinus) --- Thus the Catholic Church retains the use of the language first use in the conversion of the respective people, whether Greek, Latin, &c., while she takes care to explain to the people what is necessary, in their own language. Any change might be attended with more serious inconveniences than benefit. Our Saviour never blamed this practice, which subsisted among the Jews in his time, no more than that which obliged the people to keep <i>without,</i> while the priest offered incense, &c., Luke i. 10, 21. --- <i>And plainly.</i> Protestants, "and gave the sense, and caused <i>them</i> to understand the reading," as much as they were able, though many would, no doubt, still find difficulties, as we do at present.

(Haydock) --- On days of mourning, the Jews assembled four times to pray, and thrice on other days, by the institution of Esdras. (Maimonides) See Acts iii. 1. --- On their fasts, they refrained from all meat, as well as from work, spending their time in prayer. They began at the first hour, and continued their exercises of devotion till the third, when they recommenced for other three hours. They did the like at the sixth and ninth hours; hearing the law, then prostrating themselves to confess their sins. Afterwards they rose to join with the Levites in praising the Lord. (Calmet)'

The ancient Rabbins understood this literally, affirming that Abraham was cast into the fire by the idolaters, and brought out by a miracle without any hurt. (Challoner) --- The Chaldeans adored fire, (St. Jerome, q. Heb. in Genesis xi. 31.) and the Persians probably imitated them. (Strabo xv.) --- The emperor Heraclius destroyed their <i>Pyreia.</i> (Suidas.) --- St. Jerome translates <i>Ur of the Chaldeans,</i> in all other places. (Amama) --- Septuagint, "the country of," &c.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'NEH:13:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>That day,</i> is often used for an indefinite time. (Haydock) --- It is not probable that all this happened when the walls were dedicated. After that event, Nehemias rather went to court, and remained there about ten years. During his absence, many abuses crept in, which he endeavoured to remedy, (ver. 7.) perhaps on the solemn <i>day</i> of tabernacles, when the law had been read. --- <i>Ever,</i> (Deuteronomy xxiii. 3.) so as to marry. (Calmet)'

It is probable that he was a different person from the high priest, (Usher) who had married his grandson to the daughter of Sanaballat, the intimate friend of Tobias. (Calmet) --- The latter was a persecutor, and prefigured heretics, as Nehemias did our Saviour, who drove traffickers out of the temple. (Ven. Bede in Esdras, L. iii. 19.) (Worthington)'
      v:005:
        - "NEH:13:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>He.</i> Eliasib, or Tobias. The original is also ambiguous. Eliasib probably permitted Tobias to furnish himself apartments in the temple, where, by law, he was not allowed to enter. Hence the priests, being deprived of their support, were forced to retire. (Calmet) --- Tobias rented the apartments, and was steward of the priests' revenues. (Tirinus)"

        - 'NEH:13:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Days.</i> Prefixed (chap. ii. 6.) <i>I asked.</i> Hebrew, "was required <i>to attend</i> by the king," for about ten years.

      v:021:
        - 'NEH:13:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>On you.</i> To punish you, (Calmet) for thus endeavouring to tempt the people. (Haydock)'

        - 'NEH:13:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Half.</i> In the same family, some spoke the Philistine (Vatable) or Phenician language: others the Hebrew; which, though it resembled the other very much, was still sufficiently distinct to be noticed. The children might also speak a jargon, composed of both languages. It is probable that, at this time, many of the common people spoke the Chaldean language, so that it was necessary to interpret pure Hebrew to them, chap. viii. 8.'
      v:025:
        - 'NEH:13:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Curse,</i> or excommunicated <i>them,</i> (Calmet) the guilty parents. (Haydock) --- <i>Shaved.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "plucked off their hair," by the roots, for greater torment. Sometimes quicklime was then sprinkled on the head, (Calmet) as adulterers were treated at Athens. Schol. Aristoph.[Aristophanes?] --- King Artaxerxes changed this punishment, and ordered that his officers should be forbidden to wear the tiara instead. Domitian caused the hair and beard of Apollonius to be shaven. (Philost. iii. 14.) (Calmet) --- <i>That they.</i> Hebrew, "Ye shall not," &c.'

        - 'NEH:13:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Also be.</i> Hebrew, "hearken unto you;" (Protestants; Haydock) or "Have ye not heard the <i>evils which fell upon our fathers</i> (Calmet) for doing all?" &c. (Haydock)'

        - 'NEH:13:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>One.</i> Manasses, brother of Jaddus. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xi. 8.) --- <i>Sanaballet,</i> noted for his enmity towards the Jews, chap. vi. 1. He obtained leave of Alexander to build the famous temple on Garizim, for his son-in-law. He must have been 150 yeas old when Alexander laid siege to Tyre, the year of the world 3672. Esdras and Nehemias were noted for their great age. Yet some would suppose that there were two of the name of Sanaballet; and Josephus says that the one in question was appointed governor of Samaria by Darius, the last king of the Persians. This opinion is adopted by Usher, the year of the world 3972. (Tirinus, &c.) --- But there is still a difficulty to know whether it be necessary. (Calmet) --- <i>From me.</i> In revenge he set up an opposition altar. (Haydock) --- He had contracted a marriage, which was unlawful for all, and entailed degradation upon priests.'

(Worthington) --- <i>Amen,</i> is not found in Hebrew, &c. The Holy Spirit records the praises of Nehemias, Ecclesiasticus xlix. 15. His political and moral virtues must ever assign him an exalted rank among the true Israelites. Like Jesus Christ, he rebuilt Jerusalem, reformed the nation, was the mediator of a new covenant, defended the rights of the priesthood and of all the people. (Calmet)'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - 'This Book takes its name from the writer, who was cup-bearer to Artaxerxes, (surnamed <i>Longimanus</i>) king of Persia, and was sent by him with a commission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. It is also called the Second Book of <i>Esdras,</i> because it is a continuation of the history begun by Esdras, of the state of the people of God after their return from captivity. (Challoner) --- Genebrard believes that the latter wrote the work. But how long must he thus have lived? and how come the lists to vary so much? (Calmet) --- We may allow that these variations are owing to the mistakes of transcribers, (1 Esdras ii. 1.) for the writer of both works was certainly inspired. Esdras lived a long time along with Nehemias; (chap. xii. 35.) and he may have left memorials, as well as the latter, from which the present work seems to be compiled. (Haydock) --- Some additions have been made since the days of Nehemias, particularly chap. xii. to ver. 26, or at least (Calmet) the five last of these verses. (Capel.) (Chronicles) --- The passage cited from the commentaries of Nehemias, (2 Machabees ii. 13.) is not to be found here; which shews that we have not his entire work, but only an abridgment, in which the author has adopted his words, with some few alterations. The fifth chapter seems to be out of its place, and also the dedication of the walls, chap. xii. 27. Nehemias was a person in great favour at the court of Persia; and of high birth, probably of the royal family, (Eusebius; Isidore; Genebrard in Chron.) as most of the ancients believe that all who governed, till the time of the Asmoneans, were of the tribe of Juda. Hence he styles Hanani his brother, (chap. i. 2.) and declines entering into the temple, chap. vi. 11. His name never occurs among the priests; and though we read [in] 2 Machabees i. 18, 21, <i>jussit sacerdos Nehemias,</i> (Tirinus) the Greek has, "Nehemias ordered the priests;" {GREEK:START iereis}ιηρηισ{GREEK:END}: (Calmet; Huet; Du Hamel) and the title of <i>priest</i> sometimes is given to laymen at the head of affairs. (Haydock) --- In this character Nehemias appeared, by order of Artaxerxes: and notwithstanding the obstructions of the enemies of Juda, rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem, and returned after twelve years to court, making a second visit to his own country, a little before the death of the king, whom he probably survived only one year, dying the year of the world 3580, about thirty years after he had been appointed governor. (Calmet) --- In the two first chapters, we behold his solicitude for the welfare of his country, in the ten following his success, and in the last what abuses he corrected. (Worthington) --- He renewed the covenant with God, (chap. ix., and x.) sent for the sacred fire, and established a library at Jerusalem, 2 Machabees i. 19, 34., and ii. 13. (Haydock) '
