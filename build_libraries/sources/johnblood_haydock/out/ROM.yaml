    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'ROM:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Called</i> to be <i>an apostle,</i>[1] or <i>a called apostle.</i> That is, not only having the name of an apostle, but having his call to this high function, and his mission from God. --- <i>Separated unto the gospel of God.</i> He means that he was separated from others, and appointed by the Holy Ghost to preach the gospel, as we read Acts xiii. 2. when the Holy Ghost to those of the Church at Antioch, said, <i>Separate me Saul and Barnabas, for the work unto which I have taken them.</i> (Witham)'
      v:002:
        - 'ROM:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Which he had promised before,</i> &c. That is, God before, in the Scriptures, promised the blessings, which are now come by the preaching of the gospel, and that they should come by <i>his Son.</i> (Witham)'
      v:003:
        - 'ROM:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Who was made to him of the seed of David, according to the flesh.</i> The sense is, that God promised, that he who was his true and only Son from eternity, should also become his son, as man; that the same son should be man, as well as God, when the <i>word was made flesh,</i> or when that divine person should be united to our human nature. Thus the same person, who was his only begotten Son from eternity, being made man, and of the <i>seed of David,</i> by his incarnation, was still his Son, both as God, and also as man. (Witham) --- The Greek text has not the particle <i>ei,</i> (to him) but only {GREEK:START tou genomenou ek spermatos David}του γηνωηνου ηκ σπηρματοσ Δαvιδ{GREEK:END}. But St. Irenæus, (lib. iii. chap. 18.) St. Ambrose, St. Jerome read, Qui factus est ei. And also St. Augustine in his unfinished exposition of the epistle to the Romans; though before in his book against Faustus, (lib. xi. chap. 14.) he reads it otherwise. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - "ROM:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Who was predestined</i>[2] <i>the Son of God.</i> The learned bishop of Meaux, Bossuet, in his second Pastoral Instruction, in which he condemned the French translation of Mons. Simon, (p. 127.) takes notice, that according to St. Paul, and the constant doctrine of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas, Christ as man, or the human nature of Christ united to his divine person, was predestinated without any precedent merits, by a free and liberal predestination of God's goodness. (Witham) --- Christ, as man, was predestinated to be the Son of God; and declared to be so (as the apostle here signifies) <i>first</i> by <i>power,</i> that is, by his working stupendous miracles; <i>secondly,</i> by the <i>spirit of sanctification,</i> that is, by his infinite sanctity; <i>thirdly,</i> by his <i>resurrection,</i> or raising himself from the dead. (Challoner)"
      v:005:
        - 'ROM:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>By whom,</i> i.e. by this same Jesus Christ, God and man, <i>we,</i> I and the rest of the apostles, <i>have received</i> this <i>grace and apostleship,</i> this mission and commission from him, of preaching his gospel, and teaching his doctrine. --- <i>For obedience to the faith in all nations;</i> that is, to bring all nations to the obedience and profession of his new law and doctrine. (Witham)'
      v:006:
        - 'ROM:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Among whom are you also the called of Jesus.</i> That is, you also are a part of those, who by his mercy, are called to this faith and belief in him. All beginning from those words in the third verse, <i>who was made to him,</i> &c. till the end of the sixth verse, are to be taken as within a parenthesis, which is not unusual in the style of St. Paul. Then he goes on after this long parenthesis. (Witham)'
      v:007:
        - 'ROM:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>To all that are at Rome...called</i> to be <i>saints.</i> That is, who not only are named saints, but who by such a call from God, are to be sanctified by his grace, and to become holy, or saints. (Witham)'
      v:008:
        - 'ROM:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>In the whole world.</i> That is, to all, or almost all the Roman empire. (Witham)'
      v:009:
        - ROM:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>God is my witness.</i> I call God to witness. It is an oath. (Witham)
      v:014:
        - 'ROM:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>I am a debtor.</i> That is, I am bound to preach the word of God to all. (Witham) --- By Greeks, in this place, are understood the Romans also, and by Barbarians, all other people who were neither Greeks nor Romans. The Greeks called all barbarians, who did not speak the Greek language, even the Latins themselves. But after the Romans became masters of the world, they were excepted, through policy, from the number of barbarians, and particularly after they began to cultivate the science of the Greeks.{JOIN}{BQ:2}Græcia victa ferum victorem cepit, et artes{JOIN}{BQ:2}Intulit agresti Latio.{JOIN}--- St. Paul says, that he is a debtor both to Greeks and barbarians, to the wise, the philosophers, those who pass for sages amongst the pagans, and to the simple, ignorant, unlettered class of mankind: not that he had received any thing at their hands, but because it was his duty, in quality of apostle, to address himself to the whole world, and preach to the great and to the small, to the learned and the unlearned. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - 'ROM:1:15 | 15 | 15 | St. Paul was even anxious to go and deliver the word to the Romans. Hence Mat. Polus, in his reflections on this verse, puts the following words into the mouth of the Apostle: Lucifuga non sum: ostendi id Antiochiæ, Athenis, Ephesi et Corinthi: paratus sum & in illa splendidissima urbe Roma ostendere.'
      v:016:
        - 'ROM:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one;</i> that is, it brings powerful helps to all, both Gentiles and Jews, in order to their salvation. --- <i>To the Jew first,</i> inasmuch as the gospel is to be first preached to the Jews. (Witham) --- The promises of salvation were first made to the Jews. Jesus Christ preached to the Jews only, and forbad his disciples, during his life-time, to preach to any other nation. And after his resurrection, when they had full powers to preach every where, they did not turn to the Gentiles, till the Jews had refused to hear them. A miracle was necessary to determine St. Peter to communicate the gospel to the uncircumcised; and St. Paul, in every place, first addressed himself to the Jew, and then to the Gentile. The apostle here sweetly endeavours, in an indirect manner, to silence the presumption of the Romans, who seemed to raise themselves above the Jews, and believed they had merited the grace of vocation to the faith. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'ROM:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>For the justice of God.</i> He does not here mean that justice, by which God is just in himself, but that justice, or sanctification, which he communicates to men, and by which they are justified and sanctified. --- <i>From faith to faith.</i> That is, by faith, and an increase in faith, inasmuch as, by increasing in faith, we advance in virtues; as it is written, (Habacuc ii. 4.) <i>the just man liveth by faith;</i> including the love of God, hope, and other virtues. (Witham)'
      v:018:
        - 'ROM:1:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>For the wrath of God is revealed,</i> &c. He begins to speak of the heathens, and of the wicked world, whose sins God punisheth from time to time with visible chastisements of plagues, famines, wars, &c. and that because they <i>detain the truth of God in injustice, or in iniquity,</i> that is, because they have not honoured God, even according to the knowledge which he has given them of him, especially their philosophers. (Witham)'
      v:019:
        - 'ROM:1:19 | 19 | 19-20 | <i>That which is known of God.</i> Or may be easily known of God, <i>is manifest in them.</i> The light of reason demonstrates to them the existence of one God, the maker and preserver of all things. This is made known to them from <i>the creation of the world,</i> or from the <i>creatures</i> in the world: the Creator may be discovered by the creatures, and as St. Chrysostom here says, every Scythian, every barbarian, may come to the knowledge of God by the wonderful <i>harmony</i>[3] <i>of all things, which proclaims the existence of God louder than any trumpet:</i> but having known him, they did not glorify him; they acted contrary to their knowledge, abandoning themselves to idolatry, and the vain worship of many gods, and to all manner of vices and abominations against the light of reason. (Witham)'
      v:024:
        - 'ROM:1:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Wherefore God gave them</i>[4] <i>up,</i> &c. That is, as St. Chrysostom says, permitted them, in punishment of their wilful blindness, to fall into the foulest, most shameful, and unnatural sins of uncleanness here described. (Witham)'
      v:026:
        - 'ROM:1:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>God delivered them up.</i> Not by being author of their sins, but by withdrawing his grace, and so permitting them, in punishment of their pride, to fall into those shameful sins. (Challoner)'
      v:027:
        - 'ROM:1:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Receiving in themselves the recompense...due to their error.</i> That is, were justly punished for their wilful blindness and error, by which they had worshipped and adored creatures, instead of the Creator, idols instead of the one true God. (Witham)'
      v:029:
        - ROM:1:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Being filled with all iniquity.</i> He passeth to many other sins and crimes of the heathens. (Witham)
      v:030:
        - 'ROM:1:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Hateful</i>[5] <i>to God.</i> The Greek may also signify, <i>haters of God.</i> (Witham) --- {GREEK:START theostugeis}θηοστυγηισ{GREEK:END} means either haters of God, or hated by God. (Menochius) --- <i>Disobedient to parents.</i> The Greek literally signifies, Not listening to the advice of their parents; who rise up against them, and refuse to obey. (Calmet)'
      v:031:
        - 'ROM:1:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Dissolute, rude</i>[6] in their manners, and behaviour. Some, from the Greek, understand breakers of their word; but this would be the same as <i>without fidelity,</i> which we find afterwards in the same verse. (Witham)'
      v:032:
        - 'ROM:1:32 | 32 | 32 | This passage in the present Greek versions is rather different from the Vulgate: but the text of the Vulgate is conformable to the most ancient Greek manuscripts, of which some are more than twelve hundred years old. {GREEK:START Oitines to dikaioma tou theou epignontes ouk enoesan oti oi ta toiauta prassontes axioi thanatou eisin, ou monon de oi poiountes auta, alla kai oi suneudokountes tois prassousin}Οιτινησ το δικαιωα του θηου ηπιγνοντησ ουκ ηνοησαν οτι οι τα τοιαυτα πρασσοντησ αξιοι θανατου ηισιν, ου μονον δη οι ποιουντησ αυτα, αλλα και οι συνηυδοκουντησ τοισ πρασσουσιν{GREEK:END}. See Var. Lect. Mill. in hunc locum et Prolegom. 41. 42.'

      v:010: 'ROM:1:10 | 10 | 10 | Always in my prayers: beseeching, if by any means I may at length have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, in coming to you.'
      v:011: 'ROM:1:11 | 11 | 11 | For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace, to strengthen you:'
      v:012: 'ROM:1:12 | 12 | 12 | That is to say, that I may be comforted together in you, by that which is common to us both, your faith and mine.'
      v:013: 'ROM:1:13 | 13 | 13 | And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come to you, (and have been hindered hitherto) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.'
      v:014: 'ROM:1:14 | 14 | 14 | To the Greeks, and to the Barbarians, to the wise, and to the unwise, I am a debtor:'
      v:015: ROM:1:15 | 15 | 15 | So (as much as is in me) I am ready to preach the gospel to you also that are at Rome.
      v:016: 'ROM:1:16 | 16 | 16 | For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation, to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and to the Greek.'
      v:017: 'ROM:1:17 | 17 | 17 | For the justice of God is revealed therein from faith to faith: as it is written: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}The just man liveth by faith.'
      v:018: 'ROM:1:18 | 18 | 18 | For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, against all impiety and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God in injustice.'

      v:020: 'ROM:1:20 | 20 | 20 | For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made: his eternal power also and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.'
      v:021: 'ROM:1:21 | 21 | 21 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Because that, when they knew God, they did not glorify him as God, or give thanks: but became vain in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was darkened:'
      v:022: 'ROM:1:22 | 22 | 22 | For professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.'
      v:023: 'ROM:1:23 | 23 | 23 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into the likeness of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and of four-footed beasts, and of creeping things.'
      v:024: 'ROM:1:24 | 24 | 24 | Wherefore God gave them up to the desires of their heart, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}to uncleanness: to dishonour their own bodies among themselves.'
      v:025: 'ROM:1:25 | 25 | 25 | Who changed the truth of God into a lie: and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.'
      v:026: ROM:1:26 | 26 | 26 | For this cause God delivered them up to shameful affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that use which is against nature.
      v:027: 'ROM:1:27 | 27 | 27 | And, in like manner the men also, leaving the natural use of the woman, have burned in their lusts one towards another, men with men working that which is filthy, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was due to their error.'
      v:028: 'ROM:1:28 | 28 | 28 | And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge; God delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not convenient,'
      v:029: 'ROM:1:29 | 29 | 29 | Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness, full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, malignity, whisperers,'
      v:030: 'ROM:1:30 | 30 | 30 | Detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,'
      v:031: 'ROM:1:31 | 31 | 31 | Foolish, dissolute, without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.'
      v:032: 'ROM:1:32 | 32 | 32 | Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand that they, who do such things, are worthy of death: and not only they who do them, but they also who consent to them that do them.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'ROM:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Wherefore thou art inexcusable,</i> &c. He seems to give a general admonition to every one, both Jews and Gentiles, not to blame, judge, or condemn others, when perhaps he, or those of his religion, may be guilty of the like sins. Let him rather call to mind the just judgment of God, which, they that are sinners, cannot escape. Let him also reflect, that if God hath hitherto deferred to punish him, it hath been through <i>the riches</i> and abundance <i>of his goodness, patience,</i> and <i>long-forbearance, or longanimity:</i> that he must take care not to <i>harden</i> his heart any longer, lest he <i>heap</i> up to himself a fatal treasure at the day of judgment, when God will render to every one <i>according to his works,</i> and not according to his faith only, says St. Chrysostom, hom. v. (Witham)'
      v:005:
        - 'ROM:2:5 | 5 | 5 | The apostle is evidently speaking to the converted Jews, and not to the Gentiles. For the Gentiles believed in certain judges in hell, who passed sentence on every one as soon as he departed out of life. This is what the learned call poetical theology, and considered as fabulous. But besides a particular judgment at the hour of death, the Hebrews believed in a general judgment of all men, or at least of all the just, in the valley of Jehosaphat; as may be seen in the prophets, and the books of Wisdom and Machabees. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - 'ROM:2:9 | 9 | 9-10 | <i>Of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.</i> That is, God, as a just judge, will not have any <i>respect to their persons,</i> but punish or reward both Jews and Gentiles, according to their good or bad works. And salvation is now offered to both. (Witham)'
      v:012:
        - 'ROM:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Whosoever have sinned without the law.</i> That is, without the written law of Moses, against their reason and conscience, &c. And also those who being Jews, have sinned <i>under this</i> written law, shall <i>be judged,</i> even with greater severity, for having transgressed against the known law. (Witham)'
      v:014:
        - 'ROM:2:14 | 14 | 14-15 | <i>When the Gentiles...do by nature,</i> or naturally, that is, without having received any written law, <i>these men are a law to themselves,</i> and have it <i>written in their hearts,</i> as to the existence of a God, and their reason tells them, that many sins are unlawful: they may also do some actions that are morally good, as by giving alms to relieve the poor, honouring their parents, &c. not that these actions, morally good, will suffice for their justification of themselves, or make them deserve a supernatural reward in the kingdom of heaven; but God, out of his infinite mercy, will give them some supernatural graces, by which they come to know, and believe, that he will reward their souls for eternity. Such, says St. Chrysostom, were the dispositions of Melchisedech, Job, Cornelius the Centurion, &c. (Witham)'
      v:017:
        - 'ROM:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>But if thou art called a Jew.</i> In the common Greek copies, we read, <i>behold, thou art a Jew,</i> &c. St. Paul here turns his discourse particularly to the Jews, who valued themselves so much upon their law, their temple, and their ceremonies; and therefore are said to <i>rest on the law,</i> as if it were enough to be by profession a Jew. (Witham) --- But many manuscripts, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, St. Ambrose, Sedul., Theophylactus, &c. read it as in the Vulgate, {GREEK:START ei su Ioudaios}ηι συ Ιουδαιοσ{GREEK:END}. (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - 'ROM:2:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Thou, therefore, that teachest another, teachest not thyself,</i> &c. St. Chrysostom (hom. vi.) takes these sentences as so many interrogations; dost thou teach thyself? dost thou not steal? dost thou not commit adultery? &c. (Witham)'
      v:022:
        - 'ROM:2:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Idols,</i> &c. The Jews, at the time of our Saviour, were free from idolatry, to which their ancestors had been so prone for so long a time. But to this evil had succeeded another, scarcely less heinous, viz. sacrilege, and a profanation of holy things. The greater part of the high priests bought their office. The priests permitted in the temple itself a kind of traffic, which caused our Saviour to declare to them, that they had made the house of his Father a den of thieves. And to favour their own avarice, they taught that it was lawful to defraud their creditors, and refuse to their parents the necessary succour, in the case of vows to give to the temple. St. Paul does not here reproach them for the profanations of the temple which they committed in the last siege of Jerusalem, for it had not then taken place; but he knew full will the dispositions of their hearts, and the little regard they had for the most sacred things. (Calmet)'
      v:024:
        - 'ROM:2:24 | 24 | 24 | The apostle here only repeats the reproaches which the prophets had repeated so often before, that the Jews, by the contrast between their lives and the sanctity of their religion, had been the cause of that religion and worship being the ridicule and laughing-stock of the Gentile world. (Calmet) --- A reproach this, which also bears very heavy upon many Christians of the present day; who by their profession believe the truth of the one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic faith, and by their conduct belie the same, leading lives unworthy of pagans. (Haydock)'
      v:025:
        - 'ROM:2:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Circumcision profiteth indeed,</i> inasmuch as it was ordained by Almighty God, as were also the precepts of the law, which were to be observed before the publishing of the new law of Christ. See Galatians v. 6. But it was never profitable to the <i>transgressors of the law.</i> Nay, the uncircumcised Gentiles, who have complied with those natural precepts, which are also commanded by the law of Moses, shall judge and condemn those, who received the written law, and at the same time were transgressors of it. (Witham)'
      v:026:

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "ROM:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>What advantage then?</i> &c. The apostle, not to offend the Jews, by insisting too long in reprehending them, turns his discourse to the advantages they have hitherto had above other nations. As <i>first,</i> that the <i>words of God,</i> those divine oracles, revelations, promises in the Scriptures, were credited or intrusted to them. And though <i>some,</i> or many of them have <i>not believed</i> God's promises, especially concerning their Messias; this hath not hindered <i>God from</i> being <i>faithful</i> to his word, in sending the Messias, and those blessings that were promised with him. <i>For God</i> is always <i>true,</i> or <i>faithful</i> in his promises, and therefore must needs <i>be justified,</i> or found just, when his proceedings are judged, that is, considered and examined. (Witham)"
      v:004:
        - 'ROM:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>God</i> only <i>is</i> essentially <i>true.</i> All men in their own capacity are liable to lies and errors: nevertheless God, who is the <i>truth,</i> will make good his promise of keeping his Church in all <i>truth.</i> See St. John, xvi. 13. (Challoner) --- The Greek text has, "may God be true;" that is, may all men acknowledge him as such; let the whole world know, that he neither can be unfaithful to his word, nor his promises; and that, on the contrary, all men of themselves have but lies and vanity for their portion. --- <i>That thou mayest be justified,</i> &c. The particle <i>that,</i> is not casual in this place, but only marks the event. Thy conduct shews that thou art faithful and true to thy promises, and that, notwithstanding the judgments of men, thou art always unchangeable and infallible. Thou art victorious, when judged by them; thou shewest them the falsity and injustice of their judgments. (Calmet) --- And that the infidelity of man, so far from affecting the fidelity of God, will only serve to set it off in a more striking and clearer light. (Bible de Vence)'
      v:005:
        - "ROM:3:5 | 5 | 5-6 | <i>But if our injustice,</i> &c. St. Paul here puts this objection, that if men's sins and iniquities, <i>make the justice of God commendable,</i> that is, make his justice more apparent and known; if the <i>truth of God,</i> as to his promises, be more discovered, praised, and glorified by our <i>lies,</i> that is, by our sins, how then can God blame, or punish men for sins, which contribute more to his honour? May we not say, (as some falsely pretend St. Paul said) <i>let us do evil things, that good things may come of them?</i> The apostle answers in short both this objection, and the calumny against him. As to the first; that though men's sins give an occasion to God to shew his justice, and make known his divine perfections, yet this will not excuse them from being justly condemned, and punished, when God shall judge the wicked world; for if that were a sufficient plea, God <i>could not judge</i> and condemn the wicked: so that as St. Chrysostom [1] observes, the apostle resolves their question, by asking another, and shews their reasoning absurd, by taking notice of another absurdity that follows from it. 2ndly. He tells them, they slander him, and his doctrine, by only telling them, they deserve to <i>be condemned</i> who say, <i>let us do evil that good may come of it: the damnation,</i> he says, <i>of such men is just.</i> (Witham)"
      v:009:
        - 'ROM:3:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>What</i> then <i>do we</i> Jews <i>excel</i> the Gentiles? He again turns his discourse against the Jews, by shewing that they have been sinners, as well as the Gentiles, notwithstanding the particular favours God had done to them, and not to the Gentiles: this he proves out of the psalms; and (ver. 19.) he shews, that these things were spoken <i>of them,</i> who were <i>under the law.</i> (Witham)'
      v:010:
        - "ROM:3:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>There is not any man just,</i> viz. by virtue either of the law of nature, or of the law of Moses; but only by faith and grace. (Challoner) --- The apostle here adduces a series of passages from the ancient Scripture, to convince both Jews and Gentiles, that not one amongst them was just, nor had any title to glory, on account of his good works. Not that a just man could not be found under the old law, or even before the law; an infinite number of passages of Scripture will shew the contrary: but he must be understood as speaking of man left to himself, as a son of Adam, conceived in sin, and brought forth a child of wrath. (Calmet) --- These crimes, enumerated by the apostle, are not mentioned as if found in each individual, but some of this black catalogue of crimes were found in one man; some in another; yet so that all had become infected with sin and iniquity, all had deserted the path of virtue. There was none just, none found, who feared or sought after God. (Estius) --- These texts of Scripture, though formerly, even before the times of St. Jerome and St. Augustine, they were found together in some Latin editions, viz. Psalm xiii. cannot be found united either in the Hebrew text, or Septuagint version, as St. Jerome affirms, in Præf. lib. xvi. commentar. in Isai. This, he says, all the Greek commentators allow. He says, that those who were ignorant of this apostle's art in uniting together the texts of different pasts of Scripture, upon finding no part where they were all together, placed them, without any authority, in that psalm whence the first part of the citation is taken. The words, <i>an open sepulchre,</i> are taken from Psalm xiii. (Hebrew text xiv.) the verse \"Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully,\" from Psalm v. \"The venom of asps is under their lips,\" from Psalm cxxxix. \"Whose mouth is full of curses and bitterness,\" from Psalm ix. \"Their feet are swift,\" &c. as far as, <i>there is no fear,</i> from Isaias chap. lix. \"There is not the fear of God before their eyes,\" from Psalm xxxv. (Estius)"
      v:017:
        - 'ROM:3:17 | 17 | 17 | St. Augustine says, that by the law of actions, is understood, that which teaches us what we have to do: by the law of faith, is meant faith itself, which obtains for us grace of performing what the law requires. The law of actions, then, is the old law, which contains the precept; the law of faith is the new law, which gives assistance to fulfil the law. (De Spir. & Lit. chap. iv.)'
      v:019:
        - 'ROM:3:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>And all the world may be made subject to God.</i> That is, God permitted these sins in all men, that sanctification and salvation might be from Christ only, the Redeemer of all men, so that neither Jew nor Gentile should be justified, but by the free and liberal gift of his grace. See St. Chrysostom.[2] (Witham) --- That the Jews might not say that these passages were to be understood of Gentiles, the apostle here assures them that they must be understood in the first place of the Jews themselves; for what the law speaketh, it speaketh to those who are under the law. If the Jews, then, were so guilty, the guilt of the Gentiles was far more enormous. Thus is every mouth stopped, and all the world must confess itself guilty before God. Let none then glory in their good works. (Calmet){JOIN}<b>Ver. 20. &c.</b> To the end of this chapter, the apostle shews that the Jews cannot be truly justified, and sanctified by the <i>works of the</i> written <i>law</i> of Moses only; that <i>a knowledge of sin,</i> or of what is sinful, came <i>by the law,</i> but if they did not comply with the precepts of the law, this knowledge made them more guilty. Now, at the coming of Christ, the <i>justice of God,</i> that is, the justice by which he made others just, and justified them, cannot be had without <i>faith in Christ,</i> and by the grace of our Redeemer Jesus Christ, whom God hath <i>proposed</i> to all, both Gentiles and Jews, as a sacrifice of[3] <i>propitiation</i> for the sins of all mankind, by <i>faith in his blood;</i> that is, by believing in him, who shed his blood and died for us on the cross. It is he alone, (ver. 26.) that is <i>the just one,</i> and the <i>justifier</i> of all. And as to this, <i>there is no distinction.</i> The Gentiles are justified and sanctified without the written law, and the Jews who have been under the law, cannot partake of <i>the justice of God,</i> that is, cannot be justified, sanctified, or saved, but by the faith and grace of Christ Jesus. St. Paul does not pretend that the virtue of faith alone will justify and save a man; nothing can be more opposite to the doctrine of the gospel, and of the apostles in many places, as hath been observed, and will be shewn hereafter. He tells us in this chapter (ver. 20. and 28.) that man is justified <i>without the works of the</i> written <i>law:</i> and he teaches us, that no works of the law of Moses, nor any works that a man does by the law of nature, are sufficient to justify a man, and save him of themselves, that is, unless they be joined with faith, and the grace of God. And when he seems to say, that men are justified or saved by faith, or by believing, as he says of Abraham in the next chapter, (ver. 3. and 5.) he never says (as some both ancient and later heretics have pretended) that <i>faith alone</i> is sufficient. And besides by faith, he understands the Christian faith and doctrine of Christ, as opposite to the law of Moses, to circumcision, and the ceremonies of that law, as it evidently appears by the design of the apostle, both in this epistle and in that to the Galatians. He teaches us in this epistle (chap. ii. 6.) that God will judge every man <i>according to his works:</i> (chap. ii. 13.) that "not the hearers of the law," but <i>the doers, shall be justified.</i> See also chap. vi. He tells the Galatians (chap. v. ver. 6.) that the faith, by which they must be saved, must be a faith working by charity. He also tells the Corinthians (1 Corinthians vii. 19.) that <i>circumcision is nothing, nor uncircumcision,</i> but the keeping of the commandments of God. That though a man should have a faith, that so he could remove mountains, it would avail him nothing without charity. How often does he tell us that they who commit such and such sins, shall not inherit or possess the kingdom of God? Does not St. James tell us, that faith without good <i>works is dead?</i> See chap. ii. Of this more hereafter. (Witham)'
      v:029:
        - 'ROM:3:29 | 29 | 29 | The apostle here tells us that all men are the creatures of God Almighty, and destined to eternal happiness. Neither was it necessary to be incorporated with the Jews by circumcision, to be made partakers of the justice of God. (Estius)'
      v:030:
        - "ROM:3:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>God who justifieth circumcision,</i> and also the uncircumcised by faith; that is, by the faith and religion of the new law, or by a faith working by charity, and joined with good words proceeding from faith. See the Council of Trent, Session 6. cap. viii. \"When the apostle says, that a man is <i>justified</i> by faith, and gratis, according to the perpetual consent of the Catholic Church, we are said to be justified by faith, because faith is the beginning and foundation of man's salvation, and the root of his justification, without which we cannot please God, nor be made his sons; and we are said to be justified gratis, because nothing of those things which go before justification, whether faith or works, are meritorious of the grace of justification.\" (Witham)"
      v:031:
        - 'ROM:3:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Do we then destroy the law through faith?</i> No: but <i>we establish the law.</i> See the words of Christ: (Matthew v. 17.) 1. Because the figures and types of the law of Moses, and the predictions of the prophets, are fulfilled. 2. Because Christians are now taught to fulfil the moral precepts, and the chief part of the law, with greater perfection, in the spirit of faith, charity, &c. (Witham)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'ROM:4:1 | 1 | 1 | The apostle proves what he had advanced in the last chapter, that the Jews cannot be justified by the works of the written law, nor by any works, unless joined with faith in the Messias, their Redeemer. This he shews by the example of Abraham, who is said to have been justified by believing; 2. and this was before he was circumcised; 3. and long before the law of Moses. Justification was then given without the works of that law. --- <i>What</i> advantage <i>shall we say, then, that Abraham hath found, who is our father according to the flesh?</i> This seems the true construction and sense: rather than what did he find according to the flesh, as some expound it. (Witham)'
      v:002:
        - 'ROM:4:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>If Abraham were justified by works,</i> or by his own works, he might <i>have glory,</i> and be commended <i>by men,</i> who judge only according to outward appearances; but not <i>with God:</i> that is, he could not be truly justified, so as to deserve a reward in heaven, without faith and the grace of God. (Witham) --- <i>Not with God.</i> Whatever glory or applause such works might procure from men, they would be of no value in the sight of God. (Challoner)'
      v:003:
        - "ROM:4:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>For what saith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.</i>[1] The Scripture, therefore, teacheth us that he became just by his faith. And as he had this faith by the grace of God, grace was the cause of his justification, and not any works without grace. And when it is said, <i>it was reputed to him,</i> we must not understand an imputation of being just without a true and interior justice: for to be reputed just in the sight of God, who sees the heart, and sanctifies the soul by his interior grace, is the only true justice that can make a man acceptable to God. As not to have our <i>sins imputed</i> in the sight of God, is to have them forgiven, and to be free from our sins. (Witham) --- <i>Reputed,</i> &c. By God, who <i>reputeth</i> nothing otherwise than it is. However, we may gather from this word, that when we are justified, our justification proceedeth from God's free grace and bounty; and not from any efficacy which any act of ours could have of its own nature, abstracting from God's grace. (Challoner)"
      v:004:
        - "ROM:4:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Now to him that worketh,</i> &c. a reward may be looked upon <i>as due</i> for his works, and not bestowed upon him as a free gift; but when it is said he <i>believed and was justified,</i> (this belief or faith was always a liberal gift of God) and when no mention is made of his works, it appears that such a justification and sanctification are not from the works of the written law, nor from any works he could do of himself, but that they are <i>according to the purpose,</i> or decree <i>of grace.</i> (Witham) --- Such a man, says the apostle, challenges his reward as a <i>debt,</i> due to his own performance; whereas he who <i>worketh not,</i> that is, who presumeth not upon any works done by his own strength; but seeketh justice through faith and grace, is freely justified by God's grace. (Challoner)"
      v:005:
        - 'ROM:4:5 | 5 | 5 | Abraham, before his vocation, was an idolater, according to Josephus; (Jewish Antiquities, lib. i. chap. viii.) according to some of the Rabbins, and as the Scripture itself seems to insinuate, Josue chap. xxiv; Isaias xliii; Wisdom x; Judith v. He did not then merit his vocation to the faith by his works. But when God had called him, and made him depart from his country, when he promised to him an innumerable posterity, Abraham believed in his promises, and it was reputed to him unto justice, that his faith and his justice were the pure gift of God. His faith was not a dead and speculative faith only, but an active faith, a faith animated by charity, as appears from the sequel of his life. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - "ROM:4:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>As David,</i> &c. That is, David accounted a man happy in being justified by God's grace, and not by his own works, when he said: <i>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven</i> by the mercies of God, <i>and whose sins are covered;</i> that is, covered so as to be no more, even in the sight of God. (Witham)"
      v:007:
        - 'ROM:4:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</i> That is, blessed are those who, by doing penance, have obtained pardon and remission of their sins, and also are <i>covered;</i> that is, newly clothed with the habit of grace, and vested with the stole of charity. (Challoner) --- When it is said that the sins of man are covered, we must not imagine that they still remain, but on account of the goodness of God will not be punished, as the Lutherans contend; for the justice of God could not suffer this: but by it we must understand that they are entirely blotted out, and neither exist, nor are considered any longer by God. Still, we must not conclude that man is blessed, as soon as sin is remitted; since the same psalmist, in another place, ascribes happiness to man when he walks in the law of the Lord, and when he keeps judgment and does justice. (Psalms i; cv; and cviii.) And our Saviour says, <i>If you know these things, blessed shall you be if you do them.</i> (St. John xiii.) (Estius) --- Moreover, if sins were never blotted out, but only covered, why did the royal prophet pray to the Almighty, saying: <i>blot out all mine iniquities;</i> and in different parts of the 50th psalm and psalm cviii, speaking of the egregious sinner, he says: <i>let the sin of his mother not be blotted out;</i> which would mean nothing at all, if sins were never blotted out? (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'ROM:4:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.</i> That is, blessed is the man who hath retained his baptismal innocence, that no grievous sin can be imputed to him. And likewise, blessed is the man who, after falling into sin hath done penance, and leads a virtuous life by frequenting the sacraments necessary for obtaining the grace to prevent a relapse, that sin is no more imputed to him. (Challoner)'
      v:009:
        - "ROM:4:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>This blessedness,</i> by which a man's sins are forgiven, and his soul truly justified, was promised, and is given to the uncircumcised Gentiles, as well as to the circumcised Jews, by the faith and grace of Christ; as Abraham was justified, when he was in the <i>state of uncircumcision.</i> (Witham)"
      v:010:
        - 'ROM:4:10 | 10 | 10 | In effect, Abraham received circumcision a year only before the birth of Isaac; whereas he had received the promises and justification more than 25 years before, when the Almighty caused him to depart from Mesopotamia. (Calmet) --- Therefore he was justified by faith and grace, which is common both to the circumcised and uncircumcised. (Menochius)'
      v:011:
        - 'ROM:4:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>And he received,</i> after he was justified, <i>circumcision,</i> as a <i>seal of the justice</i> of faith, which he had before when he believed. Circumcision, therefore, in Abraham, was as a <i>seal</i> and testimony of the justice which he had already by faith: though circumcision was chiefly given to Abraham and his posterity, as a sign or seal of that alliance which God made with Abraham, and his seed, to shew he had made choice of them for his elect people. (Witham)'
      v:012:
        - 'ROM:4:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>And might be the father of circumcision.</i> The apostle here tells them that Abraham is the father of all true believers, uncircumcised as well as circumcised, and all that believe in Christ, his seed, in whom God promised to <i>bless all nations,</i> are the spiritual sons of Abraham, and partake of the blessings promised to him in his posterity: nor can the circumcised be his true and spiritual children, unless they follow the <i>footsteps of his faith,</i> by which he was justified, when he believed the promises which God made to him before that circumcision was instituted; to wit, that he and Sara should have a son, when they were naturally past the age of having children, and that in his posterity all the world <i>should be blessed,</i> that is, in Christ. (Witham)'
      v:013:
        - "ROM:4:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Of the world,</i> &c. By the world, some understand the land of Chanaan, which is sometimes meant by the whole earth, particularly in the times of David and Solomon, when they ruled over the neighbouring nations. But others think that the apostle alludes to the passage of Genesis, where the Almighty promises that in his (Abraham's) seed, all the nations of the earth should be blessed; which promise extends much beyond the narrow limits of Chanaan. In fine, it may be understood in a spiritual sense, of his dignity of father of all the faithful; which makes him, in a manner, master of the whole world, since his spiritual children, spread through the whole world, have the universe for their inheritance. (Calmet) --- Postula a me, et dabo tibi Gentes hæreditatem tuam et possessionem tuam terminos terræ. (Psalm ii. 8.) (Haydock) --- It was by Christ that Abraham was to <i>be heir</i> of the world, in as much as the spiritual kingdom of Christ should be spread over all the world. And this of one who was of the seed of David, being heir of the world, was not <i>by the law,</i> or by virtue of the law, which was not given to Moses till 400 years after. (Witham)"
      v:014:
        - 'ROM:4:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>For if they, who are of the law, be heirs: faith is made void, the promise is made of no effect.</i> That is, if the Jews, who are under the law, are the only heirs of the blessings promised, it will follow that the faith which Abraham had before the circumcision, and before the law, was of no value, which I have shewn to be false. And, secondly, it will follow that the promise made to him, that <i>in him all nations should be blessed,</i> is also null. (Witham)'
      v:015:
        - "ROM:4:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>For the law worketh wrath,</i> not of itself, nor by the intention of the lawgiver, but in as much as it is the occasion of greater punishments, when persons <i>transgress</i> it knowingly. (Witham) --- The law abstracting from faith and grace, worketh wrath occasionally, by being an occasion of many transgressions, which provoke God's wrath. (Challoner)"
      v:016:
        - 'ROM:4:16 | 16 | 16 | There are two kinds of children of Abraham, to whom alone these promises are made; the one is according to the flesh, the other according to the spirit. The former of these had no more part in the promises made to him and his seed than the Gentiles, unless they imitated the fidelity and obedience of their father. (Calmet) --- It is in this sense of spiritual father, that the [Catholic] priest at the altar, speaking in the name of the faithful, calls Abraham our patriarch. (Estius)'
      v:018:
        - 'ROM:4:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Who, against hope, believed in hope,</i> or with hope. That is, Abraham, against all probability of human hopes, still hoped in God, says St. Chrysostom, that he should have a son by Sara: and in this, he <i>was not weak in faith.</i> Therefore <i>it,</i> that is, is great faith, <i>was imputed to him unto justice:</i> and also our faith shall be <i>imputed to us unto justice, or make us truly just, by believing in Christ,</i> &c. (Witham)'
      v:019:

      v:025:
        - 'ROM:4:25 | 25 | 25 | The eternal Father delivered his Son to death, to expiate our offences; he raised him from the dead for our justification. His death is our redemption; his resurrection is the principal object of our faith. Our faith in the resurrection, is imputed unto justice, as was the faith of Abraham in the promises of God. The apostle here seems to refer our faith and justification only to the resurrection, not to the exclusion of other mysteries of religion, which are all, and every one of them, the objects of our faith. But the resurrection is, as it were, the zeal and consummation of the rest; it eminently includes in itself all the others. (Calmet)'

        - 'ROM:5:1 | 1 | 1 | The apostle proceeds in this chapter to shew how great a benefit it is to be truly justified by the coming of Christ. --- <i>Let us have</i> [1] <i>peace with God.</i> That is, says St. Chrysostom, by laying aside all contentions. Or let us have peace with God by sinning no more. And this peace we may have under the greatest <i>tribulations,</i> which conduce to our greater good, to an increase in virtues, in patience, in hope, in the love of God, &c. (Witham)'
      v:003:
        - 'ROM:5:3 | 3 | 3 | We glory in spirit in the afflictions, oppression, and persecution, which we suffer as Christians, esteeming them a great blessing. Thus the apostles went rejoicing from before the council, because they had been thought worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus. (Acts v.) And St. James (chap. i.) says: Think it the greatest joy when you fall into various temptations: (i.e. tribulations) for these sufferings greatly serve to confirm the elect in the hopes which they have of enjoying the glory of the world to come. (Estius)'
      v:005:
        - "ROM:5:5 | 5 | 5 | God having prevented us with his gifts when we did not at all deserve them, having showered upon us the blessings of faith, charity, patience, and fidelity, we cannot but have the greatest confidence that after this pledge and assurance of his good will towards us, he well finish the work he has begun, and bring us to his heavenly kingdom. (Calmet) --- Not only the gift of the Holy Spirit, but the Spirit himself, is given to us, who resides in our soul as in his own temple, who sanctifies it, and makes it partaker of his divine love. (Menochius){JOIN}<b>Ver. 6. &c.</b> <i>Why did Christ...die for the ungodly?</i> He shews Christ's great mercy and love for mankind, that he would die for us, who were sinners, and consequently his enemies. How few are there that will lay down their lives for a <i>just man,</i> or for a just cause? --- <i>Perhaps for a good man.</i> That is, for another, who has been good to him, his friend or benefactor, we may find one that will expose or lay down his life. But Christ, in <i>due time,</i> appointed by the divine decree, died for <i>sinners, for</i> us all. And if we have been reconciled to God, and justified by his death; now being made the children of God, and his friends, we may with greater confidence hope to be saved. (Witham) --- The text of the Greek is as follows: <i>For when we were weak, he gave us our Lord Jesus Christ to redeem us;</i> shewing how much God loved us, to perform such stupendous acts of love in our behalf. But the reading of the Vulgate is conformable to St. Irenæus, (lib. iii. chap. 18.) and to the commentaries of this epistle, which have been published under the name of St. Ambrose, and St. Jerome. (Calmet) --- St. Augustine says, those whom the apostle first calls weak, he afterwards calls impious, hos dixit infirmos quos impios. (Ep. lix. ad Paulinum.) --- St. Jerome, and other fathers and commentators, explain the Greek text of this verse as follows: Scarcely would any one die for a just cause; for who would ever think of dying in defence of injustice? Others explain it thus: Scarcely a single man would die for one that was wicked and unjust: for we can hardly find a person ready to lay down his life for a good man; his friend and benefactor, who has been kind to him.

Nor does St. Chrysostom deny original sin, though in this place he expounds it that all by Adam's sin were made guilty of death and punishments. But how could they deserve these, had they not sinned in Adam? (Witham)"

        - "ROM:5:13 | 13 | 13-14 | <i>Until the law, sin was in the world.</i> That is, from Adam's fall, both <i>original</i> sin and <i>actual</i> sins truly infected all mankind. (Witham) --- <i>Not imputed.</i> That is, men knew not, or made no account of sin; neither was it <i>imputed</i> to them, in the manner it was afterwards, when they transgressed the known written law of God. (Challoner) --- All were conceived and born in sin, in what we call original sin, and liable to <i>death,</i> even infants, who were not come to the use of reason, and consequently could not sin after the <i>similitude of the transgression of Adam,</i> or by imitating his sin, but were born in sin: and besides this, all manner of actual sins, which men committed by their own perverse will, reigned every where in the world. But before the law these sins were <i>not imputed,</i> that is, were not declared sins, that deserved such punishments as were ordained by the law. --- <i>Adam, who is a figure of him that was to come.</i> That is, of Christ, whom the apostle calls the <i>last Adam,</i> 1 Corinthians xv. 45. But he was a figure by <i>contraries.</i> By the first Adam, sin and death entered into the world; by Christ, justice and life. (Witham){JOIN}<b>Ver. 15. &c.</b> <i>But not as the offence, so also is the gift,</i> or the benefits which mankind receive by their Redeemer, Jesus Christ. For St. Paul here shews that the graces which Christ came to bestow upon men, and offers to all, are much greater than the evils which the sin of <i>one man,</i> Adam, caused. 1. Because, <i>if by the offence</i> of that one man, Adam, <i>many,</i> i.e. <i>all died</i> by original sin that descended from Adam, (the blessed Virgin mother by a special privilege being always excepted) <i>much more the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many,</i>[3] the comparison does not imply that more in number receive the grace of Christ, than were infected with sin; but that they who receive the graces which are offered to all, receive greater benefits than were the damages caused by the sin of Adam. <i>For the judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation,</i> or so as to make all guilty of one sin, that is, of original sin; and for other actual sins, men committed them by their own proper will; whereas the <i>grace of Christ</i> justifies men from <i>many sins;</i> that is, also from all sins which they have committed by their own malice. 2. Because by <i>it,</i> that is, by the <i>offence of one man, death reigned</i> in the world, and made all men liable to damnation; yet now by the incarnation of Christ, (which would not have been, had not Adam sinned) all they who are justified by the grace of their Redeemer, have Christ God and man for their head: he is become the head of that same mystical body which is his Church: they are exalted to the dignity of being the brothers of Christ, the Son of God; they are made joint heirs with him of the kingdom of heaven, and so by the grace of Christ have a greater dignity in this world, and shall be exalted to a greater and more eminent degree of glory in the kingdom of his glory for all eternity; which hath given occasion to the Church, in her liturgy, to cry out, as it were with a transport of joy, O happy fault, which hath procured us such and so great a Redeemer! See St. Chrysostom,[4] hom. x. (Witham)"

St. Chrysostom takes notice that it is not said the law was given, but only that it <i>entered in,</i> as it were by the by, and only for a certain time, till our happy redemption, reconciliation, and justification by Jesus Christ. (Witham) --- <i>That sin might abound.</i> Not as if the law were given purposely for sin to abound; but that it so happened, through man's perversity, taking occasion of sinning more, from the prohibition of sin. (Challoner) --- <i>Where sin abounded.</i> Grace abounded in the elect; for the apostle does not say that grace abounded in every place where iniquity had abounded; but he says indefinitely <i>where,</i> that is, in many places where sin abounded, grace hath abounded also. (Estius) --- The Jews and Gentiles having become sensible of their weakness and misery, the Almighty, in his mercy, sent his only Son to enrich both the one and the other with his graces. The Gentiles were in the more deplorable case, and received the greatest abundance of grace; as may be seen from the great number of conversions wrought amongst them in so short a time in every part of the world. (Calmet) --- In the Greek it is {GREEK:START pareiselthe}παρηισηλθη{GREEK:END}, entered in by stealth, as it were, and for a time, till the preaching of the gospel. (Menochius)"

        - "ROM:6:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?</i> He puts and rejects the same objection as before. (Chap. iii. ver. 7.) And having set forth in the last chapter the grace and advantages by Christ's coming, he now exhorts them to avoid sinning, and live in the grace of God. (Witham)"
      v:002:
        - "ROM:6:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Dead to sin,</i> &c. We are then dead to sin when we neither live in sin by serving it, nor sin lives in us by reigning; in this case, how can we still live in it by yielding to its desires? St. Augustine (chap. vi. de spiritu et litera) thus explains the passage: when grace has caused us to die to sin; if we live again in it, we must be exceedingly ungrateful to grace. (Estius){JOIN}<b>Ver. 3. &c.</b> <i>We...are baptized in his death.</i> Greek, <i>unto his death.</i> The apostle here alludes to the manner of administering the sacrament of baptism, which was then done by immersion or by plunging the person baptized under the water, in which he finds a resemblance of Christ's death and burial under ground, and of his resurrection to an immortal life. So must we after baptism rise to lead a quite different life: having been also, when we were baptized and made Christians, <i>planted</i> as branches ingrafted in Christ, let us endeavour to bring forth the fruits of a virtuous life. (Witham) --- <i>Old man...body of sin.</i> Our corrupt state, subject to sin and concupiscence, coming to us from Adam, is called our <i>old man</i>, as our state, reformed in and by Christ, is called the <i>new man.</i> And the vices and sins which then ruled in us, are named <i>the body of sin.</i> (Challoner) --- The old and sinful man we must look upon as crucified with him, and the <i>body of sin,</i> or our sinful body, destroyed. We must look upon ourselves as dead to sin, and that we must sin no more, as <i>Christ</i> being <i>once risen,</i> dies no more. (Witham)"
      v:007:
        - 'ROM:6:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>He that is dead is justified from sin.</i>[1] Some translate, is freed from sin: this is true; but perhaps it is better to retain the word <i>justified,</i> which is observed to be a law-word used in courts of justice, where to be <i>justified</i> is to be acquitted, so that a man cannot be questioned again on that account; and so are sinners, when their sins are forgiven. (Witham)'
      v:010:
        - "ROM:6:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>For in that he died to sin.</i> But the sense must be for sins, or to destroy other men's sins, he himself being incapable of sinning. (Witham)"
      v:012:
        - 'ROM:6:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Let not sin, therefore, reign,</i> &c. He compares <i>sin</i> and <i>justice</i> to two kings, or generals, under one of which every man fights in this world. Sin is the tyrant, under which fight the wicked, and make their minds and their members the instruments, or <i>arms</i> of iniquity to sin, when they follow and yield to their disorderly <i>lusts.</i> But he exhorts them to live so as to make the powers of their souls, and their <i>members, instruments</i> or <i>arms of justice</i> to God, to fight under God, their lawful king, and under the banner of his justice. (Witham)'
      v:014:
        - 'ROM:6:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>You are not under the law</i> of Moses, as some of you were before: but <i>now you</i> are all under <i>grace,</i> or the law of grace, where you may find pardon for your sins. But take care not to abuse this grace of pardon offered you, nor multiply your sins, and defer your conversion, as some may do, by presuming, that after all, by the merits of Christ, you can find pardon. This, says Tertullian, is the greatest ingratitude, to continue wicked, because God is good. Reflect that you make yourselves servants of him whom you obey. By yielding to your passions, you become <i>slaves to sin.</i> If you keep your obedience to the law of Christ, and to his doctrine, <i>the form of which you have delivered to you</i> by the gospel, you are the happy <i>servants of justice,</i> and the servants of God, who is justice itself. (Witham)'
      v:017:
        - 'ROM:6:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Thanks be to God,</i> &c. He thanks God, not because they had been in sin, but because after having been so long under the slavery of sin, they had now been converted from their heart, and with their whole strength gave themselves to that form of doctrine to which they had been conducted by the gospel. He returns God thanks for their obedience to the faith, because this obedience of the human will is the work and gift of God, that so no one may glory in his sight. (Ephesians ii.) (Estius)'
      v:019:
        - 'ROM:6:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>I speak a human thing,</i>[2] or I am proposing to you what is according to human strength and ability assisted by the grace of God, with a due regard to the <i>weakness</i> and <i>infirmity of your flesh.</i> The sense, according to St. Chrysostom is this, that the apostle having told them they must be <i>dead</i> to sin, <i>lead</i> a <i>new life,</i> &c. he now encourages them to it, by telling them, that what is required of them is not above their human strength, as it is assisted by those graces which God offers them, and which they have received. Where we may observe that these words, <i>I speak a human thing,</i> are not the same, nor to be taken in the same sense, as chap. iii. 6. when he said, <i>I speak after a human way,</i> or I speak like men. (Witham) --- What I ask of you, Christian Romans, is, that you so earnestly labour for your sanctification as to improve daily in virtue, as formerly you plunged every day deeper and deeper into vice. (Menochius)'
      v:020:
        - 'ROM:6:20 | 20 | 20-22 | <i>You were free from justice;</i> that is, says St. Chrysostom, you lived as no ways subject to justice, nor obedient to the law and precepts of God: an unhappy freedom, a miserable liberty, worse than the greatest slavery, <i>the end of which is death,</i> eternal death: of which sins with great reason <i>you are now ashamed,</i> when you are become the <i>servants of God,</i> and obedient to him, for which you will receive <i>the fruit</i> and reward of <i>everlasting life in heaven.</i> (Witham)'
      v:023:
        - "ROM:6:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>For the wages,</i> which the tyrant <i>sin</i> gives to his soldiers and slaves, is eternal death; but the wages, the pay, the reward, which God gives to those that fight under him, is <i>everlasting life;</i> which, though a reward of our past labours, as it is often called in the Scriptures, is still <i>a grace,</i>[3] or free gift; because if our works are good, or deserve a reward in heaven, it is God's grace that makes them deserve it. For, as St. Augustine says, when God crowns our works, he crowns his own gifts. (Witham)"

        - 'ROM:7:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>As long as it liveth;</i> or, as long as he liveth. (Challoner) --- This seems the literal construction, rather than as long as <i>he,</i> the man, liveth. For St. Paul here compares the law (which in the Greek is in the masculine gender) to a husband, whom a wife cannot quit, nor be married to another, as long as the husband liveth, without being an adulteress: but if the <i>husband be dead,</i> (as the law of Moses is now dead, and no longer obligatory after the publishing of the new law of Christ) the people that were Jews, and under the Jewish law, are now free from that former husband, to wit, the written law of Moses. Nay, this people also are <i>become dead to the law,</i> (ver. 4.) because the law itself is dead <i>by the body of Christ,</i> or, as in the Greek, by reason of the body of Christ offered and sacrificed for you, and for all on the cross: so that now you must look upon yourselves as spiritually married to him: which agrees with what follows, <i>that you may belong to another,</i> (in the Greek, to <i>another husband</i>) to Christ, who <i>is risen from the dead,</i> and is now the spouse of your souls. (Witham)'
      v:005:
        - 'ROM:7:5 | 5 | 5 | For <i>when we were in the flesh;</i> i.e. lived according to the flesh, <i>the passions of sins, which were by the law:</i> he does not say, as St. Chrysostom observes, that they were <i>caused</i> by the law, but only <i>were by it,</i> meaning that they were occasioned by the knowledge of the law, but properly caused by ourselves, and our corrupt inclinations, that were <i>wrought in our members,</i> rather than did work. (Witham)'
      v:006:
        - 'ROM:7:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>But now are loosed from the law of death,</i> by which many understand from the law of Moses; so called, because it could not of itself give the life of grace, and occasioned death. Others expound these words, <i>free from the law of death,</i> that is, from sins, which before they had been guilty of, and which made them deserve eternal death. (Witham)'
      v:007:
        - 'ROM:7:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Is the law</i> (of Moses) <i>sin? God forbid.</i> The apostle declares, that the law itself was far from being sinful; on the contrary, that it was <i>good, spiritual, holy:</i> but, saith he, I should not know <i>concupiscence</i> to be sinful, unless the law said: <i>thou shalt not covet:</i> by which it is made known to every one, that sins of thought consented to, and evil desires, are sins. (Witham)'
      v:008:
        - 'ROM:7:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Sin, taking occasion.</i> Sin, or concupiscence, which is called <i>sin,</i> because it is from sin, and leads to sin, which was asleep before, was awakened by the prohibition; the law not being the cause thereof, nor properly <i>giving occasion</i> to it: but <i>occasion being taken</i> by our corrupt nature to resist the commandment laid upon us. (Challoner) --- <i>Sin.</i> The apostle here calls concupiscence by the name of sin; because it is the consequence and punishment of it, and drags us along to sin. This takes occasion from the precept of the law to induce us to transgress it; for we are naturally inclined to do what is forbidden. --- <i>Nitimur in vetitum</i> --- which is the offspring of a disorderly love of liberty and independence. Without the law sin was dead, because concupiscence had nothing to rouse and trouble it. It was like a torrent which rolled rapidly, without resistance in its channel, but as soon as the law came and put an obstacle, it began to spread itself far and wide, and commit the strangest ravages. Or it may be explained thus: without the law sin was dead; not being known to the world, and not imputed to us as a transgression. He speaks here of the transgressions of the written law, not of the law of nature, of which each one has a sufficient knowledge to render him inexcusable, whenever he transgresses it. (Calmet) --- <i>Without the law sin was dead;</i> that is, many sins were so little known, that before the written law they seemed no sins; not but that, at all times, reason and conscience shewed many things to be sinful and ill done, so that whosoever acted against these lights could not be excused. See what St. Paul says of the heathen philosophers, chap. i. (Witham){JOIN}<b>Ver. 9. &c.</b> <i>I lived some time without the law;</i> i.e. without the knowledge of the law. This some understand of St. Paul in the time of his childhood, before he came to the knowledge of what was forbidden by any law. But the exposition, which agrees with the rest of this chapter, is this; that St. Paul, though he seems to speak of himself, yet represents the condition of any person that lived before the written law was given: <i>but when the commandment came,</i> after that the written law was given, and its precepts came to my knowledge, <i>then sin revived,</i> by giving me a perfect knowledge: and by transgressing those precepts, I became more guilty and without excuse. --- <i>I died:</i> i.e. became guilty by transgression of the known law, and guilty of eternal death: <i>and the commandments</i> or precepts, <i>which were unto life,</i> which were good in themselves, and designed to direct me what I was to do, and what I was to avoid in order to obtain eternal life, <i>were found to be unto death to me,</i> but by my own fault; and <i>occasionally</i> only, from the <i>commandments</i> of the law and the knowledge of them, when with full knowledge I transgressed them. Thus I was <i>seduced</i> by sin, which with it brought death, though the law and the commandment (ver. 12) were in themselves <i>holy, and</i> just, <i>and good.</i> They could not but be good, as St. Chrysostom says, their author being the true God, and not any evil principle or cause, that was the author of evils, as the impious Manicheans pretended. We might as well, says St. Chrysostom, find fault with the tree of life [the tree of knowledge of good and evil?] and the forbidden fruit in Paradise, which was not the cause, but only the occasion of our misery, when Adam eat of it. It cannot then be said, <i>that that which was good,</i> (to wit, the <i>law</i> ) <i>was made death to me,</i> or the cause of my death; but <i>sin,</i> and my unresisted sinful inclinations, <i>that it might appear sin,</i> or that it might evidently appear how great an evil sin is, <i>by that which is good,</i> (i.e. by the transgression of the law which is good) <i>wrought</i> and brought <i>death to me,</i> that by the <i>occasion</i> of the precepts given and known, <i>sin might become sinful above measure.</i> He speaks of sin as it were of a certain person; and the sense is, that sin, which was in my corrupt nature, might <i>become sinful above measure,</i> when it led me into all manner of disorders and excess, which I yielded to. (Witham)'

        - 'ROM:7:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>That it may appear sin,</i> or <i>that sin may appear;</i> viz. to be the monster it is, which is even capable to take occasion from that which is good to work death. (Challoner)'
      v:014:
        - 'ROM:7:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>I am carnal, sold under sin,</i> a slave subject to sinful inclinations, which are only properly sins when they are consented to by our free-will. There has been a great dispute both among the ancient and later interpreters, whether St. Paul from this verse to the end of the chapter speaks of a person remaining in sin, either under the law of nature or of the written law, (which was once the opinion of St. Augustine) or whether he speaks of a person regenerated by baptism, and in the state of grace in the new law, and even of himself when he was a faithful servant of God. This is the opinion of St. Augustine in many of his later writings against the Pelagians, for which he also cites St. Hilary, St. Gregory of Nazianzus, and St. Ambrose. It is also the opinion of St. Jerome, (Ep. ad Eustochium de custod. Virg.) of St. Gregory the great, of Ven. Bede, and the more approved opinion, according to which the apostle here by sin does not understand that which is properly speaking a sin, or sinful, but only speaks of sin improperly such, that is of a corrupt inclination, of a rebellious nature corrupted by original sin, of a strife betwixt the spirit and the flesh, which remains for a trial in the most virtuous persons: of which see again St. Paul, Galatians v. 17. We may take notice that the apostle before spoke of what he <i>was</i> and what <i>he had been,</i> but now speaks in the present time of what he <i>is,</i> and what he <i>doth.</i> (Witham) --- The law is styled <i>spiritual:</i> 1st, because it prescribes what appertains to the spirit, and to the spiritual man: i.e. to follow virtue and shun vice: 2nd, because it directs man to the worship of God, which is spirit and truth: 3rd, because it cannot be fulfilled by spiritual men, unless by spirit and grace: 4th, because it directs the spirit of man and disposes him properly towards God, towards his neighbour, and towards himself: and lastly, because the law spiritually received and understood, leads and prepares men for the evangelical law, which is the law of grace and spirit. (Menochius)'
      v:015:
        - 'ROM:7:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>For that which I work, I understand not.</i> To <i>know,</i> or <i>understand</i> is often, in the style of the Scriptures, the same as to approve or love: so the sense here is: I <i>approve not</i> what I do, that is, what happens to me in my <i>sensitive part,</i> in my imagination, or in the members of my body, which indeed the just man rather suffers than does; and this is the sense, by what immediately follows, <i>the evil which I hate, that I do,</i> i.e. that I suffer, being against my will; and <i>I do that which I would not.</i> (Witham) --- <i>I do not that good which I will,</i> &c. The apostle here describes the disorderly motions of passion and concupiscence; which oftentimes in us get the start of reason, and by means of which even good men suffer in the inferior appetite what their will abhors: and are much hindered in the accomplishment of the desires of their spirit and mind. But these evil motions, (though they are called the <i>law of sin,</i> because they come from original sin, and violently tempt and incline to sin) as long as the will does not consent to them, are not sins, because they are not voluntary. (Challoner)'
      v:017:
        - 'ROM:7:17 | 17 | 17-18 | <i>Now then it is no more I that do it: To will good is present with me.</i> These expressions all shew that he speaks of temptations that affect the sense only, the imagination, or the members of the body, but to which the mind and the will give no consent, but retain an aversion to them; and so long they never can be truly and properly sins, which must be with full deliberation and consent. (Witham) --- The apostle here means to say, that he knew by experience that evil and not good dwelt within him, according to the flesh. He does not contradict this passage when he says elsewhere, that our members are the temples of the Holy Ghost: (1 Corinthians iii. 6.[16.?] &c.) for good cannot be found in our flesh, inasmuch as it is corrupted by sin; whence our Saviour says, "What is born of flesh, is flesh." (John iii.) But good is in our body, when our members under the influence of the soul, renewed by the Holy Ghost residing in it, are employed in good works. The meaning of this passage is, that although now healed and renewed by grace, he could have a perfect desire of doing good; yet still on account of the evil of concupiscence dwelling in his flesh, he found not himself able to perform all the good he wished, because concupiscence was always urging him on to evil against his will. (Estius)'
      v:022:
        - "ROM:7:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>I am delighted with the law of God according to the inward man.</i> As long as the inward man, or man's interior, is right, all is right. --- (I perceive another law in my <i>members, fighting,</i> and different <i>from the law of my mind:</i> this is true in any man just striving against and resisting temptations, but not of the sinner, whose mind also and will consent to them. A man can never lose God's favour and grace, unless his mind and interior consent. --- These <i>hold me</i> as it were <i>captive in the law of sin,</i> or sinful inclinations, but which are <i>in the members</i> only. I cry out, <i>who shall deliver me from the body of this death,</i> from this mortal body with its sinful lusts, which if consented to would bring <i>death</i> to the soul? Nothing but the <i>grace</i> of Jesus Christ can secure me from such temptations, and by freeing me from this body, can make me perfectly happy; which cannot be hoped for in this life. But I have still this greatest of consolations, that I myself, <i>with my mind</i> and will, still serve God, and remain firm in obedience <i>to his laws;</i> but with the <i>flesh,</i> or in the flesh, I am subject <i>to the law</i> of sin, i.e. of sinful inclinations. --- We must avoid here two heretical errors; that of those late pretended reformers, who denying man's free will, hold the commandments of God impossible, even to a just man. See also the first heretical proposition of Jansenius. Next we must detest the late abominable error of those called <i>Quietists,</i> who blushed not to say that a man might yield and abandon himself to the most shameful disorders of the flesh, pretending that it was not they themselves, but sin and the devil that caused these abominations in their flesh. St. Augustine foresaw this frivolous excuse: (lib. i. de. nup. and Concup. chap. xxviii.) \"That man (saith he) is in a grievous mistake, who, consenting to the concupiscence of the flesh, and to do what the flesh prompts him to, thinks he can still say: It is not I that do that,\" &c. (Witham)"

Concupiscence is not sin. And they who have received a spiritual birth in Jesus Christ by baptism, and have remained faithful to the grace of their justification, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit, shall receive a recompense proportionate to their combats and labours.

(Witham)'
      v:003:
        - 'ROM:8:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,</i> not in sinful flesh, (because the Son of God could not sin) hath now done; <i>even of sin</i> hath <i>condemned sin in the flesh.</i> That is, <i>in</i> or <i>by</i> his flesh, which was offered on the cross, hath <i>condemned</i> the tyrant <i>sin,</i> as guilty of so many sins, and hath destroyed his tyranny, where the apostle speaks of sin, as it were of a certain person or tyrant. (Witham)'
      v:004:
        - "ROM:8:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>That the justification of the law.</i> That is, that was aimed at, but never attained to, by the written law, <i>might</i> now <i>be fulfilled in us;</i> that is, that we, by the grace of Christ, may be enabled to fulfil and comply with the law, and its moral precepts, by walking according to the spirit of Christ. (Witham){JOIN}<b>Ver. 5. &c.</b> <i>For they who are according to the flesh.</i> That is, who live according to the false, vain, and deceitful maxims and customs of carnal men, which he also calls the <i>prudence of the</i> flesh: and this prudence he calls <i>death,</i> as leading men to eternal death. Such carnal men <i>relish</i> nothing else but such pleasures. But they <i>who are</i> and live <i>according to the spirit, mind the things which are of the spirit,</i> fix their hearts on the things that belong to God, and his service; and this <i>wisdom of the spirit,</i> in which they experience much greater pleasure, leads them to eternal <i>life,</i> and to eternal <i>peace</i> in the enjoyment of God. The false <i>wisdom</i> of <i>the flesh</i> is an enemy of God, <i>cannot be subject to the law of God,</i> because the maxims of the flesh, and of the world, are so opposite to those of the gospel, and to the doctrine of Christ. (Witham) --- They who are subject to the flesh, by having their affections fixed on the things of the flesh, that is, carnal men, whilst they are such, cannot please God: for this prudence of the flesh makes them the enemies of God. (Estius) --- <i>If Christ,</i> or <i>the spirit of Christ,</i> which he also (ver. 9.) calls <i>the spirit of God,</i> as being one and the same, <i>dwell in you,</i> and direct you, <i>the body indeed is dead because of sin;</i> that is, is mortal, and liable to death, the consequence of Adam's sin; but <i>the spirit</i> and the soul liveth by the life of grace, <em>by reason of justification:</em> that is, because she hath been justified and sanctified by the merits of Christ. And <em>the spirit</em> of God, who raised <i>Jesus</i> to life, will also raise all who remain sanctified by the grace of Christ to a happy resurrection. (Witham){JOIN}<b>Ver. 14. &c.</b> They are the sons of God, by this new grace of adoption, by which also they call God, <i>Abba;</i> that is to say, <i>Father,</i> whereas under the former law of Moses, God rather governed his people <i>by fear;</i> they were his <i>servants,</i> we are his <i>sons;</i> and if sons, also <i>the heirs of God,</i> with the promise of an eternal inheritance in his kingdom, <i>provided we suffer</i> for Christ's sake, as he suffered for us. And surely the short sufferings in this world have no proportion, nor can be put in balance with the <i>future</i> endless glory, which is promised and prepared for us in heaven. (Witham) --- <i>Abba</i> is a Syriac word, which signifies my father. This is properly the word of free and noble children; for amongst the Hebrews, the children of slaves were not allowed to call their fathers <i>Abba,</i> nor their mothers <i>Imma.</i> This kind of expression was very rarely used under the old law. The Hebrews called the Almighty their Lord, their God, their Salvation, their King, their Protector, their Glory, &c. but seldom their father, scarcely ever, except in the case of Solomon, who was a particular figure of the Messias, the true Son of God. On this account God said to him: \"He shall call me Father and God; and I will be to him a Father, and will treat as my first-born.\" But it is the property of the Christian to call the Almighty his Father with confidence indeed, yet tempered with a filial awe; remembering at the same time that he is his judge. (Calmet) --- Mat. Polus says that not any one of the just dared to call God, my <i>Father,</i> before the coming of Christ, as this favour was reserved for the time of the gospel. (In this location.) (Haydock) --- St. Chrysostom[1] takes notice, that God was also called the Father of the Israelites, and they his <i>children,</i> in the Old Testament, when God rather governed his people by fear of punishments, and promises of temporal blessings, but not in that particular manner as in the new law. (Witham) --- <i>The Spirit himself,</i> &c. By the inward motions of divine love, and the peace of conscience, which the children of God experience, they have a kind of testimony of God's favour; by which they are much strengthened in the hope of their justification and salvation; but yet not so as to pretend to an absolute assurance, which is not usually granted in this mortal life: during which we are taught to <i>work out our salvation with fear and trembling.</i> (Philippians ii. 12.) And <i>that he who thinketh himself to stand, must take heed lest he fall.</i> (1 Corinthians x. 12.) See also Romans xi. 20, 21, 22. (Challoner) --- <i>He hath given to us,</i> says St. John, (chap. i. 12.) <i>the power,</i> or dignity, <i>of being the sons of God.</i> Christ taught us to pray, and to begin our prayers with <i>our Father,</i> &c. (Matthew vi. 9.) (Witham)"
      v:019:
        - 'ROM:8:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>The expectation</i>[2] <i>of the creature.</i> He speaks of the corporal creation, made for the use and service of man; and, by occasion of his sin made subject to vanity, that is, to a perpetual instability, tending to corruption and other defects; so that by a figure of speech, it is here said to groan and be in labour, and to long for its deliverance, which is then to come, when sin shall reign no more; and God shall raise the bodies, and united them to their souls, never more to separate, and to be in everlasting happiness in heaven. (Challoner) --- <i>Waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God.</i> That is, for the time after this life, when it shall be made manifest that they are the sons of God, and heirs of the kingdom of his glory. Several interpreters understand all creatures whatsoever, even irrational and inanimate creatures of this world, which are represented as if they had a knowledge and sense of a more happy condition, of a new unchangeable state of perfection, which they are to receive at the end of the world. See 2 Peter i. 13; Apocalypse xxi. 1. Now every insensible creature is figuratively brought in <i>groaning</i> like a woman in labour, <i>waiting,</i> and wishing for that new and happy state; but in the mean time <i>unwillingly made subject to vanity,</i> i.e. to these changeable imperfections of generations and corruptions, which then they shall be <i>delivered from.</i> (Witham) --- <i>The creature,</i> &c. The creatures expect with impatience, and hope with confidence, to see a happy change in their condition; they flatter themselves that they will be delivered from the captivity of sin, to which man has reduced them, and enter into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God. Not that the inanimate creation will really participate the happiness and glory of the elect; although in some sense they may be said to have part in it, since they will enter into a pure, incorruptible and perfect state to the end of ages. They will no longer be subject to those changes and vicissitudes which sin has brought upon them; nor will sinful man any longer abuse their beauty and goodness in offending the Creator of all. St. Ambrose and St. Jerome teach that the sun, moon, and stars will be then much more brilliant and beautiful than at present, no longer subject to those changes they at present suffer. Philo and Tertullian teach that the beasts of prey will then lay aside their ferocity, and venomous serpents their poisonous qualities. (Calmet) --- Other, by the <i>creature</i> or creatures, understand men only, and Christians, who groan under miseries and temptations in this mortal life, amidst the <i>vanities</i> of this world, under the <i>slavery of corruption;</i> who having already (ver. 23.) received <i>the first-fruits of the Spirit,</i>[3] the grace of God in baptism, have been made <i>the children of God,</i> and now, with <i>expectation</i> and great <i>earnestness,</i> wait and long for a more perfect <i>adoption</i> of the sons of God: for the <i>redemption of their bodies,</i> when the bodies, as well as the souls of the elect, shall rise to an immortal life, and complete happiness in heaven. (Witham){JOIN}<b>Ver. 24, &c.</b> <i>For we are saved by hope,</i> as it is the will of God we should be, waiting and hoping with <i>patience</i> for the things which we have <i>not seen, which neither the eye hath seen, nor the ear hath heard,</i> &c. (1 Corinthians ii. 9.) --- <i>And the spirit also helpeth our infirmity...asketh for us with unspeakable groanings.</i>[4] If we understand this according to the common exposition, of the divine spirit of the Holy Ghost, the sense is, says St. Augustine, that the Holy Ghost <i>maketh us ask:</i> but we may understand the spirit of God and his grace, <i>diffused in our souls,</i> and in particular that gift of the Holy Ghost, called the <i>spirit of prayer,</i> given to the new Christians, which taught them what to ask, and how to pray.

This foreknowledge of God, according to St. Augustine,[6] is not merely a foreseeing of what men will do by the assistance and graces of God's ordinary providence, much less a foreseeing of what they will do by their own natural strength, as the Pelagian heretics pretended: but is a foreknowledge including an act of the divine will, and of his love towards his elect servants; (as to <i>know</i> in the Scriptures, when applied to God, is many times the same as to approve and love) God therefore hath foreseen or predestinated, or decreed that these elect, by the help of his special graces, and by the co-operation of their free-will, should be <i>conformable to the image of his Son,</i> that so his Son, even as man, might be the <i>first-born,</i> the chief, and the head of all that shall be saved. (Witham) --- God hath preordained that all his elect shall be conformable to the image of his Son. We must not here offer to dive into the secrets of God's eternal election: only firmly believe that all our <i>good,</i> in time and eternity, flows <i>originally</i> from God's free goodness; and all our <i>evil</i> from man's free will.

Christ is truly said to pray for us in heaven, though it is not he custom of the Church to call upon him in this manner, "Christ pray for us;" because being God, as well as man, he has all things under his command.

    commentary:
      v:003:
        - "ROM:9:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ.</i>[1] The word <i>anathema,</i> according to its derivation, signifies a thing separated or laid apart for some particular use. Hence it was put to signify things given and consecrated to God, which therefore used to be presented and hung up in temples. 2. The word also was applied to signify things whose destruction was resolved upon, that is, men or things separated for destruction, as sometimes, men deputed to be sacrificed to the gods to appease their anger. This signification was according to the Hebrew word <i>cherem,</i> and the Syriac word <i>horma,</i> as Numbers xxi. 3. He called the name of that place <i>Horma,</i> that is, <i>anathema;</i> because it was to be entirely destroyed. See 1 Machabees v. Hence <i>anathema</i> was also used for a <i>curse,</i> and to <i>anathematize,</i> to curse. See Acts xxiii. 14. The sense of this place is differently expounded. Tolet, by the word <i>I wished,</i> or <i>I did wish,</i> thinks that St. Paul might speak of the time before his conversion, when out of a false zeal, he wished to be separated from Christ, and from all Christians: and that he brings this to shew his brethren how zealous he had been for their religion. But this wish of St. Paul is generally expounded as proceeding from the great love and charity he had, when he was an apostle, for the conversion and salvation of his brethren, the Jews, who mostly remained obstinate and incredulous: and some will have it to be no more than a hyperbolical expression of his great love and affection for them. Others, with St. Jerome, ep. ad Algasiam, tom. iv. p. 203. Ed. Ben. think that by this way of speaking, St. Paul signifies himself willing to be sacrificed, by undergoing any death for their conversion: but St. Chrysostom (hom. xvi.) thinks this far short of the sublime charity of St. Paul; for by such a death, says he, he would not be separated <i>from</i> Christ, but would be a great gainer by it; since by that means he would soon be free from all the troubles and sufferings of a miserable life, and blessed with the company and enjoyment of Christ in the kingdom of his glory. He, and many others, think that St. Paul was so troubled and grieved to the heart at the obstinacy of the unbelieving Jews, at their blasphemies against Christ, and their eternal perdition, that an extraordinary charity and zeal for God's honour, and their salvation, made him wish even to endure a separation from Christ, and from the glory prepared for him in heaven, though not from the love, or from the grace of Christ. If this, says St. Chrysostom, seems incredible to us, it is because we are far from such heroic dispositions of the love of God, and of our neighbours. (Witham) --- The apostle's concern and love for his countrymen, the Jews, was so great, that he was willing even to suffer an <i>anathema,</i> or curse, for their sake; or any evil that could come upon him, without his offending God. (Challoner)"
      v:004:
        - 'ROM:9:4 | 4 | 4-5 | <i>To whom belongeth the adoption of children.</i> Literally, <i>whose is the adoption.</i> He mentions the favours which God had done to his people, the Jews. As, 1. That God had adopted them for his elect people. 2. That he had glorified them with so many miracles. 3. That he had made a particular <i>covenant</i> and alliance with them. 4. Given them a written law. 5. Prescribed the manner they should worship him. 6. <i>Promises</i> of divers blessings. 7. <i>Who are from the Fathers.</i> Literally, <i>whose are the Fathers;</i> i.e. who descended from the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, &c. 8. Of whose race, i.e. of the family of David, Jesus Christ, as man, was born. --- <i>Who is over all things God,</i>[2] <i>blessed for ever. Amen.</i> Though the apostles did not often, in express words, call Jesus Christ <i>the God,</i> lest the heathens, when they were not sufficiently instructed, should imagine that there were many gods, (as divers of the fathers take notice) yet here, and in several places, they clearly delivered the divinity of our Saviour, Christ. The Socinians might here observe, that the apostle calls him the God blessed for ever, and with the Greek article. (Witham)'
      v:006:
        - "ROM:9:6 | 6 | 6-7 | <i>Not as though the word of God hath failed</i> in his promises made to Abraham, and the patriarchs. The Jews pretended that the promises were made to them only, and to those that were of their race, and that the Gentiles were not to partake of them. St. Paul shews them their mistake, by telling them who are to be esteemed the true children of Abraham, and of the patriarchs, according to the promises which God made, and who are not. (Witham) --- <i>All are not Israelites,</i> &c. Not all, who are the carnal seed of <i>Israel,</i> are true <i>Israelites</i> in God's account: who, as by his free grace he heretofore preferred Isaac before Ismael, and Jacob before Esau, so he could, and did by the like free grace, election, and mercy, raise up spiritual children by faith to Abraham and Israel, from among the Gentiles, and prefer them before the carnal Jews. (Challoner) --- <i>Neither are all they, who are of the seed of Abraham,</i> his true spiritual children, to whom these promises were made: <i>nor are</i> all they who are descended from Isaac the children of these promises nor are <i>all they</i> true <i>Israelites,</i> to whom these blessings were promised, although they are descended <i>from Israel;</i> but only they who are the children of the patriarchs by faith in Jesus, the Messias, in whom God promised that he would bless all nations. (Witham)"
      v:009:
        - "ROM:9:9 | 9 | 9 | To prove that the children of Abraham are the children of the promise, he adduces the passage of Scripture: \"I will come in a year's time, and Sara shall have a son.\" (Genesis xviii.) This promised child was Isaac, the true son of the promise of God, and of the faith of Abraham; and not the son of the flesh, for Ismael was this as well as Isaac; but he was granted to the prayers of Abraham, a child of the grace and mercy of God. All the faithful, therefore, of whatever race or nation they may be, are in this sense the children of Abraham, by being gratuitously chosen by God, and by the fidelity in which they are imitators of Abraham. (Calmet){JOIN}<b>Ver. 10. &c.</b> <i>And not only she</i> (Sara) brought forth Isaac, who was the only child of Abraham, to whom the promises descended, though he was the father of Ismael, by Agar, and of all the Ismaelites. And lest the Jews should say that the Ismaelites, though descending from Abraham, according to the flesh, were not to be reputed as his children for another reason, because they came of Agar, who was only the handmaid of Sara; he brings them another example to which they could make no such reply; to wit, that <i>Rebecca</i> also at once had two sons of Isaac, <i>Esau</i> and <i>Jacob;</i> where, though Esau was the first-born, these promises were not reputed as made to him, and his descendants, the Idumeans, who were equally the descendants of Isaac, yet not the favourite people, nor the children of God, as the Jews saw very well. (Witham) --- <i>Not yet born.</i> By this example of these twins, and the preference of the younger to the elder, the drift of the apostle is, to shew that God, in his election, mercy, and grace, is not tied to any particular nation, as the Jews imagined, nor to any prerogative of birth, or any foregoing merits. For as, antecedently, to his grace, he sees no merit in any, but finds all involved in sin, in the common mass of condemnation; and all children of wrath; there is no one whom he might not justly leave in that mass; so that whomsoever he delivers from it, he delivers in his mercy: and whomsoever he leaves in it, he leaves in his justice. As when, of two equally criminal, the king is pleased out of pure mercy to pardon one, whilst he suffers justice to take place in the execution of the other. (Challoner) --- <i>Nor had done any good or evil.</i> God was pleased to prefer, and promise his blessings to the younger of them, Jacob, declaring <em>that the elder shall serve the younger;</em> that is, that the seed of the elder should be subject to that of the younger, as it happened afterwards to the Idumeans. And the prophet, Malachias, said of them, <i>I have loved Jacob, but hated Esau, and turned his mountains into a desert,</i> &c. --- <i>That the purpose of God,</i> his will, and his decree, (see the foregoing chap. ver. 28.) <i>might stand according to election,</i> might be, not according to any works they had done, or that he foresaw they would do, but merely according to his mercy. And though the preference which God gave to Jacob was literally true, as to temporal benefits; yet St. Augustine observes in divers places, that Jacob was a figure of the elect or predestinate, and Esau of the reprobate; and that as Jacob and his posterity was more favoured, purely by the mercy of God, without any merits on their side; so are God's elect, whom he has called, and to whom, according to his eternal purpose, he decreed to give eternal glory, and special graces to bring them thither. (Witham)"
      v:014:
        - "ROM:9:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>What shall we say, then? Is there injustice with God,</i> when he bestows special favours and benefits on some, and not on others? He answers, <i>by no means.</i> And he justifies almighty God's conduct, ver. 22. In the mean time, it is certain that there is no injustice in not giving what another has no right to: and besides all men having sinned, deserved punishment. If then, he shews mercy to some, it is an effect of his goodness and liberality only which they do not deserve. If he leaves others in their sins, they are only punished according to their deserts. His mercy shines upon his elect; and his divine justice is displayed against the wicked and the reprobate, but only according to what they have deserved. (Witham)"
      v:015:
        - "ROM:9:15 | 15 | 15-16 | <i>I will have mercy,</i> &c. <i>Then it is not of him that willeth,</i> &c. By these words he again teaches that God's call and predestination of those whom he has decreed to save, is not upon account of any works or merits in men, but only to be attributed to the mercy and goodness of God. See St. Thomas Aquinas on this chap. lect. iii. See St. Augustine, Encher. chap. xcviii. Epis. 194. in the new Ed. Ep. 105. ad Sixtum de lib. Arbit. chap. xxv. &c. (Witham)"
      v:017:
        - 'ROM:9:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>For the Scripture saith to Pharao,</i> &c. St. Paul had shewn that there was no injustice in God by his giving special graces to the elect; now he shews that God cannot be accounted unjust for leaving the reprobate in their sins, or for punishing them as they deserve; for this purpose he brings the example of Pharao, who remained hardened against all the admonitions and chastisements of him and his kingdom. --- <i>Have I raised thee up,</i> placed thee king over Egypt; I have done so many miracles before thee, I have spared thee when thou deservedst to be punished with death, and at last shall punish thee with thy army in the Red Sea, that my name may be known over all the earth. (Witham)'
      v:018:
        - "ROM:9:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>And whom he will, he hardeneth.</i>[3] That is, permits to be hardened by their own malice, as it is divers times said in Exodus, that Pharao hardened his heart. God, says St. Augustine, is said to harden men's hearts, not by causing their malice, but by not giving them the free gift of his grace, by which they become hardened by their own perverse will. (Witham) --- Not by being the cause, or author of his sin, but by withholding his grace, and so leaving him in his sin, in punishment of his past demerits. (Challoner){JOIN}<b>Ver. 19. &c.</b> <i>Thou wilt say, therefore, to me,</i> &c. The apostle makes objection, that if God call some, and harden, or even permit others to be hardened, and no one <i>resisteth,</i> or can hinder <i>his</i> absolute <i>will, why</i> should God <i>complain</i> that men are not converted? St. Paul first puts such rash and profane men in mind, that is unreasonable and impertinent for creatures to murmur and dispute against God their Creator, when they do not comprehend the ways of his providence. --- <i>O man,</i> [4] <i>who art thou that repliest against God?</i> This might stop the mouths, and quiet the minds of every man, when he cannot comprehend the mysteries of predestination, of God's foreknowledge, his decrees and graces, or the manner of reconciling them with human liberty. He may cry out with St. Paul again, (chap. xi. 33.) <i>O the riches of the wisdom, and of the knowledge of God! how incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his ways!</i> --- <i>Shall the thing formed,</i> &c. <i>Hath not the potter power,</i> &c.[5] To teach men that they ought not to complain against God and his providence, when they cannot comprehend his works, he puts them in mind of their origin. Every one may say to God, with the prophet Isaias, (vi. 48.) <i>Lord, thou art our Father, and we are but clay; thou art our Maker who framed us, and we are all of us the work of thy hands.</i> Hath not the potter power as he pleaseth, out of the same lump of clay to make some vessels for honourable uses, and some for less honourable. St. Chrysostom observes very well, that this comparison must not be extended further than the apostle designed; which was to teach us, how submissive we ought to be to God, in what we do not understand; but we must not pretend from hence, nor from any expression in this chapter, as divers heretics have done, that as vessels of clay are destitute of free will and liberty, so are men. This is against the doctrine of the Catholic Church, and against the Scriptures, in many places. (Witham) --- <i>The potter.</i> This similitude is used, only to shew that we are not to dispute with our Maker: nor to reason with him why he does not give as much grace to one as to another: for since the whole lump of our clay is vitiated by sin, it is owing to his goodness and mercy that he makes out of it so many vessels of honour; and it is no more than just that others, in punishment of their unrepented sins, should be given up to be vessels of dishonour. (Challoner)"
      v:022:
        - 'ROM:9:22 | 22 | 22-23 | <i>And if God,</i> &c. He now gives the reason why God might, without any injustice, have mercy on some, and not on others; grant particular graces and favours to his elect, and not equally to all; because all mankind was become liable to damnation by original sin: the clay that all are made of, is a sinful clay; and as St. Augustine says, was become a lump and mass of damnation. Every one had sinned in Adam. Now, if out of this sinful lump and multitude God, to <i>shew the richness of his glory,</i> and superabundant mercy, hath chosen some as vessels of election, whom he hath decreed to save, and by special graces and favours to make partakers of his heavenly kingdom; and to shew <i>his justice</i> and hatred of sin, hath left others <i>as vessels of his wrath</i> and justice, to be lost in their sins, which for a time <i>he bears patiently with,</i> when they deserved present punishment, who can say that he hath done unjustly? (Witham){JOIN}<b>Ver. 24. &c.</b> <i>Whom also he hath called,</i> &c. That is, he hath called some <i>of the Jews,</i> and many <i>of the Gentiles,</i> to be vessels of election, as he foretold by his prophet Osee, (ii. 24.) <i>I will call them my people, that were not my people,...</i>and I will make them <i>the children of the living God.</i> And as it was also foretold by <i>the</i> prophet Isaias, of all the numerous nation of the Jews, only <i>a remnant shall be saved,</i> by their obstinacy in not receiving, and refusing to believe in, their Messias. For <i>finishing his word, and reducing it by his justice to a little, because the Lord will bring to pass his word reducing it to a small compass upon the earth.</i> The sense and construction of this verse is equally obscure in the Greek and in the Latin text: the true sense seems to be, that <i>finishing his word,</i> or fulfilling his promises to Israel, those that are to be saved, will be <i>reduced</i> by his justice for their sins, to <i>a few;</i> because, though <i>he bring to pass his word,</i> and his promises, the saved among the Israelites will be reduced to a small compass, in comparison of the great number of the Gentiles. This exposition agrees with the rest of the text, and with what follows, and was foretold <i>by Isaias,</i> (chap. i. 9.) that <i>unless the God of Sabaoth</i> (of hosts) had, through his mercy, <i>left</i> them <i>a seed,</i> a small number, they would all in a manner have deserved to be utterly destroyed, like Sodom and Gomorrha. (Witham) --- What I say, shall come to pass, that in those places, viz. Greece, Italy, &c. where those who are strangers to the worship of the true God dwell, and have been called, on account of their profane worship, <i>not my people.</i> In those very places, they shall receive the true worship of God, and by this means shall become and be called <i>the children of the living God.</i> He is so particular as to place, lest the Jews should imagine that the Gentiles would be converted like their former proselytes, and either dwell in Judea, or repair to it at certain stated times. Thus the apostle repeats what Jesus Christ had before said to the Samaritan woman. <i>The hour will come when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall you adore the Father.</i> (Estius) (John iv.) --- <i>A remnant.</i> That is, a small number only of the <i>children of Israel</i> shall be converted and saved. How perversely is this text quoted for the salvation of men of all religions, when it speaks only of the converts of the children of Israel. (Challoner) --- St. Paul is here speaking of the reprobation of the Jews, and of the vocation of the Gentiles, and foretells that a remnant, or small number of the children of Israel shall be converted, and saved. In the sense of St. Paul, we sincerely hope, and confidently trust, that a remnant of all will be saved through a timely conversion. But we no where read, in the <i>Old,</i> or <i>New</i> Scriptures, that <i>a remnant of all will be saved,</i> as if it were a matter of indifference to what society or connexion a Christian was joined. (Haydock)'
      v:030:
        - 'ROM:9:30 | 30 | 30-32 | <i>What then shall we say?</i> Or what shall we conclude from these testimonies of the Scripture, but this paradox, as St. Chrysostom calls it, that they who sought for justice, or sanctification, found it not, and they who did not seek it, found it; that is, the Jews, who sought for this justice by the works of their law, which they magnified so much, have not attained to that <i>law</i> that could make them just; whereas the Gentiles, who had no such written law to confide in, have only sought to be justified by the <i>faith</i> and law of Christ, by which they have met with justice, and sanctification? (Witham) --- Behold what was wanting to the justice of the Jews! Scrupulous observers of the ceremonial law: esteeming too much their power, and pretended justice, they regarded the gospel and faith in Christ as of no advantage. Running in the path of the commandments with zeal, but without circumspection, they struck against Jesus Christ, who became to them a stumbling-block. They rejected him: they refused to believe. Thus did their works become dead works, without any fruit for eternity. (Calmet)'
      v:033:
        - 'ROM:9:33 | 33 | 33 | Why then have not the Jews been justified? <i>because they stumbled at the stumbling-stone:</i> that is, the doctrine of Christ crucified has been a scandal to the Jews, at which being offended, they would not own him for their Messias. Yet <i>whosoever believeth in him,</i> and follows his law and doctrine, <i>shall not be confounded,</i> but obtain justification and salvation. (Witham)'

Thus, though tenderly affected towards his countrymen, still he could not dissemble the truth, or flatter them in their incredulity, and hardness of heart. (Calmet)'

      v:009:
        - 'ROM:10:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Thou shalt be saved.</i> To confess the Lord Jesus, and to call upon the name of the Lord, (ver. 13.) is not barely the professing of a belief in the person of Christ: but moreover implies a belief of his whole doctrine, and an obedience to his law; without which the calling of him Lord will save no man. (St. Matthew vii. 21.) (Challoner) --- This passage must be understood like many others of this apostle, of a faith accompanied by a good-will ready to perform what faith says must be practised; as it is required in this very place, that what we believe in the heart, we should confess with our mouth.

The common interpretation is, who hath believed what he hath heard from us? (Witham)'

The one is extraordinary by internal inspiration, as was that of John the Baptist, and all the other prophets; in which case, however, extraordinary proofs must be given that they are sent by God; and the other is ordinary, which is derived from Christ, and from the apostles and their successors, whom he has appointed to be his vicegerents on earth. (Estius)'
      v:018:
        - 'ROM:10:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>But I say, have they not heard?</i> He puts an objection, and by his answer shews the Jews are inexcusable in not believing, since the gospel has been preached all the world over, and in places where the Jews were, as it was foretold: and also because the Gentiles every where have believed; which even excites you Jews to jealousy against them, as Moses foretold: (Deuteronomy xxxii. 21.) that is, when you now see, that the Gentiles, whom you despised so much, by believing in Christ, have received the gifts of the Holy Ghost, of working miracles, of speaking tongues, of prophecy, &c. (Witham)'
      v:019:
        - 'ROM:10:19 | 19 | 19 | A people whom you have always despised, as not being worthy to be numbered amongst mankind, I will make my beloved people. I will enrich with my graces those whom you have contemned; I will give them the grace of adoption, thus to stir you up to jealousy and rage. And in effect, what greater rage ever was there, than that of the Jews against the converted Gentiles? In persecution, the Jews were always most busy. Thus were the Jews plainly informed of the truth of the gospel, by the Gentiles converted before their face. (Calmet)'

        - 'ROM:10:21 | 21 | 21 | After the preaching of Christ, and his apostles, after so many wonders wrought by our Saviour, he at last offers himself to the Jewish people, with stretched-out hands, and yet they cannot be induced to believe in him. They resist him as much as they can, thus verifying the prophecy of holy Simeon, that he should be set up as a sign to be contradicted. (Luke ii.) (Estius)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "ROM:11:1 | 1 | 1, &c | St. Paul in this chapter endeavours to comfort the Jews, though the greatest part of them were rejected for their blindness; and to admonish the Gentiles, not to boast for being called and converted, but to persevere with humility, and the fear of God. --- <i>God hath not cast away his people.</i> That is, not all of them, nor hath he cast off those whom <i>he foreknew,</i> and decreed to save. --- <i>The Scripture saith of Elias.</i> He brings the example of Elias living among the ten tribes of Israel, when all the people were forbidden to go and adore in the temple of Jerusalem, when the altars of the true God were destroyed, and almost all in these tribes were fallen into idolatry, and worshipped <i>Baal:</i> he complains as if he were left alone in the worship of the true God. But <i>the divine answer</i> shewed him his mistake. <i>I have reserved to myself seven thousand man,</i> &c. Some take notice that <i>seven</i> is divers times put for a great number, as three and a half for a small number: however, besides these seven thousand, all in the kingdom of Juda remained firm in the worship of the true God. In like manner, <i>a remnant</i> is now saved by the election of grace, by God's free and liberal gift of divine grace. Some pretended reformers of the faith of the Church bring this as an argument, that the Church of God may fail, and fall into errors. It is sufficient to answer, that there is a wide difference betwixt the Jewish synagogue, which brought nothing to perfection, and the Church of Christ, which he <i>built upon a rock,</i> with which he has promised to <i>be to the end of the world,</i> and <i>guide</i> them by the <i>Spirit of Truth.</i> (Witham) --- This is very ill alleged by some against the perpetual visibility of the Church of Christ: the more, because however the number of the faithful might be abridged by the persecution of Jezebel in the kingdom of the ten tribes; the Church was at the same time in a most flourishing condition (under Asa and Josaphat) in the kingdom of Juda. (Challoner) --- Our separated brethren add to this text, as in Acts xix. 35. the word <i>image.</i> They also cite it in proof of an invisible Church; but with no just grounds: for in Jerusalem the faith and worship were public to the whole world. Besides, the Christian Church rests on better promises than the synagogue. (Bristow) --- The Jews obtain not the justice they sought after, because they did not seek it as they ought; they expected to obtain it by their works, whereas it can only be had from grace. (Estius)"
      v:006:
        - "ROM:11:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>It is not now by works: otherwise grace is no more grace.</i> The election of God, and the first grace at least, are always without any merits on our part; but if we speak of works done in a state of grace, and by the assistance of God's grace, we co-operate with the graces given, and by thus co-operating, we deserve and merit a reward in heaven. (Witham) --- If salvation were to come by <i>works,</i> done by nature, without faith and grace, salvation would not be a grace or favour, but a debt; but such <i>dead</i> works are indeed of no value in the sight of God towards salvation. It is not the same with regard to <i>works done with and by</i> God's grace; for to such works as these he has promised eternal salvation. (Challoner)"
      v:008:
        - "ROM:11:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>God hath given them,</i> &c. Not by his working, or acting in them; but by his permission, and by withdrawing his grace in punishment of their obstinacy. (Challoner) --- Permitted them (says St. Chrysostom) to fall <i>into the spirit of insensibility.</i> Literally, <i>the spirit of</i> [1] <i>compunction.</i> Compunction is not here taken, as in some spiritual writers, for a great sorrow for sins. In the Latin Vulgate (Isaias vi. 9.) it is called the <i>spirit of slumber,</i> as in the Protestant translation. We cannot have a better judge of the sense of the word than St. Chrysostom, who tells us, that it signifies <i>a habit of the soul,</i> firmly fixed in <i>evil,</i> and an insensible disposition: as, saith he, persons under a pious compunction are not to be removed from their good resolutions; so the wicked, under a hardened compunction, are nailed, as it were, to vice. And that here this is the true sense, appears by the following words out of Isaias: <i>he hath given them eyes that they should not see,</i> &c. And also out of David, (Psalm lxviii. 23.) <i>let their table be made a snare,</i> &c. We may understand the spiritual food of the word of God, and of the Scriptures; which by the blindness of this people, have served to their great condemnation. --- <i>And a recompense,</i> that is, for a just punishment of their obstinacy. --- <i>And bow down their back always,</i> a metaphor to represent the condition of such, as are under heavy oppressions. (Witham) --- Although by bending their back is literally understood the yoke of servitude and captivity, with which the Jews were oppressed at the destruction of Jerusalem; yet it seems more conformable to the apostle's meaning, when considered in a spiritual sense, and then it will signify the insensibility of the Jews, as to heavenly things, and their anxious solicitude for the things of the earth. This their avaricious and carnal disposition was so manifest, that the poet said of them---{JOIN}{BQ:2}O curvæ in terram animæ et cœlestium inanes.--- (Estius)"
      v:011:
        - 'ROM:11:11 | 11 | 11-15 | <i>Have they so stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid.</i> That is, their fall is not irreparable, or so as never to rise again: but by their offending, salvation (through the liberal mercy of God) is come to the Gentiles, <i>that they,</i> the Jews, may be <i>emulous</i> of the Gentiles, and of their happiness, and so may be converted. (Witham) --- The nation of the Jews is not absolutely and without remedy cast off for ever; but in part only (many thousands of them having been at first converted) and for a time: which fall of theirs God has been pleased to turn to the good of the Gentiles. (Challoner) --- <i>How much more the fulness of them?</i> As if he should say, if the obstinacy of so many Jews seem to be an occasion upon which God, whose mercy calls whom he pleaseth, hath bestowed the riches of his grace on other nations; and while the glory of the Jews, the elect people of God, has been <i>diminished,</i> the Gentiles have been made happy: how much more glorious <i>will be the fulness of them?</i> that is, according to the common interpretation, will be the re-establishment and conversion of the Jews hereafter, before the end of the world? See St. Chrysostom, {GREEK:START om. ith}ω. ιθ{GREEK:END}. p. 164; St. Hilary, in Ps. lviii; St. Jerome, in chap. iii. Osee. Habacuc iii.; St. Augustine, lib. xx. de Civ. Dei. chap. xxix. --- Then (ver. 15.) the <i>receiving</i> of them into the Church, and their conversion to Christ, shall be like <i>life from the dead,</i> when the Jewish nation in general, shall rise from the death of sin, and their hardened infidelity, to the life of faith and grace. These things I speak to you, Gentiles, to <i>honour</i> and comply with my <i>ministry</i> of being your apostle: yet endeavouring at the same time, if by a pious emulation, or by any other way, I may be able to bring any of my <i>flesh,</i> or of my brethren, the Jews, to be <i>saved</i> by the faith of Christ. (Witham){JOIN}<b>Ver. 16. &c.</b> <i>If the first-fruit</i> (see the Greek word) <i>be holy, so also is the mass;</i> so also the rest, the product that follows. He alludes to the offering made by the law of the first-fruit, which was to acknowledge that all good things were from God, and to bring a blessing upon the rest. --- <i>If the root be holy, so are the branches.</i> By the <i>root,</i> says St. Chrysostom, he understands Abraham, and the patriarchs, from whom all the Jewish nation proceeded, as branches from that root: and these <i>branches</i> are to be esteemed <i>holy,</i> not only because of the root they proceeded from, but also because they worshipped the true God. And if <i>some,</i> or a great part <i>of these branches,</i> have been <i>broken,</i> they may, as it is said, (ver. 23.) be ingrafted again. And you, Gentiles, ought to remember that, you were of yourselves <i>a wild olive-tree:</i> and it is only by the merciful call of God, that you have the happiness to <i>be ingrafted</i> upon the same root of the patriarchs; and so, by imitating the faith of Abraham, are become his spiritual children, and heirs of the promises, and by that means have been made partakers of <i>the root,</i> and of the sap, and <i>fatness</i> of the sweet <i>olive-tree.</i> Remember that you <i>bear not the root,</i> nor were you the root that was holy; <i>but the root beareth you;</i> and that being branches of a wild olive, you ought naturally still to bear bad fruit, though ingrafted on the root of a sweet olive. It is only by the mercies of God, if you bring forth good fruit. Do not then be <i>high-minded,</i> nor boast, but <i>fear,</i> and endeavour to <i>continue in goodness;</i> lest God also <i>spare not you,</i> but <i>cut you off,</i> as unprofitable branches. And let me tell you, as to the Jews, if <i>they abide not still in unbelief,</i> God is able to ingraft them again into their own olive-tree; and it seems more easy, that they, who are naturally branches of the sweet olive-tree, should bring forth good fruit, when they shall be ingrafted in their own olive-tree, being of the race of Abraham, to whom the promises were made. (Witham) --- We see here, that he who standeth by faith, may fall from it; and therefore must live in fear, and not in the vain presumption and security of modern sectaries. (Challoner) --- The apostle here exhorts the converted Gentiles, to fear lest they fall, and bring upon themselves a punishment similar to that of the Jews. The Jews were his chosen people, the children of the alliance; they have now been stripped of all; the same may also happen to you. You may fall into presumption and incredulity; if you remain firm, it is not by your own merits or works, but by faith, the pure gift of God. Neither faith, nor vocation, nor grace, are inadmissible. You may lose all; and therefore ought always to fear and live in humility. If God has not spared the natural branches, fear, lest he should not spare you. (ver. 21.) (Calmet) --- The Gentiles are here admonished not to be proud, nor to glory over the Jews; but to take occasion rather from their fall to fear and to be humble, lest they be cast off. Not that the whole Church of Christ can ever fall from him; having been secured by so many divine promises in holy writ; but that each one in particular may fall; and therefore all in general are to be admonished to beware of that, which may happen to any one in particular. (Challoner)'

(Witham){JOIN}<b>Ver. 30. &c.</b> <i>As you also in times past did not believe God, but now have obtained mercy through their unbelief,</i> which was an occasion of God's sending his preachers to you: but the cause of your salvation is God's mercy. --- <i>That they also may obtain mercy.</i> That is, God has permitted their incredulity, that being a greater object of pity, he may shew greater mercy in converting them by the free gift of his grace. --- <i>For God hath concluded</i> [2] <i>all,</i> that is, has permitted at different times, both Gentiles and Jews, to fall into a state of unbelief, that the salvation of all may be known to come, not from themselves, but as an effect of his mercy and grace. (Witham) --- He hath found all nations, both Jews and Gentiles, in unbelief and sin; not by his causing, but by the abuse of their own free-will; so that their calling and election are purely owing to his mercy. (Challoner)"

After he hath spoken of the mysteries of God's grace and predestination, of his mercy and justice, which we must not pretend to dive into, he concludes this part of his epistle, by an exclamation, to teach us submission of our judgment, as to the secrets of his providence, which we cannot comprehend. --- <i>How incomprehensible are his judgments,</i> &c. --- <i>Who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be made him?</i> That is, no one, by any merit on his part, can first deserve God's favours and mercy, by which he prevents us. --- <i>For of him,</i> from God, or from Jesus Christ, as God, and <i>by him,</i> who made, preserves, and governs all things, and <i>in him,</i> is our continual dependance: for in him we live, we move, and exist. In the Greek, it is <i>unto him,</i>[3] to signify he is also our last end. See the notes, John chap. i. (Witham) --- All things are from God, as their first cause and creator; all things are by God, as the ruler and governor of the universe; and all things are in God, or (as the Greek has it) for God, because they are all directed to his honour and glory. For he hath made all things for himself. (Psalm xvi; St. Basil, lib. de Spiritu sto. chap. 5.)"

        - 'ROM:12:1 | 1 | 1 | With this chapter St. Paul begins his second part, in which he gives us most excellent lessons of morality, after which every Christian should aim to form his life, and thus resemble Jesus Christ and his saints. (Haydock) --- <i>That you present your bodies a living sacrifice.</i> And how must this be done? says St. Chrysostom, hom. xx. Let the eye abstain from sinful looks and glances, and it is a sacrifice; the tongue from speaking ill, and it is a sacrifice, &c. --- <i>Your reasonable service,</i> or worship,[1] <i>from you;</i> nothing being more reasonable, than for men to serve God with their souls and bodies, &c. (Witham)'
      v:002:
        - 'ROM:12:2 | 2 | 2 | Take care, lest you imitate the practices of worldlings. Let your heart, your ambition, carry you to heaven: ever despise those things which the world admires, that every one may see by your actions that you are not of the society of worldlings, and have neither regard nor friendship for them. (Calmet) --- Transform yourselves into new men, by the renewal of your mind, that you may discern on all occasions, what is most perfect, most pleasing and acceptable to God. (Bible de Vence)'
      v:003:
        - 'ROM:12:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>To be wise unto sobriety.</i> Not pretending to be more wise, or more knowing than you are. --- <i>As God hath divided to every one the measure of faith.</i> The sense by what follows is, that every one make the best use, for the glory of God, and the good of his neighbour, of the gifts and graces which he hath received together with the faith of Christ; i.e. <i>of prophecy,</i> or the gift of interpreting past prophecies, or of foretelling things to come, <i>of exhorting,</i> of <i>ministering</i> as to those functions which belong to the ministers of the gospel, &c. (Witham)'
      v:009:
        - 'ROM:12:9 | 9 | 9 | The apostle does not here prohibit that defence, by which a person, either by word or action, preserves himself from injury. This he could not condemn, since he had so often recourse to it himself, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles: and in the second [epistle] to Timothy, he writes: "In my first defence no one was with me." Be he only forbids that revenge which a person takes of his neighbour, by private means, without having recourse to legal authority. (Estius)'
      v:013:
        - 'ROM:12:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Communicating</i> [2] <i>to the necessities of the saints.</i> Making them partakers of what you have, by relieving them. (Witham)'
      v:016:
        - 'ROM:12:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Condescending to the humble,</i> in the spirit of charity and sweetness. See Luke ii. 48. (Witham)'
      v:018:
        - 'ROM:12:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>If it be possible,....have peace with all.</i> That is, if it can be without prejudice to truth or justice, &c. And even when others wrong you, seek not to revenge yourselves, but leave your cause to God. Do good offices even to those that do evil to you. (Witham)'
      v:019:
        - 'ROM:12:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Give place to wrath.</i> That we do, says St. Chrysostom, when we leave all to God, and endeavour to return good for evil. (Witham)'
      v:020:
        - 'ROM:12:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</i> This figurative way of speaking is differently expounded. Some say, inasmuch as by this means thou shalt make him liable to greater punishments from God. Others, as St. Jerome and St. Augustine, by <i>coals of fire,</i> understand kindnesses and benefits, which shall touch the heart, and inflame the affections even of thy enemies, which shall make them sorry for what they have done, and become thy friends. (Witham)'
      v:021:
        - "ROM:12:21 | 21 | 21 | This is the apostle's conclusion of the foregoing instructions. Be not overcome by the malice of thy enemy, so as to wish to revenge thyself, without leaving all to the just judgment of God; but overcome his malice by thy kindness. This is complied with, when upon occasion of injuries received we always make a return of kindness, and in proportion as the malice of our enemies increases, our spirit of benevolence should also increase. (Estius)"

      v:001:
        - 'ROM:13:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Let every soul,</i> or every one, <i>be subject,</i> &c.[1] The Jews were apt to think themselves not subject to temporal princes, as to taxes, &c. and lest Christians should misconstrue their Christian liberty, he here teacheth them that every one (even priests and bishops, says St. Chrysostom) must be subject and obedient to princes, even to heathens, as they were at that time, as to laws that regard the policy of the civil government, honouring them, obeying them, and their laws, as it is the will of God, because the power they act by is from God. So that <em>to resist them,</em> is <em>to resist God.</em> And every Christian must obey them even for conscience-sake. St. Chrysostom takes notice that St. Paul does not say that there is no prince but from God, but only that there is no power but from God, meaning no lawful power, and speaking of true and just laws. See hom. xxiii. (Witham)'
      v:008:
        - "ROM:13:8 | 8 | 8-9 | <i>But that you love one another.</i> This is a debt, says St. Chrysostom, which we are always to be paying, and yet always remains, and is to be paid again. --- <i>He that loveth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the law.</i> Nay, he that loves his neighbour, as he ought, loves him for God's sake, and so complies with the other great precept of loving God: and upon these two precepts (as Christ himself taught us, Matthew xxii. 40.) <i>depends the whole law and the prophets.</i> (Witham)"
      v:010:
        - 'ROM:13:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Love of the neighbour worketh no evil.</i>[2] This, by the Latin, is the true construction; and not, love worketh no evil to the neighbour, as it might be translated from the Greek. (Witham)'
      v:011:
        - 'ROM:13:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.</i> Some will have the sense to be, that our salvation is now nearer, when the gospel is preached, and Christ offers us his graces, than when we believed the Messias was to come. Others expound it, that the more of our life is spent, we come nearer to the judgment of God, and to the salvation promised in heaven. (Witham)'
      v:012:
        - 'ROM:13:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>The night is passed.</i> That is, the night of sin and infidelity, in which you lived, before you began to serve Christ. (Witham) --- St. Paul is here addressing himself to Gentile converts. Before your conversion, you were in the darkness of infidelity: this time is past; now is the day, when the gospel has dissipated the darkness of idolatry, ignorance, and sin. Let us lay aside the works of darkness, by flying from sin, which hates the light, and seeks always to conceal itself; and let us put on the armour of light, the shield of faith, the breast-plate of justice, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - 'ROM:13:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Let us walk honestly as in the day.</i> As men are accustomed to do in the light, without being afraid that their works come to light. --- <i>Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering,</i>[3] not in <i>beds and impurities,</i> not in immodest disorders. (Witham) --- The night of the present life full of darkness, of ignorance, and of sin, is already far advanced; and the day of eternity approaches: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness. (Bible de Vence)'
      v:014:
        - 'ROM:13:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.</i> To <i>put on,</i> is a metaphor used in the Scripture; as when it is said, <i>put on the new man,</i> &c. <i>And make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscenses.</i> That is, do not take care, nor pamper and indulge your appetite in eating and drinking, so as to increase your disorderly inclinations, but keep them in due subjection. (Witham) --- The apostle does not forbid all care of the body, since he himself says in the epistle to the Ephesians, v. "No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it." But he forbids that care of the flesh, by which the desires and concupiscences of the flesh are strengthened and encouraged. This those are guilty of, who are always indulging in delights and voluptuousness. (Estius) --- Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, enter into his sentiments, imitate his virtues, and indulge not the flesh in its inordinate desires.'

      v:001:
        - 'ROM:14:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Not in disputes about thoughts.</i>[1] That is, without blaming or condemning the thoughts, and reasonings (as it appears by the Greek) of those new converts, who had been Jews, and who were still of this opinion, that they ought to abstain from <i>meats</i> forbidden by the Jewish law, and observe the Jewish festival <em>days.</em> You must charitably bear with the weakness of such converts. (Witham) --- Be tender with him who is weak in faith; enter not into disputes with him, which only serve to extinguish charity, and create inveterate prejudices.'
      v:002:
        - "ROM:14:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Eat all things.</i> Viz. without observing the distinction between clean and unclean meats, prescribed by the law of Moses: which was now no longer obligatory. Some weak Christians, converted from among the Jews, as we here gather from the apostle, made a scruple of eating such meats as were deemed unclean by the law: such as swine's flesh, &c. which the stronger sort of Christians did eat without scruple. Now the apostle, to reconcile them together, exhorts the former not to judge or condemn the latter, using their Christian liberty; and the latter to take care not to despise, or scandalize their weaker brethren, either by bringing them to eat what in their conscience they think they should not: or by giving them such offence, as to endanger the driving them thereby from the Christian religion. (Challoner) --- <i>For one</i> that is not so weak, but well instructed, <i>believeth,</i> is persuaded, that <i>he may eat all things,</i> the distinction of <i>clean</i> and unclean meats being no longer obligatory under the new law of Christ. He that is weak, and not convinced of this Christian liberty, let him <i>eat herbs,</i> or such things as he esteems not forbidden. It is likely some of them abstained many times from all manner of flesh, lest they should meet with what had been offered to idols, or lest something forbidden by the law might be mixed. (Witham)"
      v:003:
        - 'ROM:14:3 | 3 | 3-4 | <i>God hath taken him to him,</i> that eats of any meats; he accounts him his servant, and will reward him as such. --- <i>God is able to make him stand,</i> and will justify him before his tribunal. (Witham)'
      v:005:
        - 'ROM:14:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Between day,</i> &c. Still observing the sabbaths and festivals of the law. (Challoner.) --- <i>And another judgeth every day.</i> That is, thinks every day to be taken away, that was to be kept, merely because ordered under the Jewish law. And now since both they who keep days, or do not keep them; and they who <i>eat,</i> or who <i>abstain,</i> do these things which a regard to God, and according to their conscience, let no one judge, or condemn the one party, nor the other; in these things, <i>let every man abound in his own sense.</i> It is without grounds that some would pretend from hence, that Christians cannot be bound to fast, or abstain from flesh on certain days. The apostle speaks only of the distinction of meats, called <i>clean</i> and <i>unclean,</i> and of <i>fasts</i> or <i>feasts</i> peculiar to the law of Moses. It does not follow from hence, that the Catholic Church hath not power to command days of fasting, and abstaining, for self-denial or humiliation. (Witham) --- The apostle here treats only of the subject in hand, viz. the Mosaic distinctions of clean and unclean meats: and in this he allows, for that present time, each one to follow his own private judgment. St. Chrysostom observes that St. Paul did not wish the weak to be left to their own judgment in this, as in a point of no consequence; but that they should wait for a time. The converts were not immediately prohibited their accustomed practices, but they were tolerated in them for a while, till fully instructed. This we see in many of the converts at Jerusalem, who were still observers of the Mosaic ordinances; this was tolerated, that the synagogue might be buried with honour. (Estius)'
      v:011:
        - 'ROM:14:11 | 11 | 11 | The apostle here gives a remarkable proof of the divinity of our Saviour. He could not possibly be more express. He had said in the preceding verse, that all men should appear before the tribunal of Christ; to prove this assertion, he adduces this testimony of the prophet Isaias: "As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bend before me, and every tongue shall confess to God." (Isaias chap. xlv.) Thus shall all acknowledge the power, the divinity, and sovereign dominion of Christ, by bending the knee; and by confessing to him, shall acknowledge him for the master and judge of all mankind. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'ROM:14:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Nothing is unclean of itself.</i> Because the law that made them unclean, is not now binding of itself, yet a man must not act against his conscience, neither must he, when he can avoid it, scandalize or offend the weak: nor cause divisions or dissensions. (Witham)'
      v:015:
        - 'ROM:14:15 | 15 | 15 | St. Paul repeats this, in almost the same words, in 1 Corinthians chap. viii. and plainly gives us to understand, that Christ died for the salvation of all men, by supposing a Christian brother, for whom Christ had died, in danger of perishing by the scandal given by another. This supposition could never have been made, if the death of Christ was only offered up for the elect: but we here learn from St. Paul, that they for whom Christ shed his blood and suffered the death of the cross, may perish eternally; and therefore all, even the greatest reprobates, may be saved, if they effectually desire it, by virtue of the death of our divine Redeemer.'

He brings the example of Christ, <i>who pleased not himself,</i> who submitted himself to the law of circumcision, when he was above the law, who bore with the weakness and sins of others, their reproaches, their blasphemies, which he could not but hate, but this to gain their souls.

      v:008:
        - 'ROM:15:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision,</i> who came both for the salvation of the Jews, and of the Gentiles, who preached and would have his gospel first preached to the Jews, <i>for the truth of God to confirm the promises made to the fathers,</i> that he, the Messias, should be sent for their salvation; but at the same time also for the salvation and conversion of the Gentiles, which he confirms by divers evident testimonies of the holy Scriptures. (Witham) --- He calls our Saviour the minister of circumcision, that is, of the Jews, because he appeared amongst them, dwelt amongst them, and himself preached amongst them. This was a privilege which the Gentiles did no enjoy, having never seen, nor heard Jesus Christ, since he confined his preaching to the strayed sheep of the house of Israel; and this, to accomplish the promises made to their fathers. (Calmet){JOIN}<b>Ver. 15. &c.</b> <i>I have written to you, brethren, more boldly,</i> &c. St. Chrysostom admires with what mildness he addresses himself to them, yet puts them in mind, that he is <i>the minister,</i> and the <i>apostle of the Gentiles,</i> in which he may have reason to glory, or <i>boast.</i> --- <i>Sanctifying the gospel of God,</i> preaching it in a holy manner, that the Gentiles may be sanctified by it. (Witham) --- To be the minister of Jesus Christ among the nations, exercising in their regard the rite of sacrifice, as we read in the Greek, {GREEK:START ierourgounta}ιηρουργουντα{GREEK:END}. --- <i>For I dare not,</i> I shall forbear to speak of any thing but my labours: I need not mention the power of <i>miracles</i> and <i>wonders,</i> which the <i>Holy Ghost</i> hath done by me in many places, from Jerusalem to Illyricum, in places where Christ had not been preached by others. And now having <i>no more place,</i> nor occasion to preach <i>in these countries,</i> when <i>I begin my journey to Spain,</i> &c. by which, it appears, he designed at least to go into Spain. (Witham)'
      v:020:
        - 'ROM:15:20 | 20 | 20 | St. Paul does not mean to say, that he never preached where the gospel had before been announced; this would not have been true, for he preached at Damascus, where there were already Christians, whom he formerly wished to take in chains to Jerusalem; and again in this epistle he announces the truths of the gospel to the Romans already converted by the preaching of St. Peter. But he means to say, that on these occasions he acts not as an apostle, whose office it is to preach to infidels; but as one that waters, confirms, comforts, as he says in the beginning of this epistle: and this he did as occasion offered, as the subsequent verses shew, where he tells us his design in calling on the Romans, in his journey to Spain. (Estius)'
      v:024:
        - 'ROM:15:24 | 24 | 24 | It is a matter of dispute, whether St. Paul ever executed this his design of visiting Spain. The proofs of the Spaniards, who consider it as certain, are by no means unanswerable. There remain no certain monuments of this journey of his. The proof taken from the words of St. Clement, who lived at Rome in the time of St. Paul, is not certain, since he only says, that St. Paul came to the very extremities of the west. It is a subject on which commentators appear pretty equally divided. (Calmet) --- There is an old tradition that St. Paul, in his journey to Spain, left three of his disciples in Gaul; Trophimus at Arles, Crescentius at Vienne, and Paul at Narbonne; but this very tradition is disputed. (Bible de Vence)'
      v:025:
        - 'ROM:15:25 | 25 | 25-28 | <i>But I shall go to Jerusalem,</i> &c. By this St. Paul is thought to have written this epistle at Corinth, where he was about to set forward for Jerusalem, with the charities collected in Achaia and Macedonia, for the poor Christians in Judea. This he calls to <i>minister</i> to the poor saints, or to be <i>serviceable</i> to them. And to exhort others to the like charitable contributions, he says, (ver. 27.) <i>they are their debtors;</i> that the converted Gentiles are debtors to the converts, who had been Jews, as having been made partakers of the promises, particularly made to the people of the Jews, and sharers of those spiritual blessings, which Christ promised to the Jews, but were also conferred upon the Gentiles. He looks upon it, therefore, reasonable, that they relieve the Jews in their temporal wants. The apostle says, he goes <i>to consign to them this fruit,</i> to deliver to them their contributions. (Witham)'
      v:029:
        - 'ROM:15:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>I know,</i> by the Spirit of God revealing it to me, that God will give <em>a blessing</em> to my labours, when I come to you. That I may <i>be delivered</i> from the <i>unbelievers in Judea, from the</i> unbelieving Jews, foreseeing the persecution he should there meet with. That I may <i>be refreshed</i> with you, have comfort by finding peace and union among you. (Witham)'
      v:032:
        - 'ROM:15:32 | 32 | 32 | The word in the original signifies to combat with another, to teach us, that to beg the prayers of our friends will be of little assistance to us, if we do not join our prayer also, and labour, on our part, to the best of our power. (Calmet)'

  - PREFACE.
  - "After the <i>Gospels,</i> which contain the history of Christ, and the <i>Acts of the Apostles,</i> which contain the history of the infant Church, we have the <i>Epistles of the Apostles.</i> Of these fourteen have been penned on particular occasions, and addressed to particular persons, by St. Paul; the others of St. James, St. Peter, St. John, and St. Jude, are called <i>Catholic Epistles,</i> because they are addressed to all Christians in general, if we except the two latter short epistles of St. John. --- The epistles of St. Paul contain admirable advice, and explain fully several tenets of Christianity: but an humble and teachable mind and heart are essentially requisite to draw good from this inexhaustible source. If we prepare our minds by prayer, and go to these sacred oracles with proper dispositions, as to Jesus Christ himself, not preferring our own weak judgment to that of the Catholic Church divinely inspired, and which he has commanded us to hear, and which he has promised to lead in all truth unto the end of the world, we shall improve both our mind and heart by a frequent and pious perusal. We shall learn there that faith is essentially necessary to please God; that this faith is but <i>one,</i> as God is but <i>one;</i> and that faith which shews itself not by good works, is dead. Hence, when St. Paul speaks of works that are incapable of justifying us, he speaks not of the works of moral righteousness, but of the ceremonial works of the Mosaic law, on which the Jews laid such great stress as necessary to salvation. --- St. Peter (in his 2nd Epistle, chap. iii.) assures us that there were some in his time, as there are found some now in our days, who misconstrue St. Paul's epistles, as if he required no good works any more after baptism than before baptism, and maintaining that faith alone would justify and save a man. Hence the other apostles wrote their epistles, as St. Augustine remarks in these words; \"therefore because this opinion, <i>that faith only was necessary to salvation,</i> was started, the other apostolical epistles do most pointedly refute it, forcibly contending <em>that faith without works profiteth nothing</em>.\" Indeed St. Paul himself, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, (Chap. xiii. 2.) positively asserts: <i>if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</i> --- This epistle, like most of the following, is divided into two parts: the first treats of points of doctrine, and extends to the eleventh chapter inclusively; the second treats of morality, and is contained in the last five chapters: but to be able to understand the former, and to practise the latter, humble prayer and a firm adherence to the Catholic Church, which St. Paul (1 Timothy chap. iii.) styles, <i>the pillar and ground of truth,</i> are undoubtedly necessary. Nor should we ever forget what St. Peter affirms, that in St. Paul's epistles <i>there are some things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and the unstable wrest, as they do also the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</i> (2 Peter chap. iii. ver. 16.) (Haydock) --- St. Paul had not been at Rome when he wrote this epistle, which was in the year fifty-seven or fifty-eight, when he was preparing to go to Jerusalem with the charitable contributions and alms, collected in Achaia and Macedonia, for the benefit and relief of the poor Christians in Judea, and at Jerusalem; and after he had preached in almost all places from Jerusalem even to <i>Illyris, Illyrium,</i> or <i>Illyricum.</i> See this Epistle, chap. xv. It was written in Greek. It is not the first epistle in order of time, though placed first, either because of the dignity of the chief Christian Church, or of its sublime contents. --- The apostle's chief design was not only to unite all the new Christian converts, whether they had been Gentiles or Jews, in the same faith, but also to bring them to an union in charity, love, and peace; to put an end to those disputes and contentions among them, which were particularly occasioned by those zealous Jewish converts, who were for obliging all Christians to the observance of the Mosaic precepts and ceremonies. They who had been Jews, boasted that they were the elect people of God, preferred before all other nations, to whom he had given his written law, precepts, and ceremonies by Moses, to whom he had sent his prophets, and had performed so many miracles in their favour, while the Gentiles were left in their ignorance and idolatry. The Gentiles, now converted, were apt to brag of the learning of their great philosophers, and that sciences had flourished among them: they reproached the Jews with the disobedience of their forefathers to God, and the laws he had given them; that they had frequently returned to idolatry; that they had persecuted and put to death the prophets, and even their Messias, the true Son of God. St. Paul shews that neither the Jew nor the Gentile had reason to boast, but to humble themselves under the hand of God, the author of their salvation. He puts the Jews in mind, that they could not expect to be justified and saved merely by the ceremonies and works of their law, though good in themselves; that the Gentiles, as well as they, were now called by the pure mercy of God: that they were all to be saved by believing in Christ, and complying with his doctrine; that <i>sanctification</i> and <i>salvation</i> can only be had by the Christian faith. He does not mean by faith only, as it is one particular virtue, different from charity, hope, and other Christian virtues; but he means by faith, the Christian religion, and worship, taken in opposition to the <i>law of Moses</i> and to the <i>moral virtues of heathens.</i> The design of the Epistle to the Galatians is much the same. From the 12th chapter he exhorts them to the practice of Christian virtues. (Witham)"
