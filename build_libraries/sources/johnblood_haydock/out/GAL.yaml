      v:001:
        - "GAL:1:1 | 1 | 1, &c | The apostle begins by asserting his apostleship which the false teachers had called in question. He was called to it by Christ himself, in his miraculous conversion, being changed \"into a vessel of election to carry his name before kings and nations, and the children of Israel.\" Thus chosen, we see him immediately after his conversion, preaching in Damascus and Arabia. (Calmet) --- Let us beware of self-appointed teachers, who are neither called by God nor rightly ordained by men, and yet are observed to intrude themselves into the ministry. --- <i>Not from man, neither by man.</i>[1] The apostle here expressly says, all the brethren who are with me; to shew that he advanced nothing which was not conformable to the belief of all the faithful. (St. Jerome) --- And again he says, (ver. 12.) <i>neither did I receive it from man, nor did I learn it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</i> That is, not from him, who was a man only, but from Jesus Christ, who was both God and man. St. Jerome, who has left us a commentary on this epistle, (tom. iv. p. 222. Ed. Ben. as also St. Chrysostom, tom. iii. p. 709. Ed. Sav.) takes notice, that Christ's divinity is proved from these expressions, that St. Paul was not an apostle, nor had his mission from man only, but from Jesus Christ, who therefore was not a man only. --- <i>By Jesus Christ and God the Father.</i> A second argument to shew the equality of the Son with the Father. And thirdly, it destroys another objection of the Arians, who used to pretend that the Father, being always first named, he only, and not the Son, was properly God. Fourthly, another of their arguments to prove only the Father truly God, was that he was called <i>the God,</i> with the Greek article; and here the Father is called God, without the said Greek article. Fifthly, they also pretended that the Son was not God, because the Father was said to deliver him to death: and here (ver. 3.) the Son is said <i>to give</i> and <i>deliver</i> himself. (Witham)"
      v:006:
        - 'GAL:1:6 | 6 | 6-7 | This was about three or four years after their conversion. The apostle knowing very well how to suit his discourse to his auditors, in this epistle makes use of a more severe and harsh address than is observable in his other epistles. The reason is, the Galatians were a less civilized people, and had already shewn the little attachment they had to their spiritual father. (Calmet) --- <i>To another gospel: which is not</i>[2] <i>another.</i> That is, it is not properly another, because they pretended to be Christians, and teach the faith: and yet it was in some measure <i>another,</i> because <i>changed</i> by such teachers with a mixture of errors, particularly that all converted Gentiles were to observe the Jewish law: and in this sense, they are said <i>to subvert,</i> or destroy <i>the gospel of Christ:</i> so that the apostle hesitates not to pronounce and repeat <i>an anathema, a curse</i> upon all that preach any thing <i>besides,</i> that is, in point of religion, not agreeing with what he had taught. I cannot omit here a reflection, which St. Chrysostom makes on the 7th verse. <i>Where are they,</i> saith he, <i>who condemn us</i> (Catholics) <i>for the differences</i> we have with heretics? and <i>who pretend there is no</i> such essential <i>difference betwixt us and them,</i> so as to judge them excluded from the communion of the Catholic Church, out of which there is no salvation, unless perhaps through ignorance. --- <i>Let them hear what St. Paul says, that they destroyed the gospel who made any such innovations:</i> to wit, by introducing again as necessary some of the Jewish ceremonies, even at a time when the Christians, who had been Jews, might lawfully use them, and even they who had been Gentiles. St. Paul says, this is to <i>change</i> and <i>destroy</i> the gospel; he repeats <i>anathema</i> against them. Let them hear, and take notice of this, who pretend that the unity of the one Catholic faith is sufficiently maintained by all Christian societies, that agreeing, as they say, in fundamentals, their faith is a saving faith: that the council of Trent, without reason, pronounced such anathemas against them: that all Catholics are uncharitable for denying them to be in the way to salvation, when they make Scripture alone, as interpreted by their private judgment, the only rule of their faith. They may as well accuse not only St. Chrysostom but also St. Paul, of <i>uncharitableness,</i> &c. (Witham)'
      v:009:
        - 'GAL:1:9 | 9 | 9 | The terrible sentence awarded by St. Paul, bears equally strong against modern as against ancient innovators in religion.'
      v:010:
        - 'GAL:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>If I did yet please men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</i> I should not have embraced the Christian faith, I who was so zealous against it, and who by changing have exposed himself to persecutions, &c. (Witham)'
      v:014:
        - 'GAL:1:14 | 14 | 14 | He here alludes to his being a Pharisee, as he himself mentions more openly in Acts xxiii. 6. <i>A Pharisee, and son of Pharisees.</i> This sect always distinguished itself by its zeal for ancient traditions, which shews evidently that he was very far from being instructed in a religion of which he was the sworn enemy; nor since his conversion did he apply for instruction. What he delivered, he learned not of man, but of God. See below.'
      v:016:
        - 'GAL:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>I condescended not to flesh and blood.</i> Literally, <i>I did not acquiesce to flesh and blood.</i> I had no regard to temporal friends or advantages. Some expound it, I did not think it necessary to consult the other apostles, men who were my countrymen: and so it follows, <i>I came not to Jerusalem to the apostles,</i> to be instructed by them, having been instructed by Christ himself. (Witham)'
      v:017:
        - 'GAL:1:17 | 17 | 17 | So far from receiving his apostleship from the other apostles, he saw none of them, till he had spent three years in announcing the word of God. (Calmet) --- In this epistle to the Galatians, St. Paul treats the same matter as in his epistle to the Romans; to the former he writes less exactly and more briefly, as very rude and uncivilized; to the latter, with more precision, and with greater copiousness, as <i>replenished with all knowledge:</i> repleti omni scientia. (Romans xv. 14.)'
      v:018:
        - 'GAL:1:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Then three years after, I came to Jerusalem to see</i> (and as St. Chrysostom says, out of respect to make a visit to) <i>Peter,</i> but staid only at Jerusalem fifteen days, and saw none of the apostles except him, and James, the brother, or cousin of our Lord; so that I was yet unknown by face to the Christian churches in Judea. (Witham)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "GAL:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Then fourteen years after.</i> That is, after my former going to Jerusalem, which was seventeen years after my conversion, an. 51[the year A.D. 51]. See Tillemont. (Witham) The cause of St. Paul's second journey to Jerusalem was as follows. Some brethren coming from Judea to Antioch, there maintained the necessity of circumcision and the other Mosaic rites, asserting that without them salvation could not be obtained. St. Paul, upon his return to Antioch, strongly defended, in conjunction with Barnabas, the liberty of the gospel. As the contest grew warm, it was resolved to depute Paul and Barnabas to consult the other apostles and ancients of Jerusalem. By the approbation of the living and speaking tribunal, which all are commanded to hear, the Scriptures are not made true, altered or amended; they merely are declared to be the infallible word of God, a point only to be learned by authority; hence that memorable saying of St. Augustine: \"I would not believe the gospel unless the authority of the Church moved me.\" (Conta ep. fund. chap. v.)"
      v:002:
        - 'GAL:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>According to revelation,</i> or an inspiration from the Spirit of God, and conferred with them, as an equal, says St. Jerome. --- <i>But apart to them, who seemed to be something</i> considerable. That is, with the other apostles, <i>lest I should run in vain,</i> not for fear of false doctrine, says St. Chrysostom, but that others might be convinced that I preached not any thing disapproved by the apostles, which would prejudice the progress of the gospel. (Witham) --- The particle <i>but,</i> which begins this verse, is quite useless: the Latin Vulgate and the Greek copies have it indeed, but in many copies it is not found; it is omitted also by St. Jerome and Theodoret; and this verse is united in sense with the preceding. Titus was not compelled to be circumcised on account of the false brethren, &c.'
      v:003:
        - 'GAL:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Neither Titus....circumcised,</i> who had been a Gentile. A convincing proof, says St. Chrysostom, that even according to the other apostles, the Gentiles converted, were not subject to the Jewish laws. (Witham)'
      v:005:
        - 'GAL:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>To whom we yielded not.</i> St. Jerome takes notice that in some Latin copies read, <i>to whom we yielded;</i> but that was not the true reading by the Greek and Syriac. (Witham)'
      v:007:
        - 'GAL:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>As to Peter was that of the circumcision.</i> Calvin pretends to prove by this, that St. Peter and his successors are not head of the whole Church, because St. Peter was only the apostle of the Jews. But St. Paul speaks not here of the power and jurisdiction, but of the manner that St. Peter and he were to be employed. It was judged proper that St. Peter should preach chiefly to the Jews, who had been the elect people of God, and that St. Paul should be sent to the Gentiles; yet both of them preached both to Jews and Gentiles: and St. Peter, by receiving Cornelius, first opened the gate of salvation to the Gentiles, as he says of himself, (Acts xv. 7.) <i>that God made choice</i> of him, that <i>the Gentiles</i> by his <i>mouth should hear the gospel, and believe.</i> That St. Peter was head of the Church, see the notes on Matthew xvi. and John xxi. (Witham)'
      v:009:
        - "GAL:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>James, and Cephas, and John.</i> No proof of any greater authority can be drawn from the placing or numbering of James first, which perhaps St. Paul might do, because of the great respect he knew the Jewish converts had for St. James, bishop of Jerusalem, where the ceremonies of the law of Moses were still observed. Several Greek copies have <i>Peter, James, and John.</i> So we also read in St. Jerome's Commentary, p. 240, and St. Chrysostom in his Exposition, p. 729, has <i>Cephas, John, and James.</i> (Witham)"
      v:011:
        - "GAL:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>But when Cephas,</i> &c.[1] In most Greek copies, we read <i>Petrus,</i> both here and ver. 13. Nor are there any sufficient, nor even probable grounds to judge, that <i>Cephas</i> here mentioned was different from <i>Peter,</i> the prince of the apostles, as one or two later authors would make us believe. Among those who fancied Cephas different from Peter, not one can be named in the first ages[centuries], except Clemens of Alexandria, whose works were rejected as apocryphal by Pope Gelasius. The next author is Dorotheus of Tyre, in his Catalogue of the seventy-two disciples, in the fourth or fifth age[century], and after him the like, or same catalogue, in the seventh age[century], in the Chronicle, called of Alexandria, neither of which are of any authority with the learned, so many evident faults and falsehoods being found in both. St. Jerome indeed on this place says, there were some (though he does not think fit to name them) who were of that opinion; but at the same time St. Jerome ridicules and rejects it as groundless. Now as to authors that make Cephas the same with St. Peter, the prince of the apostles, we have what may be called the unexceptionable and unanimous consent of the ancient fathers and doctors of the Catholic Church, as of Tertullian, who calls this management of St. Peter, <i>a fault of conversation, not of preaching</i> or doctrine. Of St. Cyprian, of Origen, of the great doctors, St. Jerome, St. Augustine, St. Chrysostom, St. Gregory the Great, of St. Cyril of Alexandria, of Theodoret, Pope Gelasius, Pelagius the second, St. Anselm, St. Thomas Aquinas. In later ages, of Bellarmine, Baronius, Binius, Spondan, of Salmeron, Estius, Gagneius, Tirinus, Menochius, Alex Natalis, and a great many more: so that Cornelius a Lapide on this place says, <i>that the Church neither knows, nor celebrates any other Cephas but St. Peter.</i> Tertullian and most interpreters take notice, that St. Peter's fault was only a lesser or venial sin in his conduct and <i>conversation.</i> Did not St. Paul on several occasions do the like, as what is here laid to St. Peter's charge? that is, practise the Jewish ceremonies: did not he circumcise Timothy after this, an. 52[A.D. 52]? did he not <i>shave his</i> head in <i>Cenchrea,</i> an. 54? did he not by the advice of St. James (an. 58.) <i>purify himself</i> with the <i>Jews in the temple,</i> not to offend them? St. Jerome, and also St. Chrysostom,[2] give another exposition of this passage. They looked upon all this to have been done by a contrivance and a collusion betwixt these two apostles, who had agreed beforehand that St. Peter should let himself <i>be reprehended</i> by St. Paul, (for this they take to be signified by the Greek text) and not that St. Peter was <i>reprehensible;</i>[3] so that the Jews seeing St. Peter publicly blamed, and not justifying himself, might for the future eat with the Gentiles. But St. Augustine vigorously opposed this exposition of St. Jerome, as less consistent with a Christian and apostolical sincerity, and with the text in this chapter, where it is called a <i>dissimulation,</i> and that Cephas or Peter <i>walked not uprightly to the truth of the gospel.</i> After a long dispute betwixt these two doctors, St. Jerome seems to have retracted his opinion, and the opinion of St. Augustine is commonly followed, that St. Peter was guilty of a venial fault of imprudence. In the mean time, no Catholic denies but that the head of the Church may be guilty even of great sins. What we have to admire, is the humility of St. Peter on this occasion, as St. Cyprian observes,[4] who took the reprehension so mildly, without alleging <i>the primacy, which our Lord had given him.</i> Baronius held that St. Peter did not sin at all, which may be true, if we look upon his intention only, which was to give no offence to the Jewish converts; but if we examine the fact, he can scarce be excused from a <i>venial indiscretion.</i> (Witham) --- <i>I withstood,</i> &c. The fault that is here noted in the conduct of St. Peter, was only a certain imprudence, in withdrawing himself from the table of the Gentiles, for fear of giving offence to the Jewish converts: but this in such circumstances, when his so doing might be of ill consequence to the Gentiles, who might be induced thereby to think themselves obliged to conform to the Jewish way of living, to the prejudice of their Christian liberty. Neither was St. Paul's reprehending him any argument against his supremacy; for is such cases an inferior may, and sometimes ought, with respect, to admonish his superior. (Challoner){JOIN}<b>Ver. 16. &c.</b> <em>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law.</em> St. Paul, to the end of the chapter, seems to continue his discourse to St. Peter, but chiefly to the Jewish Galatians, to shew that both the Gentiles, whom the Jews called and looked upon <i>as sinners,</i> and also the Jews, when converted, could only hope to be <i>justified</i> and saved by the faith of Christ, and not <i>by the works of the law.</i> --- <i>But if while we seek to be justified in Christ,</i> by faith in him, and by his grace, <i>we ourselves also are found sinners,</i> as the false doctors teach you, and not to be justified but by the ceremonies and works of the law of Moses, this blasphemous consequence must follow, <i>that Christ is the minister</i> and author <i>of sin,</i> by making us believe that by faith in him, and complying with his doctrine, we may be justified and saved. For thus we must be considered <i>transgressors,</i> unless we renew and <i>build again</i> what Christ and we have destroyed. --- <i>For by the law I am dead to the law.</i> That is, says St. Jerome, by the evangelical law of Christ I am dead to the ancient law and its ceremonies. Others expound it, that by the law and its types and figures, and by the predictions contained in the law, I know the Mosaical law hath now ceased, in which sense he might say, <i>by the law I am dead to the law.</i> --- <i>If justice.</i> That is, if justification and salvation be to be had, or could have been had <em>by the</em> works of <em>the law; therefore Christ died in vain,</em> and it was not necessary that he should become our Redeemer. (Witham)"
      v:019:
        - 'GAL:2:19 | 19 | 19 | He here expresses the change which had been wrought in him. The law to which he had been attached, had passed away from him. Now he was so united to Christ and his cross, that he says: Not I, but Christ liveth in me. The strong expressions made use of by St. Paul with regard to the Jewish law in this chapter, may appear strange, and very capable of a wrong interpretation. But we must ever bear in mind that St. Paul speaks exclusively of the <i>ceremonial</i> part of the law, and not of the <i>moral,</i> contained in the decalogue: of this latter he says in his epistle to the Romans, (ii. 13.) the doers of the law shall be justified. But to effect this, was and is necessary the grace which Jesus Christ has merited and obtained for all, grace which God has shed on all, more or less, from the commencement of the world.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'GAL:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Before whose eyes Jesus Christ....crucified among you.</i>[1] The common exposition is, that St. Paul had <i>before described</i> and set before them Christ crucified. Others, that it had been clearly foretold by the prophets that Christ was crucified for them. (Witham)'
      v:002:
        - 'GAL:3:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law?</i> As if he said, you esteem it a great favour to have received those spiritual gifts of working miracles, &c. When you were made Christians, had you these favours <i>by the works of the law,</i> or was it not <i>by the hearing of faith,</i> and by the faith of Christ, that you had such extraordinary graces? and when you <i>have begun</i> thus happily by the <i>spirit</i> of Christ and his spiritual gifts, are you for <i>finishing</i> and thinking to make yourselves more <i>perfect</i> by the exterior works of the law, the circumcision of the flesh, and such like ceremonies? (Witham)'
      v:004:
        - 'GAL:3:4 | 4 | 4-5 | <i>If yet in vain:</i> i.e. I have still good hopes, that what you have already suffered by persecutions and self-denials, since your conversion, will not be in vain; as they would be, if you sought to be justified by the works and ceremonies of the law of Moses, and not by the faith and law of Christ, by which only you can be truly sanctified. (Witham) --- St. Jerome, St. Augustine, and others, suppose that the power of working miracles still remained in the Galatians, notwithstanding what had passed; but St. Chrysostom and several others, explain it of a power they had formerly possessed. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'GAL:3:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.</i> See Romans iv. 3. They only who imitate the faith of Abraham shall <i>be blessed</i> with him, and are his spiritual <i>children,</i> whether Jews or Gentiles, whom God promised to bless by the seed of Abraham; i.e. by Christ, who descended from Abraham. (Witham) --- The apostle thus argues with the Galatians; Abraham, who was never under the law, still received the grace of justification in reward of his faith, even before he had received circumcision. Now, if a person can be justified without the law, the law can be no ways necessary to salvation. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - "GAL:3:10 | 10 | 10-14 | <i>Are under a curse....cursed is every man,</i> &c. The sense of these is to be found in Deuteronomy xxvii. 26. in the Septuagint. Some expound them thus: curses are pronounced against every one who keeps not all the precepts of the law, but there is not any one; i.e. scarce any one, who keepeth them all; therefore all under the law are under some curse. But as it cannot be said that no one kept all the precepts, especially the moral precepts of the law, mentioned in that place of Deuteronomy; (for Zacharias and <i>Elizabeth were both just in the sight of God,</i> Luke i., and doubtless many others lived so as not to incur those curses, but were just and were saved, though not by virtue of the works of the law only, nor without faith in God, and in their Redeemer, who was to come) therefore others understand that all such persons fall under these curses, who think to comply with all these precepts by their own strength, or who confide in the works of the law only, without faith in Christ, the Messias, and without which they cannot be saved. This agrees with what follows, that <i>the just man liveth by faith.</i> (Habacuc ii. 4.) See Romans i. 17. --- <i>Now</i> the law is not of faith, i.e. the works done merely in compliance with the law, are not works of faith that can save a man: <i>but he that doth those things</i> of the law, <i>shall live in them;</i> i.e. says St. Jerome, shall have a long temporal life promised in the law; or, as others say, shall have life everlasting, if they are done with faith. --- <i>Christ hath redeemed us</i> from these curses; but to do this, hath made <i>himself a curse</i> for <i>our</i> sake, by taking upon himself the similitude of a sinner, and by dying upon the cross, as if he had been guilty of the greatest sins, having only charged himself with our sins, inasmuch as it <i>is written:</i> (Deuteronomy xxi. 23.) <i>cursed is every one who hangeth on a tree;</i> which is to be understood, in case he deserve it for his own sins. --- <i>That the blessing of Abraham</i> (or promised to Abraham) <i>might be fulfilled;</i> i.e. Christ redeemed us, that these blessings might be fulfilled on all nations, and that all might receive the <i>promise of the Spirit,</i> or the promised spirit of grace believing in Christ, who is now come. (Witham){JOIN}<b>Ver. 15, &c.</b> <i>I speak after the manner of man;</i> or, by a comparison, says St. Chrysostom, common among men. If a man make or execute his last will, or any deed or contract, it stands good; no one <i>contemns</i> it, or pretends to annul it, or add <i>any</i> thing to it: how much more shall the testament, the covenant, or solemn promise which God made to Abraham, to bless all nations, stand firm and have its effect? And he said to <i>his seed,</i> to <i>one,</i> i.e. in <i>Christ only,</i> not to <i>his seeds, as it were by many.</i> It is observed, that the word <i>seed</i> being a collective signification, may grammatically be taken for the plural as well as for the singular number; so that we are to have more regard to St. Paul's authority, who expounds to us what is here signified by the word seed, than to the word itself. --- <i>The law which was made after four hundred and thirty years</i> (consult the chronologists) does not make void the testament: nor the <i>promise</i> which God himself made to Abraham, that mankind should be blessed only by Christ. These blessings could not be by the law of Moses <i>ordained,</i> or delivered <i>by angels</i> in the <i>hand of a mediator,</i> to wit, of Moses, according to the common interpretation, who, in receiving and publishing the law, was as it were a mediator betwixt God and his people. --- And <i>a mediator is not of one,</i> (but is called so, as mediating betwixt two parties) <i>but God is one.</i> This is to signify, that when he made the covenant or promise to Abraham, he made this promise himself, and did not make use of a mediator inferior to himself, as when he gave the law; and the law, in this respect, was inferior to the promise; but the chief difference was, that true justice and sanctification was not given by the law, for so it would have contradicted and have made void the promise made before to Moses[Abraham?], that the blessings of true sanctification should only be by his seed and by faith in Christ, the Son of Abraham and of David. According to the Scriptures all things (i.e. all men) were shut up together <i>under sin,</i> under the slavery of sin, from which they were not to be redeemed but by the accomplishment of the promise, and by the coming of Christ, by his grace, and faith in him. (Witham) --- <i>Because of transgressions.</i> To restrain them from sin, by fear and threats. --- <i>Ordained by Angels.</i> The law was delivered by Angels, speaking in the name and person of God to Moses, who was the <i>mediator</i> on this occasion between God and the people. (Challoner) --- The law was established not to occasion sin, but to <i>manifest</i> sin, and to <i>punish</i> sin. Ezechiel (xx. 11.) shews the meaning of the apostle, when he says: that God, after bringing the Israelites out of Egypt, imposed laws upon them that gave life to such as observed them. This was the decalogue, published immediately after the passage of the Red Sea; but violating these commandments, they became guilty of idolatry. To <i>punish</i> them, God imposed upon them precepts <i>which are not good, and which give not life.</i> (ver. 24, 25.) This is the ceremonial law, which was established and published by degrees during the forty years the Israelites sojourned in the desert. It is then evident that this law was given to punish transgressions in the Israelites, and to prevent relapses. This is the sense of St. Paul."
      v:022:
        - 'GAL:3:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Hath concluded all under sin;</i> i.e. hath declared all to be under sin, from which they could not be delivered but by faith in Jesus Christ, the promised seed. (Challoner) --- The law was not given to all; but all its precepts and prohibitions were binding under sin, and all violators of the law were guilty of sin.'
      v:024:
        - 'GAL:3:24 | 24 | 24 | As for the <i>law,</i> it <i>was put</i> or given <i>because of transgressions,</i> to put a stop, by the punishments prescribed, to idolatry and other crimes, which the Jews had learnt from other nations, particularly in Egypt. The law was a <i>pedagogue,</i> or schoolmaster, to direct and correct and bring men to Christ, our chief Master, our great Mediator, who being now come, we are no longer under our former pedagogue. Christ hath by his grace made all, who believe in him and follow his doctrine, his <i>sons</i> and his adoptive children, whether they were before <i>Jews</i> or <i>Gentiles;</i> now they are all <i>one,</i> united in the same <i>faith,</i> and in the same spirit of charity. All the faithful are to be accounted of <i>the seed</i> of Abraham, and his spiritual children by the accomplishment of the promise. (Witham) --- <i>Pedagogue;</i> i.e. schoolmaster, conductor, or instructor. (Challoner)'

    commentary:
      v:003:
        - 'GAL:4:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Under the elements of the world.</i> St. Chrysostom understands the exterior ceremonies and precepts of the law of Moses, with an allusion to the first elements or rudiments which children are taught. (Witham)'
      v:004:
        - 'GAL:4:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>The fulness of the time.</i> That is, the time decreed by Divine Providence. --- <i>God sent his Son made of a woman,</i> who took a true human body of his virgin Mother. --- <i>Under the law,</i> as he was man, because he was pleased to make himself so. (Witham)'
      v:006:
        - 'GAL:4:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Crying, Abba.</i> That is, <i>Father;</i> Christ taught us in prayer to call God <i>our Father,</i> he having made us his adoptive <i>sons</i> by his grace, and <i>heirs</i> of heaven. (Witham)'
      v:008:
        - 'GAL:4:8 | 8 | 8-9 | <i>You served them, who by nature are no gods.</i> These words are to be understood of the converts, who had been Gentiles. --- <i>Known of God.</i> That is, approved and loved by him. (Witham) --- The language of the apostle in this verse is not perhaps strictly precise. The Galatians, whom he addresses, had been converted from paganism, and of course were never subject to the law of Moses. But the apostle, by these words, entreats them not to begin now to serve these weak and useless elements, (as he calls the Jewish rites) or by this expression he may mean (as St. Chrysostom and Theophylactus explain it) the tyranny of error and wickedness. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - "GAL:4:10 | 10 | 10-11 | <i>You observe</i> [1] <i>days,</i> &c. These false teachers were for obliging all Christians to observe all the Jewish feasts, fasts, ceremonies, &c. Some of the later reformers find here an occasion to blame the fasts and holydays kept by Catholics. St. Jerome, in his commentary on these words, tells us that some had made the like objection in his time: his answer might reasonably stop their rashness; to wit, that Christians keep indeed the sabbath on the Sunday, (not the Jewish sabbath on Saturdays) that they keep also divers holydays, and days on which great saints suffered martyrdom, (let our adversaries take notice of this) but that both the days are different, and the motives of keeping them. See St. Jerome, tom. iv. p. 271. (Witham) --- This text cannot mean to condemn the feasts appointed to be kept holy in the Catholic Church. For on the festivals dedicated to our Lord, St. Augustine writeth thus: \"We dedicate and consecrate the memory of God's benefits with solemnities on solemn appointed days, lest in process of time they might creep into ungrateful and unkind oblivion.\" And of the martyrs thus: \"Christian people celebrate the memories of martyrs with religious solemnity, both to move themselves to an imitation of their virtues, and that they may be partakers of their merits, and helped by their prayers.\" (Conta Faust. lib. xx. chap. 21.) And of other saints thus: \"keep ye and celebrate with sobriety the nativity of saints, that we may imitate them that are gone before us, and that they may rejoice in us, who pray for us.\" (In Ps. lxxxviii. Conc. 2. in fine.)"
      v:012:
        - 'GAL:4:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Be ye as I, for I also am as you.</i> I add no word in the translation, because it is uncertain what is to be understood: some give this construction, be you as <i>I am,</i> because I also <i>was,</i> as you now <i>are;</i> and they expound them thus: lay aside your zeal for the Jewish ceremonies as I have done, who <i>was</i> once as zealous for them as you seem now to be. Others would have the construction and sense to be: be you as I <i>am,</i> because I <i>am</i> as you; that is, be affected to me, and love me, as I have still a true affection and love for you, which is agreeable to what follows, <i>you have not offended me at all.</i> (Witham)'
      v:013:
        - 'GAL:4:13 | 13 | 13-16 | <i>Through infirmity of the flesh....and your temptation in my flesh.</i> St. Jerome thinks the apostle had some bodily infirmity upon him. St. Chrysostom understands his poverty, and want, and persecutions, and that some were inclined to contemn him and his preaching on these accounts. Yet others among them did not esteem him less: they received him, respected him as an <i>Angel of God,</i> as <i>Christ Jesus;</i> they would have given him <i>their eyes,</i> as one may say, and all that was dear to them. He puts them in mind how <i>happy</i> then they thought themselves, and asketh why they are now so much <i>changed?</i> (Witham)'
      v:017:
        - 'GAL:4:17 | 17 | 17-20 | He tells them this change comes from the false teachers among them, who with a false <i>zeal</i> would <i>exclude them</i> from a friendship and a submission to St. Paul, and deprive them again of that Christian liberty by which Christ, and the faith of Christ, had freed them from the yoke of the Mosaical law. On this account I must labor and <i>travail,</i> as it were to <i>bring you</i> forth a second time. How do <i>I now wish</i> to be <i>with you,</i> to <i>change my voice,</i> to exhort you, to reprehend you, to use all ways and means to regain you to Christ? --- <i>I am in confusion about you,</i>[2] I am perplexed, as the Greek signifies, as not knowing what to say or do.

        - "GAL:4:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>It is written</i> in the law, that is, in Genesis, (chap. xvi. and chap. xxi.) that <i>Abraham had two sons,</i> &c. that his two sons, <i>Ismael,</i> born of his servant, <i>Agar,</i> and <i>Isaac</i> of his wife, <i>Sara,</i> in an <i>allegorical sense,</i> represent the two <i>testaments</i> or covenants, which God made with his people: that by <i>Ismael</i> was represented that covenant of the former law delivered to Moses on Mount Sina, by which the Jews were made his elect people, yet as it were his <i>servants,</i> to be kept to their duty by fear of punishments; but by <i>Isaac</i> is represented the new covenant or testament of <i>Christ,</i> given at Jerusalem, where he suffered, where the new law was first published; by which law, they who believe in Christ were made the spiritual children of Abraham, the <i>sons</i> of God, and heirs of the blessings promised to Abraham: that <i>Sina,</i> the <i>mountain in Arabia,</i> hath[3] <i>an affinity with Jerusalem,</i> and <i>with her children,</i> who remain under the <i>servitude</i> of the law of Moses: we cannot understand a <i>conjunction,</i> or an <i>affinity,</i> as to place and situation, Sina and Jerusalem being near twenty days' journey distant from each other; therefore it can only be an affinity in a mystical signification, inasmuch as Jerusalem was the capital of the Jews, where the children of those who received the law on Mount Sina lived still under the servitude of the same law: but Christians, who believe in Christ, must look upon themselves as belonging to Jerusalem, and not to the city of Jerusalem upon earth, but to the celestial Jerusalem in heaven, which is our <i>mother,</i> now no longer servants and slaves to the former law, but <i>free,</i> being made the <i>sons</i> of God by the grace of Christ, and heirs of heaven. And these blessings were promised to all nations, not only to the Jews, of which the much greater part remained obstinate, and refused to believe in Christ, but also particularly to the Gentiles, according to the prophecy of Isaias, (chap. liv.) <i>rejoice thou</i> that hast been <i>barren,</i> like <i>Sara,</i> for a long time; i.e. rejoice, you Gentiles, hitherto left in idolatry, without the knowledge or worship of the true God, now you shall have more children among you than among the Jews, who were his chosen people. (Witham)"
      v:029:
        - 'GAL:4:29 | 29 | 29 | St. Paul makes another observation upon this example of Ismael and Isaac: that as Ismael was troublesome to Isaac, for which he and his mother were turned out of the family, <i>so also now</i> the Jews insulted and persecuted the Christians, who had been Gentiles; but God will protect them as heirs of the blessings promised: they shall be accounted the spiritual children of Abraham, while the Jews, with their carnal ceremonies, shall be cast off. (Witham) --- This, says St. Augustine, is a figure of heretics, (who are the children of the bond-woman) unjustly persecuting the Catholic Church. (Ep. 48.)'

      v:001:
        - 'GAL:5:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Be not held again under the yoke of bondage,</i> of the old law. (Witham) --- This verse must be understood in the same manner as the 9th verse of the preceding chapter. See the annotations upon it.'
      v:002:
        - 'GAL:5:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>If you</i> converted from heathenism <i>be circumcised,</i> it must be by believing and professing it necessary, which is false doctrine, and then <i>Christ will profit you nothing:</i> not that the practice of those ceremonies was at the time sinful, especially for those that had been Jews, but it was an error to judge them necessary for converted Gentiles. Besides, he that judges circumcision necessary, must also judge himself bound to keep all the other ceremonies and precepts of the law. (Witham)'
      v:003:
        - 'GAL:5:3 | 3 | 3 | The false teachers had insisted on the observance of circumcision and a few other rites only, as necessary for salvation; but St. Paul assures them, that the receiving of circumcision is an open profession of Judaism, and that he that makes this profession, binds himself to the observance of every part of the law, since a curse is pronounced against those that do not keep it in all its parts. If then circumcision be necessary for salvation, the whole law is necessary also. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - 'GAL:5:4 | 4 | 4 | If you think that justice cannot be obtained but under the law, you make a renunciation of the justice of Christ: his mediation becomes of no avail to you. (Calmet)'

        - "GAL:5:5 | 5 | 5-6 | <i>We in spirit</i> hope for true <i>justice</i> by <i>faith</i> in Christ; yet not by faith only, but by faith <i>working by charity.</i> (Witham) --- Here note with St. Augustine, that faith is not to be idle, but working or doing good works in charity: wherefore not faith alone. (De opere et fide. chap. xiv.){JOIN}<b>Ver. 8, &c.</b> <i>This persuasion</i> of yours <i>is not from him who calleth you;</i> is not from God: and <i>I hope</i> you will be shortly again of no <i>other mind</i> than what I taught you. (Witham) --- This was a Jewish proverb, and alluded to the time of the Pasch, when it was not permitted to eat of any but unleavened bread; during which time the least leaven made the whole mass unclean to a Jew....Some Greek copies read, {GREEK:START mikra zume olon to phurama zumoi}μικρα ζυμη ολον το φυραμα ζυμοι{GREEK:END}, when the sense will be, \"a little leaven causes the whole mass to rise.\" (Calmet) --- Hence the introduction of any, however small, share of the ceremonial and Jewish rites, will greatly disfigure the purity and simplicity of the Christian institute. --- As <i>for me,</i> my adversaries misrepresent me, when they say I preach circumcision; which if I did, I should not be persecuted as I am by the Jews. I never preach it necessary for Gentiles converted, though I have not condemned the use of it in the Jewish converts, provided they do not oblige other converts to it. --- <i>The scandal of the cross is therefore made void.</i> The sense is, according to St. Jerome, that the Jews' greatest objection against St. Paul used to be, because he preached that circumcision and the law of Moses need not be observed: another objection against him was, that he preached Jesus, who was crucified on an infamous cross, to be their great Messias. He reasons then in this manner, that if the Jews think he again preacheth the necessity of circumcision and the precepts of the old law, they will no longer be offended that he preacheth Christ crucified, because they were not so much offended with the latter as with the first. Thus also St. Chrysostom on this verse. Others expound it thus: If I preach circumcision and the ceremonies of the law, therefore according to my doctrine, the cross of Christ, and justification by the merits of Christ crucified, is abolished, because justification is still to be sought for by the works of the law. --- <i>I would they were even cut off:</i> separated from your communion by excommunication. This seems the true sense; so that I need not mention any other exposition. See Cornelius a Lapide. (Witham)"

(St. Augustine, in chap. v. Gal.)'
      v:019:
        - 'GAL:5:19 | 19 | 19-21 | <i>Uncleanness, immodesty, luxury.</i> In the Greek there are but two vices named; <i>luxury</i> is not mentioned; and, perhaps, the Latin interpreter put two words to explain one Greek word. (Witham) --- St. Augustine here sheweth that there are other damnable sins besides infidelity.'
      v:022:
        - 'GAL:5:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>The fruit of the Spirit is charity,</i> &c. There are numbered twelve of these fruits in the Latin, though but nine in the Greek text, in St. Chrysostom; St. Jerome; St. Augustine, tract. lxxxvii. in Joan. p. 756. The difference may again happen by the Latin interpreter using two words to express one Greek word. It is observed, that <i>longanimity</i> and <i>patience</i> are in a manner the same; so are <i>benignity</i> and <i>goodness;</i> and so may be here <i>continency</i> and <i>chastity.</i> (Witham)'

  - PREFACE.
  - "The Galatians, soon after St. Paul had preached the gospel to them, were seduced by some false teachers, who had been Jews, and who were for obliging all Christians, even those who had been Gentiles, to observe circumcision, and the other ceremonies of the Mosaical law. In this epistle he refutes the pernicious doctrine of those teachers, and also their calumny against his mission and apostleship. The subject matter of this epistle is much the same as of that to the Romans. It was written at Ephesus, about twenty-three years after our Lord's ascension. (Challoner) --- The Galatians were originally Gauls, who under their leader, Baennus, spread themselves over Greece, and at length passed over into Asia Minor, where they settled between Cappadocia and Phrygia, in the province afterwards called from them Galatia. It seems that St. Peter preached first in those parts; but it was only to the Jews, as may be gathered from the inscription of his first epistle, which he addresses to the Jews of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. But St. Paul was the first that preached to the Gentile inhabitants of this province. When he first preached to them, he was received as an angel from heaven, or rather, as Christ himself: he visited them oftener than once, and the Church he there formed was very considerable. It was the Jewish converts of Galatia (who, as we have before mentioned, were the spiritual children of St. Peter) that caused those troubles which gave rise to this epistle. They strongly advocated the legal observances; and making a handle of the high pre-eminence of St. Peter, they decried St. Paul, even calling in question his apostleship. They taught the necessity of circumcision, and other Mosaic rites, which the apostles then in part retained. Thus divisions were raised in this infant Church. On these accounts the apostle warmly asserts his apostleship, as being called by Christ himself. He shews that his doctrine was that of the other apostles, who, in the council of Jerusalem, four years before, testified their exemption from the legal observances. He teaches, that it is not by the law, but by faith, that the blessings of salvation are imparted to them. After establishing these more important parts of the epistle, he gives them instruction on various heads. The Greek subscription to this epistle informs us, that it was written from Rome. St. Jerome says, he wrote it when in chains. Theodoret says, it was the first epistle that St. Paul wrote from Rome. This opinion has probably been adopted from a mistaken interpretation of the text: <i>I bear the marks of the wounds of Christ in my body.</i> By these marks they understand chains, whilst the text equally applies to the mortifications and self-denials of a Christian. The contrary opinion is, that this epistle was written from Ephesus in the year of Christ 55. This is the more probable opinion, and is maintained by St. Gregory the Great, Ludovicus, Capellanus, Estius, Usher, Pearson, and many others. The authority of the Greek copies, in assigning the places whence the letters were written, has been long rejected by the learned. We find not such information in the more ancient Greek manuscripts of St. Germanus and Clermont, &c. (Calmet)"
