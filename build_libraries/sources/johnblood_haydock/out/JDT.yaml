    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JDT:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Now,</i> refers to the internal purpose of the author. (St. Gregory, hom 2. in Ezechiel.) (Worthington) Many of the books begin with <i>And;</i> shewing their connection. This work formed a part of the general history. The building of Ecbatana likewise took place soon after the destruction of Ninive, mentioned in the preceding book. --- <i>Arphaxad.</i> He was probably the same as is called <i>Dejoces</i> by Herodotus; to whom he attributes the building of Ecbatana, the capital city of Media; (Challoner) or rather Arphaxad, more resembles both in name and actions the second king Phraortes or Apharaartas, (Montfaucon and Houbigant) who fortified and embellished the city. (Calmet) --- <i>Ecbatana,</i> or Agbata, which in Arabic signifies "variegated;" (Bochart) as the seven walls, rising one higher than another round it, were marked with one white, two black, three red, four blue, five dark red, six silver, seven gold. (Herodotus i. 98.) (Calmet) See Tobias iii. 7.'
      v:002:
        - 'JDT:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Hewed.</i> Greek adds, "three cubits broad and six long." The ancients aimed at solidity in their architecture, as appears from their ruins. (Calmet) --- <i>High.</i> Salien (the year of the world 3345) thinks there is a transposition, and that the walls were 70 cubits high. (Menochius) --- What need was there of such a breadth? Greek allows 70 in height, and 50 in breadth, which seems more proportionate. Old Vulgate has 60 cubits high, and 50 broad. On the walls of Ninive, three chariots might fight abreast, (Calmet) and six on those of Babylon. (Ctesias.) --- <i>Feet.</i> Projecting from the wall, to remove an enemy. (Menochius) --- Greek, "and the towers thereof he placed above the gates 100 cubits, and the foundation was 60 cubits broad. And he made the gates to rise 70 cubits, being 40 cubits in breadth, to send out the armies of his mighty men, and to draw up his infantry." (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'JDT:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Gloried.</i> Fool, this night wilt thou perish, Luke xii. 20. (Worthington)'
      v:005:
        - 'JDT:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Nabuchodonosor.</i> Not the king of Babylon, who took and destroyed Jerusalem, but another of the same name, who reigned in Nivine; and is called by profane historians <i>Saosduchin.</i> He succeeded Asarhaddon in the kingdom of the Assyrians, and was contemporary with Manasses, king of Juda. (Challoner) --- He might be the same with Asarhaddon, who resided at Ninive in the 20th year of his reign. After the defeat at Bethulia, the Medes recovered part of their power, under Cyaxares I., who was succeeded by Astyages and Cyaxares II., with whom Cyrus was associated in the empire. (Xenophon) --- Asarhaddon spent the latter years of his life at Babylon, of which he had made himself master. (Houbigant) --- The Jews frequently give names to foreign princes different from those by which they are known in profane history. See Tobias ultra. (Haydock) --- <i>Him.</i> Greek afterwards (ver. 15) insinuates, that he prevented any from mounting the throne of Media, till this work was written, "he transfixed him with his darts, and destroyed him till this day." (Houbigant)'
      v:006:
        - 'JDT:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Ragau,</i> near Rages. (Tobias i. 16.) (Menochius) --- Syriac, "Dura," mentioned [in] Daniel iii. 1. (Calmet) --- <i>Jadason,</i> or Mount Jason, above the Caspian gates; (Strabo xi.) unless it may be the city Jassu, in Armenia. Greek has "the Hydaspes," a river of India, though Curtius (v.) places it near Susa; confounding it with the Choaspes. --- <i>Elicians.</i> Greek, "Elymeans," perhaps the same with Pontus. Hebrew <i>Ellasar,</i> Genesis xiv. 9. Various battles were fought during this war, which the Greek intimates lasted seven years. (Calmet) --- That version also would represent these and various other nations coming to meet Nabuchodonosor, who hereupon sent his ambassadors to all in Persia, and westward to Cilicia, &c. As they were treated contemptuously, he swore that he would revenge himself. But first he attacked Arphaxad, took and sacked Ninive, slew the king, and then abandoned himself with his army to pleasure in the conquered city, "120 days." (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'JDT:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Esdrelon.</i> Syriac, "Jezrael," which is the usual name in Scripture, Josue xvii. 16.'
      v:009:
        - 'JDT:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Jesse,</i> or Gessen, where Joseph placed his brethren, Genesis xlvi. 34.'
      v:011:
        - 'JDT:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Refused.</i> Greek adds, "and did not come to <i>help</i> him in the war, because they feared him not, (Haydock; supposing he would have enough to do with Arphaxad) as he was but like their equal, <i>or</i> as one man. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'JDT:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Countries.</i> Those who were subject to him did wrong in refusing aid. But the Jews were under no such obligations; and God espoused their cause the more, as the king set up for a deity, chap. iii. (Calmet) --- He had at first entertained thoughts of universal dominion, (Haydock) being elated by his victory, like other conquerors. --- <i>Auferre, trucidare, rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.</i> (Tacitus, Agric.)'

These proposals were made by those on the sea-coast, from Sidon and Tyre to Ascalon, from whom Holofernes took "the choicest men," being received with honour, ver. 10. (Haydock) --- <i>Syria,</i> &c. These are not specified in the Greek. --- <i>Sobal,</i> or Soba, (1 Kings xiv. 47.) near Damascus, where Ptolemy (v.) places Samoulis. --- <i>Lybia</i> seems too remote, and had not been attacked: some therefore would read Lycia, or Lygia, (Herodotus vii. 72.) or rather Lydia, (Calmet) which Holofernes had "cut in pieces," according to the Greek, chap. ii. 13. (Haydock)'

(Haydock) --- Behold to what lengths ambition may be carried. If he had only claimed a place among the other pagan deities, his title was as good as theirs.

(Calmet) --- Yet (Haydock) Gabaa may designate a mountainous country, as 1 Kings vii. 1., (Menochius) and there is no reason why Idumea might not have felt the power of Holofernes, as well as Madian, &c. (Haydock) --- The order of conquests is not observed, (Menochius) for while the commander-in-chief was in one place, his generals were dispersed into different parts. He had now advanced as far as Gabaa of Saul, (Haydock) when meditating a serious attack upon Egypt, he thought proper to concentrate his forces; little expecting to meet with such a check at Bethulia. (Calmet) --- Greek, "He came to Esdrelon, near Dotaia, (or Dothaim, north of Sichem) which is opposite the great saw of Judea," or the range of mountains of Ephraim. (Calmet) --- Old Vulgate, "of Juda," dividing it from Idumea. The kings of Israel had fortified the defiles, 3 Kings xv. 17.'

Resistance, in other circumstances, would have been rashness. (Calmet) --- Greek adds, "because they were recently come up from captivity, and lately all the people had been collected out of Judea, and the vessels, and the altar, and the house, had been purified from profanation," (Haydock) to which they had been exposed under Manasses, (chap. v. 23.; Calmet) who with several of his subjects had been made prisoner, and was now at Babylon; or, if returned, (Haydock) was wholly taken up with the concerns of his soul, and committed the care of affairs to Eliachim.

This reminds us of the heroic resistance which Leonidas, with his 300 Spartans, made to the millions in the army of Xerxes, at Thermopylæ.

The very beasts were covered with sackcloth, to denote the general sorrow. (Haydock)'

But now, returning to their God, they are come up from the places to which they had been scattered, and have possession of Jerusalem, where is their sanctuary; and they have inhabited the mountainous country, for it was a desert." (Haydock) --- Our adversaries would infer from this, and similar passages, that the siege of Bethulia could not have taken place till after the captivity at Babylon; and this many Catholics allow. But the proof is not conclusive, as all this might be verified under Manasses: (Calmet) "the temple was trampled on," (Syriac, {GREEK:START egennethe eis edaphos}ηγηννηθη ηισ ηδαφοσ{GREEK:END}) and profaned. See chap. iv. 2., and 1 Machabees iii. 51., and Luke xxi. 24. It had been pillaged by Sesac and the Assyrians, and had stood in need of great repairs under Ezechias, Josias, &c. Several of the Israelites had escaped from the hands of their oppressors, (2 Paralipomenon xxxiv. 9.) and the Jews had regained their strength after the captivity of Manasses, (Calmet) having retired before into their strong holds in the deserts.

      v:009: 'JDT:6:9 | 9 | 9 | Then turning out of the way by the side of the mountain, they tied Achior to a tree hand and foot, and so left him bound with ropes, and returned to their master.'
      v:010: 'JDT:6:10 | 10 | 10 | And the children of Israel coming down from Bethulia, came to him. And loosing him, they brought him to Bethulia, and setting him in the midst of the people, asked him what was the matter, that the Assyrians had left him bound.'
      v:011: 'JDT:6:11 | 11 | 11 | In those days the rulers there were Ozias, the son of Micha, of the tribe of Simeon, and Charmi, called also Gothoniel.'
      v:012: 'JDT:6:12 | 12 | 12 | And Achior related in the midst of the ancients, and in the presence of all the people, all that he had said, being asked by Holofernes: and how the people of Holofernes would have killed him for this word,'
      v:013: 'JDT:6:13 | 13 | 13 | And how Holofernes himself, being angry, had commanded him to be delivered for this cause to the Israelites: that when he should overcome the children of Israel, then he might command Achior also himself to be put to death by diverse torments, for having said: The God of heaven is their defender.'
      v:014: 'JDT:6:14 | 14 | 14 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And when Achior had declared all these things, all the people fell upon their faces, adoring the Lord, and all of them together, mourning and weeping, poured out their prayers with one accord to the Lord,'

      v:016: "JDT:6:16 | 16 | 16 | So when their weeping was ended, and the people's prayer, in which they continued all the day, was concluded, they comforted Achior,"

Greek and Syriac specify over-against Dothaim, which seems too remote; (Calmet) though such an immense army might cover a great part of the country, as all would not be necessary to besiege Bethulia; and it was agreed only to blockade the place, in order that no men might be lost, and the army might be ready to march against the more distant and powerful nations of Egypt. Another detachment was (Haydock) "southward, at Ecrebel, (Syriac <i>Ekarbat,</i> probably <i>Akrabim,</i> the ascent of the scorpions) near Cush, (or Arabia) which is above the torrent Mochmur, (Syriac <i>Peor,</i> or Bezor; Calmet) and the rest of the army of the Assyrians encamped in the plain, and covered the face of the earth."

      v:003: 'JDT:7:3 | 3 | 3 | All these prepared themselves together to fight against the children of Israel, and they came by the hill side to the top, which looketh toward Dothain, from the place which is called Belma, unto Chelmon, which is over-against Esdrelon.'
      v:004: 'JDT:7:4 | 4 | 4 | But the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude of them, prostrated themselves upon the ground, putting ashes upon their heads, praying, with one accord, that the God of Israel would shew his mercy upon his people.'
      v:005: 'JDT:7:5 | 5 | 5 | And taking their arms of war, they posted themselves at the places, which by a narrow path-way lead directly between the mountains, and they guarded them all day and night.'
      v:006: 'JDT:7:6 | 6 | 6 | Now Holofernes, in going round about, found that the fountain which supplied them with water, ran through an aqueduct without the city, on the south side: and he commanded their aqueduct to be cut off.'
      v:007: 'JDT:7:7 | 7 | 7 | Nevertheless, there were springs not far from the walls, out of which they were seen secretly to draw water, to refresh themselves a little rather than to drink their fill.'
      v:008: 'JDT:7:8 | 8 | 8 | But the children of Ammon, and Moab, came to Holofernes, saying: The children of Israel trust not in their spears, nor in their arrows, but the mountains are their defense, and the steep hires and precipices guard them.'
      v:009: 'JDT:7:9 | 9 | 9 | Wherefore, that thou mayst overcome them without joining battle, set guards at the springs, that they may not draw water out of them, and thou shalt destroy them without sword, or at least being wearied out, they will yield up their city, which they suppose, because it is situate in the mountains, to be impregnable.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JDT:8:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Idox.</i> Greek, "ox," &c. All the versions disagree, as the copyists have probably taken in part of ver. 3 too soon, supposing that the genealogy of women was never given. St. Fulgentius (ep. ad Gallam) differs from all, giving the ancestors of Manasses as the same with those of Judith. (Calmet) --- <i>Simeon, the son of Ruben.</i> In the Greek, it is, <i>the son of Israel.</i> For Simeon, the patriarch, from whom Judith descended, was not the son, but the brother of Ruben. It seems more probable, that the Simeon and the Ruben here mentioned are not the patriarchs, but two of the descendants of the patriarch Simeon: and that the genealogy of Judith, recorded in this place, is not carried up so high as the patriarchs. No more than that of Elcana, the father of Samuel, (1 Kings i. 1.) and that of king Saul, 1 Kings ix. 1. (Challoner) --- Others think that Judith descended from Ruben, by her father, and from Simeon, by her mother; (Estius) or that, instead of <i>son</i> of Ruben, we should read "brother." But as we know that Judith calls Simeon her father, (chap. ix. 2.) it is more likely that Ruben has been placed for Israel, as it is in Syriac, St. Fulgentius, &c. This correction is maintained by Bellarmine, Salien, Menochius. (Calmet) --- Thus both Judith and her husband were of the same tribe, the former by Salathiel, the latter by Sarisadai. (Calmet) --- Innumerable are the mistakes in the proper names, in Scripture. (Haydock) --- Some of these might have had more than one. Greek has Sarasdai, (Complutensian, "Saladai;" Alexandrian Septuagint, "Salasadai.") instead of Simeon, son of Israel: (Calmet) Alexandrian Septuagint, "<i>Jeel,</i>" which is probably a contraction for Israel. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - 'JDT:8:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Who.</i> Greek adds, "of her tribe and family, and he died in the days," &c.'
      v:003:
        - 'JDT:8:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Died.</i> Greek, "fell upon his couch; (Grabe adds, "and died in Betuloua, his own city,") and they buried him with his fathers, in the field between Dothaim and Balamo." (Haydock) --- These places seem to be added without reason, as they were too remote from Bethulia. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - 'JDT:8:4 | 4 | 4-5 | <i>Six.</i> So the old Vulgate, Greek, and Syriac have, four months. --- <i>Private.</i> Greek, "a tent on the roof," that she might look towards Jerusalem, and pray with less distraction. Absalom lay in such a situation, 2 Kings xvi. 22. (Calmet) --- <i>In which.</i> Greek, "and she put sackcloth," &c., ver. 6. (Haydock) --- It was a rough sort of garment. (Calmet) --- Judith led a most religious life, in prayer, hair-cloth, and fasting, all the year, except on the festivals. (Worthington)'
      v:006:
        - 'JDT:8:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Loins.</i> Greek, "and she had on the garments of her widowhood, and." (Haydock) --- She laid these aside, chap. x. ii. (Calmet) --- <i>Life.</i> Greek, "widowhood, except the day before the sabbath, and the sabbaths, and the new moons, and feasts, and days of rejoicing of the house of Israel." (Haydock) --- Syriac and old Vulgate omit, "the day before the sabbath;" and perhaps it may not have been in the original, the Greek translator having inserted it conformably to the practice of his times. It was then prescribed to abstain from fasting, that the joy of the festival might not be impaired, (Grotius) and because it would be necessary to taste what was made ready for the sabbath; (Skikard, Purim) or rather because, as the festival began on Friday, between the two vespers, or from three to six in the afternoon, during the equinoxes, the fast could not be rigorously observed on Friday. (Calmet) --- <i>New moons</i> were days of rejoicing. (Menochius) (1 Kings xx. 5.) --- The Jews kept two days together, for fear of missing the day on which the moon really appeared. Several feasts were also prescribed perhaps before this time, on the 1st and 22nd of Nisan, &c.'
      v:007:
        - 'JDT:8:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Of oxen.</i> Greek, Syriac, &c., add, "and fields, and she lived on them."'
      v:008:
        - 'JDT:8:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Her.</i> "The reputation of chastity in women is tender, and, like a beautiful flower, presently withers at the least blast, and perishes; particularly when they are at an age prone to vice, and destitute of the authority of a husband, whose shadow is the safeguard to a wife." (St. Jerome ad Salvinam.) --- The Scripture could not give Judith a greater character. (Calmet) --- How few can obtain it at present, though their virtue may be most pure, detraction is so keen! (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'JDT:8:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>When.</i> Greek and Syriac, "and she heard of the evil discourses of the populace against the magistrate, as they lost courage on account of the scarcity of water; and Judith heard of all the words of Ozias to them, how he had sworn to them that he would deliver up the city to the Assyrians after five days. Then sending her maid, whom she had placed at the head of all her possessions, she called Ozias," &c. The following verses give the same sense as the Vulgate, though in other words, and with some additional circumstances. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - 'JDT:8:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Pleasure.</i> She blames the magistrates for taking a rash oath, pretending to fathom the designs of God, and to fix a time for him, and not attempting to make any resistance, though the welfare of the whole nation, and the sacred things, depended on their exertions. (Calmet) --- They had been assured that God had heard their prayer, (chap. iv. 9.) and had often witnessed a miraculous interference of Providence. In other circumstances (Haydock) the magistrates would not have been to blame, though Judith might think them so; (Serarius. See ver. 26.; Menochius) and, in effect, they ought rather to have died than thus to have exposed all to certain ruin. (Worthington)'
      v:015:
        - 'JDT:8:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Man.</i> Greek, "But do not you govern the designs of the Lord, our God, for God is not to be menaced like man, nor forced to give an account like the son of man." (Haydock) (Numbers xxiii. 19.)'
      v:018:
        - 'JDT:8:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>For.</i> Greek, "As there has not arisen in our <i>families</i> generations, nor is there at this day either tribe, or family, or populace, or city among us, adoring gods made with hands, as it happened in days past;" in the former part of the reign of Manasses. All had begun to open their eyes, at the sight of the dreadful catastrophe. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'JDT:8:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Let.</i> Greek, "Wherefore we hope that he will not despise us, nor <i>those</i> of our race; nor, if we be taken, will Judea be so styled, our sacred things will be plundered. He will require his profanation at our mouth," &c. She shews the dread consequences which will ensue from the rash oath, and from such dastardly conduct under trial. (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - 'JDT:8:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Brethren.</i> Greek adds, "Let us shew our brethren that their soul depends on us, and the holy things, and the house, (temple) and the altar, are supported by us." These were not therefore demolished, chap. v. 22. (Haydock) --- "Yea, let us give thanks, above all, to the Lord our God, who tries us like our fathers. Remember," &c.'
      v:023:
        - 'JDT:8:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Jacob.</i> Greek adds, "in Mesopotamia....because he does not take vengeance on us, as he made them pass through fire to examine their heart. But the Lord, for an admonition, chastises those who approach to him. And Ozias," ver. 28. (Haydock)'
      v:025:
        - 'JDT:8:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Destroyer.</i> As this word is not used elsewhere, (Worthington) St. Paul seems to allude to this passage, (1 Corinthians x. 10.) as Judith does to various punishments (Numbers xi. 1., and xiv. 12., and xx. 4.; Calmet) inflicted by an angel. (Menochius)'
      v:026:
        - 'JDT:8:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Suffer,</i> as if to shew our impatience (Haydock) and anger against God. (Menochius)'
      v:028:
        - 'JDT:8:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Words.</i> Greek adds, "for it is not to-day <i>only</i> that thy wisdom has appeared, but from thy earliest days all the people has known thy prudence, as the formation (Haydock. Syriac, the thought; Calmet) of thy heart is good. But the people was much oppressed with thirst, and they forced us to....take an oath, which we shall not break. Now," &c. (Haydock) --- It hence appears that Judith was not very young; and as many desired to marry her, (chap. ultra; Greek) we may conclude that she was of a middle age, or about thirty-five. (Houbigant)'
      v:029:
        - 'JDT:8:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>God.</i> Greek adds, "and the Lord will send rain to fill our reservoirs, and we shall faint no longer. And Judith replied: Hear me, and I will perform an action which shall come to the ears of all future generations of our race. You," &c., ver. 32. (Haydock) --- She did not tell what she was going to do. (Calmet)'
      v:032:
        - 'JDT:8:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Servant.</i> Greek {GREEK:START abra}αβρα{GREEK:END}, commonly (Haydock) denotes a maid of honour, (Worthington) or companion, though sometimes it is applied to people of loose morals. This servant had probably the administration of the affairs of her mistress, ver. 9. (Calmet) --- <i>Pray.</i> Greek, "as you....the Lord will by my hand look," &c.'
      v:033:

      v:001: 'JDT:8:1 | 1 | 1 | Now it came to pass, when Judith, a widow, had heard these words, who was the daughter of Merari, the son of Idox, the son of Joseph, the son of Ozias, the son of Elai, the son of Jamnor, the son of Gedeon, the son of Raphaim, the son of Achitob, the son of Melchias, the son of Enan, the son of Nathanias, the son of Salathiel, the son of Simeon, the son of Ruben:'
      v:002: 'JDT:8:2 | 2 | 2 | And her husband was Manasses, who died in the time of the barley-harvest:'
      v:003: 'JDT:8:3 | 3 | 3 | For he was standing over them that bound sheaves in the field; and the heat came upon his head, and he died in Bethulia, his own city, and was buried there with his fathers.'
      v:004: 'JDT:8:4 | 4 | 4 | And Judith, his relict, was a widow now three years and six months.'
      v:005: 'JDT:8:5 | 5 | 5 | And she made herself a private chamber in the upper part of her house, in which she abode, shut up with her maids.'
      v:006: 'JDT:8:6 | 6 | 6 | And she wore hair-cloth upon her loins, and fasted all the days of her life, except the sabbaths, and new moons, and the feasts of the house of Israel.'
      v:007: 'JDT:8:7 | 7 | 7 | And she was exceedingly beautiful, and her husband left her great riches, and very many servants, and large possessions of herds of oxen, and flocks of sheep.'
      v:008: 'JDT:8:8 | 8 | 8 | And she was greatly renowned among all, because she feared the Lord very much, neither was there any one that spoke an ill word of her.'
      v:009: 'JDT:8:9 | 9 | 9 | When, therefore, she had heard that Ozias had promised that he would deliver up the city after the fifth day, she sent to the ancients, Chabri and Charmi.'
      v:010: 'JDT:8:10 | 10 | 10 | And they came to her, and she said to them: What is this word, by which Ozias hath consented to give up the city to the Assyrians, if within five days there come no aid to us?'
      v:011: JDT:8:11 | 11 | 11 | And who are you that tempt the Lord?
      v:012: 'JDT:8:12 | 12 | 12 | This is not a word that may draw down mercy, but rather that may stir up wrath, and enkindle indignation.'
      v:013: 'JDT:8:13 | 13 | 13 | You have set a time for the mercy of the Lord, and you have appointed him a day, according to your pleasure.'
      v:014: 'JDT:8:14 | 14 | 14 | But for as much as the Lord is patient, let us be penitent for this same thing, and with many tears let us beg his pardon:'
      v:015: 'JDT:8:15 | 15 | 15 | For God will not threaten like man, nor be inflamed to anger like the son of man.'
      v:016: 'JDT:8:16 | 16 | 16 | And therefore, let us humble our souls before him, and continuing in an humble spirit, in his service:'
      v:017: 'JDT:8:17 | 17 | 17 | Let us ask the Lord with tears, that according to his will so he would shew his mercy to us: that as our heart is troubled by their pride, so also we may glory in our humility:'
      v:018: 'JDT:8:18 | 18 | 18 | For we have not followed the sins of our fathers, who forsook their God, and worshipped strange gods.'
      v:019: 'JDT:8:19 | 19 | 19 | For which crime, they were given up to their enemies, to the sword, and to pillage, and to confusion: but we know no other God but him.'
      v:020: 'JDT:8:20 | 20 | 20 | Let us humbly wait for his consolation, and the Lord, our God, will require our blood of the afflictions of our enemies, and he will humble all the nations that shall rise up against us, and bring them to disgrace.'
      v:021: 'JDT:8:21 | 21 | 21 | And now, brethren, as you are the ancients among the people of God, and their very soul resteth upon you: comfort their hearts by your speech, that they may be mindful how our fathers were tempted, that they might be proved, whether they worshipped their God truly.'
      v:022: 'JDT:8:22 | 22 | 22 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}They must remember how our father, Abraham, was tempted, and being proved by many tribulations, was made the friend of God.'
      v:023: 'JDT:8:23 | 23 | 23 | So Isaac, so Jacob, so Moses, and all that have pleased God, passed through many tribulations, remaining faithful.'
      v:024: 'JDT:8:24 | 24 | 24 | But they that did not receive the trials with the fear of the Lord, but uttered their impatience and the reproach of their murmuring, against the Lord,'
      v:025: 'JDT:8:25 | 25 | 25 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Were destroyed by the destroyer, and perished by serpents.'
      v:026: 'JDT:8:26 | 26 | 26 | As for us, therefore, let us not revenge ourselves for these things which we suffer,'
      v:027: 'JDT:8:27 | 27 | 27 | But esteeming these very punishments to be less than our sins deserve, let us believe that these scourges of the Lord, with which, like servants, we are chastised, have happened for our amendment, and not for our destruction.'
      v:028: 'JDT:8:28 | 28 | 28 | And Ozias, and the ancients, said to her: All things which thou hast spoken are true, and there is nothing to be reprehended in thy words.'
      v:029: 'JDT:8:29 | 29 | 29 | Now therefore pray for us, for thou art a holy woman, and one fearing God.'
      v:030: 'JDT:8:30 | 30 | 30 | And Judith said to them: As you know that what I have been able to say, is of God:'
      v:031: 'JDT:8:31 | 31 | 31 | So that which I intend to do, prove ye if it be of God, and pray that God may strengthen my design.'
      v:032: 'JDT:8:32 | 32 | 32 | You shall stand at the gate this night, and I will go out with my maid-servant: and pray ye, that as you have said, in five days the Lord may look down upon his people, Israel.'
      v:033: 'JDT:8:33 | 33 | 33 | But I desire that you search not into what I am doing; and till I bring you word, let nothing else be done but to pray for me to the Lord, our God.'
      v:034: 'JDT:8:34 | 34 | 34 | And Ozias, the prince of Juda, said to her: Go in peace, and the Lord be with thee, to take revenge of our enemies. So, returning, they departed.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JDT:9:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Oratory.</i> Of such our Saviour speaks, Matthew vi.; and Baronius at large. (The year of our Lord 293.) (Worthington) --- Greek, "But Judith fell prostrate, and sprinkled ashes upon her head, (Syriac adds, and tore her tunic) and uncovered the sackcloth which she had on. That evening the incense had just been offered, in the house of the Lord, at Jerusalem. And Judith cried aloud," &c.'
      v:002:
        - 'JDT:9:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Gavest him a sword,</i> &c. The justice of God is here praised, in punishing by the sword of Simeon the crime of the Sichemites: and not the fact of Simeon, which was justly condemned by his father, Genesis xlix. 5. Though even with regard to this fact, we may distinguish between his zeal against the crime committed by the ravishers of his sister, which zeal may be considered just: and the manner of his punishing that crime, which was irregular and excessive. (Challoner) --- The former is here commended. (Worthington) (Menochius) --- Yet Simeon was not blameless. God put the sword into his hand as he makes use of tyrants; in which sense Nabuchodonosor is styled his <i>servant,</i> Jeremias xxv. 9., Ezechiel xxix. 18., and Genesis xxxiv. 2, 25.'
      v:003:
        - 'JDT:9:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>And.</i> Greek, "For thou didst say: It shall not be so: and they did it because thou hadst given their princes unto slaughter, and their bed, which had perceived their deceit, unto blood; and thou didst slay the slaves with the princes, and the princes on their thrones; and thou gavest," &c. (Haydock) --- This style seems rather poetical. (Grotius) (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - 'JDT:9:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Of old.</i> Greek, "before these, and these, and what followed, and is at present, and things to come, thou hast foreseen." All events depend on Thee. "For the things which thou hadst decreed were at hand, and said: Behold, we are here." (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - 'JDT:9:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Judgments.</i> All is foreseen: nothing can resist the decrees of God. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'JDT:9:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>As.</i> Greek speaks not of the Egyptians: "For behold the Assyrians are multiplied in their power, and exalted on account of their cavalry; they have boasted on the strong arm of the infantry, have trusted in their shield, and bow, and sling; and they have not known that thou art the Lord, making an end of wars: Thy name is Lord; break their force, by thy power," &c., ver. 11. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - 'JDT:9:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Them,</i> as they were not able to come to action during the night, Exodus xiv.'
      v:013:
        - 'JDT:9:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Lips,</i> or with my endearing speeches. (Menochius) --- She meant innocently to engage the affections of Holofernes, (Haydock) and prays that he may receive her in that manner, as he might have done without sin. But when he abused his free-will, God turned his sin to the good of others. See Exodus vii. (St. Augustine, ser. 288.) (Worthington) --- Greek, "Give that power which I have devised to the hand of me, a widow. Strike the slave by the lips of my delusion, (or by my ensnaring words) with the prince; and the chief, with his minister, break their haughtiness by the hand of a female, ver. 15. (Haydock) --- This prayer seems contrary to sound morality, as well as the indiscreet conduct of Judith, in exposing herself to danger, though her intention was good. (Calmet) --- But are not stratagems lawful in war? See 2 Kings xv. Is it sinful for a woman to endeavour to captivate the heart? The situation might be dangerous, but it was not criminal; and Judith was certainly determined to yield to no dishonest proposals. God therefore approved of her designs, and enhanced her beauty, chap. x. 4. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - 'JDT:9:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Horses.</i> Greek, "the potent, but thou art the Lord of the humble."'
      v:017:
        - 'JDT:9:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>And.</i> Greek, "give my word and deceit to be a wound and a scar to them, who, against thy covenant and sanctified house, and the summit of Sion,...have devised cruel things, and do for all thy nation according to thy power and strength; for there is no other to shield Israel but Thou."'

      v:001: 'JDT:9:1 | 1 | 1 | And when they were gone, Judith went into her oratory: and putting on hair-cloth, laid ashes on her head: and falling down prostrate before the Lord, she cried to the Lord, saying:'
      v:002: 'JDT:9:2 | 2 | 2 | O Lord God of my father Simeon, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}who gavest him a sword to execute vengeance against strangers, who had defiled by their uncleanness, and uncovered the virgin unto confusion:'

      v:005: 'JDT:9:5 | 5 | 5 | For all thy ways are prepared, and in thy providence thou hast placed thy judgments.'
      v:006: 'JDT:9:6 | 6 | 6 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Look upon the camp of the Assyrians now, as thou wast pleased to look upon the camp of the Egyptians, when they pursued armed after thy servants, trusting in their chariots, and in their horsemen, and in a multitude of warriors.'

      v:010: 'JDT:9:10 | 10 | 10 | And know not that thou art our God, who destroyest wars from the beginning, and the Lord is thy name.'
      v:011: 'JDT:9:11 | 11 | 11 | Lift up thy arm as from the beginning, and crush their power with thy power: let their power fall in thy wrath, who promise themselves to violate thy sanctuary, and defile the dwelling-place of thy name, and to beat down with their sword the horn of thy altar.'
      v:012: 'JDT:9:12 | 12 | 12 | Bring to pass, O Lord, that his pride may be cut off with his own sword.'
      v:013: 'JDT:9:13 | 13 | 13 | Let him be caught in the net of his own eyes, in my regard, and do thou strike him by the graces of the words of my lips.'

      v:016: 'JDT:9:16 | 16 | 16 | For thy power, O Lord, is not in a multitude, nor is thy pleasure in the strength of horses, nor from the beginning have the proud been acceptable to thee: but the prayer of the humble and the meek hath always pleased thee.'
      v:017: 'JDT:9:17 | 17 | 17 | O God of the heavens, creator of the waters, and Lord of the whole creation, hear me a poor wretch, making supplication to thee, and presuming of thy mercy.'

    commentary:
      v:002:
        - 'JDT:10:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>House.</i> Greek adds, "where she spent the sabbath and festival days, she rolled up her," &c. (Haydock) --- She remained in her oratory therefore only on other days. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'JDT:10:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Body.</i> Complutensian Greek, "mouth." But other editions seem more accurate. (Haydock) --- <i>Best.</i> Greek, "thick," probably the <i>myrobalanum</i> of Pliny, [Natural History?] xii. 21., and xiii. 1. --- <i>Bonnet,</i> or mitre, tied with ribbands, hanging down behind, like those of bishops. --- <i>Sandals,</i> highly ornamented, and worn by people of quality. (Calmet) --- <i>Lilies,</i> pendent from the neck. (Grotius)'
      v:004:
        - 'JDT:10:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>And.</i> Greek, "and she was richly adorned, so that she might captivate (literally, deceive) the eyes of whatever men should behold her. And," ver. 5. (Haydock) --- The fathers highly extol her virtue, and she was, no doubt, actuated by the purest motives. Yet she might be guilty of some indiscretion. Even the working of miracles would not prove the contrary, as wicked priests may confer the sacraments; and Moses was reprehensible the moment (Calmet) before (Haydock) he wrought a miracle, Numbers xx. 10., and Matthew vii. 22. God inspired her with the laudable design of freeing her country, but the means were left to her own choice. (Calmet) --- The making use of this rich attire was not, however, sinful in itself; and we have no right to suspect that Judith gave any way either to vanity or to sensuality. How many ladies of quality are dressed so as to enchant all those who are not upon their guard! Yet, provided they observe due modesty, who will blame their rich attire or perfumes? (Haydock) --- Judith might lawfully desire to marry Holofernes for the good of her nation, (Menochius) as Esther became the wife of Assuerus, though an infidel. The general seemed even willing to become a convert, chap. xi. 21. (Haydock) --- God bore witness to the holy intention of Judith in adorning herself. (Witham)'
      v:005:
        - 'JDT:10:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Bottle;</i> made of leather, (Calmet) used for carrying wine. (Pollox.) (Menochius) --- <i>Corn.</i> It was eaten either steeped in water or mixed with oil. --- <i>Cheese.</i> So the Syriac reads. Greek, "pure loaves." (Calmet) --- Why she took her provisions with her, she explains, chap. xii. 2. (Menochius)'
      v:007:
        - 'JDT:10:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Her.</i> Greek adds, "with her countenance and robes changed."'
      v:008:
        - 'JDT:10:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>But.</i> Greek, "And they said to her, May God, the God of." --- <i>With.</i> Greek, "For the glory of the Israelites, and the exaltation of Jerusalem; and they adored God. And she said to them, Order the gate of the city to be opened for me, and I will go out to accomplish what you were talking about to me. And they commanded the young men to open for her; and they did so. But Judith and her maid went out. And the citizens looked at her while she descended the hill, till she had passed the valley, when they lost sight of her; and they passed along straight through the vale, and the advanced guard of," &c. (Haydock) --- It appears that there was still day-light, (Calmet) or the moon shone brightly. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - 'JDT:10:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Because I knew,</i> &c. In this and the following chapter, some things are related to have been said by Judith, which seem hard to reconcile with truth. But all that is related in Scripture of the servants of God, is not approved by the Scripture: and even the saints in their enterprizes may sometimes slip into venial sins. (Challoner) --- By means of mental reservations, we may exculpate her from lying. (Serarius) (Menochius) --- But this expedient is bad and childish. (Haydock) --- She might speak ironically, (Denis the Carthusian) or prophetically. (Raban. Glossa, &c.) --- Still it might be an untruth, (Calmet) to be excused, like stratagems in war. (Menochius) --- How often does an enemy give out that he is going to march to some place, when he intends to go quite another way! (Haydock) --- <i>I knew.</i> Greek, "Because they are about to be given up a prey to you. Therefore, I come to Holofernes, general in chief of your army, to inform him of the truth, and to shew," &c. (Haydock) --- She spoke many things certainly true, and others which would probably have taken place, if God had not sent relief. (Worthington)'
      v:015:
        - 'JDT:10:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Lord.</i> Greek adds, "and now proceed to his tent, and some of us shall give thee into his hands. But if thou stand before him, let not thy heart fear, but tell him this, and he will treat thee well. And they selected 100 men, and surrounded her and her servant-maid, and conducted her to the tent of Holofernes. And they ran from all parts of the camp, as soon as her coming was made known, and they came round her as she stood without the tent of Holofernes, till they had told him of her. And they were astonished at her beauty, and at the Israelites, and said to each other, Who," &c., ver. 18.'
      v:018:
        - 'JDT:10:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>That we.</i> Greek, "For it is not expedient to leave one man of them alive, lest they should delude all the earth." (Old Vulgate omits the negation.) "And all who slept near Holofernes, and all his servants, came out and introduced her into the tent;" (Haydock. which was divided into two apartments. Heraclides) "and Holofernes was reposing on a bed in the canopy, (or inner room) which," &c. (Haydock) --- The curtain was intended to keep off gnats. Mark Anthony imitated this delicacy.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Interque signa (turpe!) militaria,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Sol aspicit conopæum.</i> (Horace, epod. ix.) (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - 'JDT:10:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>After.</i> Greek, "And they told him of her, and he came out to the forepart of the tent, and silver lamps preceded him, (Haydock) either for grandeur, as they did the kings of Persia and the emperors of Rome and of the Turks, or because it was still dark." (Calmet) --- "But as soon as Judith came in sight of him and of his ministers, they all were astonished at the beauty of her face; and falling prostrate, she adored him, (with civil respect) and his servants lifted her up." (Haydock) --- St. Fulgentius (ep. 2.) judges, with great probability, that Judith was now about 40 years old. (Worthington)'

      v:016: 'JDT:10:16 | 16 | 16 | And be assured of this, that when thou shalt stand before him, he will treat thee well, and thou wilt be most acceptable to his heart. And they brought her to the tent of Holofernes, telling him of her.'
      v:017: 'JDT:10:17 | 17 | 17 | And when she was come into his presence, forthwith Holofernes was caught by his eyes.'
      v:018: 'JDT:10:18 | 18 | 18 | And his officers said to him: Who can despise the people of the Hebrews, who have such beautiful women that we should not think it worth our while for their sakes to fight against them?'
      v:019: 'JDT:10:19 | 19 | 19 | And Judith, seeing Holofernes sitting under a canopy, which was woven of purple and gold, with emeralds and precious stones:'
      v:020: 'JDT:10:20 | 20 | 20 | After she had looked on his face, bowed down to him, prostrating herself to the ground. And the servants of Holofernes lifted her up, by the command of their master.'

      v:003:
        - 'JDT:11:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Why.</i> Greek, "And art come to us? For thou art come for thy own safety. Take courage, for thou shalt live this night and henceforth, as no one shall hurt thee, but shall do thee good, as the servants of my lord, Nabuchodonosor, the king, are treated."'
      v:004:
        - 'JDT:11:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Handmaid.</i> Greek adds, "and I will tell no untruth to my lord this night, for," &c. --- <i>Thing.</i> Greek adds, "and none of the projects of my lord shall fail." (Haydock) --- All that Judith said was true in her sense, though the enemy did not understand her properly. So Josue lawfully entrapped the citizens of Hai. (St. Augustine, q. 10. in Josue viii.) (Worthington)'
      v:005:
        - 'JDT:11:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Liveth.</i> She imitates Joseph, (Genesis xlii. 15.) and Eliseus; (4 Kings ii. 4.) and speaks the truth, as the general had subjected many to his master. (Menochius) --- Her speech was not superstitious, but shewed a civil respect. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'JDT:11:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>To him.</i> Greek intimates that she advised him to follow his counsel. "For our nation is not punished with the sword, unless they sin against their God. But now let not my lord be at a loss what to do. For death has fallen upon them, and sin has taken possession of them, so that they have irritated God by their folly," &c., ver. 10. This might also be true, though they had not fallen into idolatry (chap. viii. 18.; Haydock) at Bethulia. (Menochius)'
      v:008:
        - 'JDT:11:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Prophets.</i> Though this had been threatened by the ancient prophets, (Haydock) we cannot pretend to specify which she means. (Calmet)'

        - 'JDT:11:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Famine.</i> They might have provisions, but they would be useless, on account of excessive thirst. (Menochius)'

        - 'JDT:11:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Drink.</i> Greek, "and all that God had forbidden them to eat by his laws, (Haydock) without making any distinction between the clean and unclean. (Grotius) --- Blood was prohibited even before the law, Genesis ix. 4., and Leviticus xvii. 14. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'JDT:11:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Oil.</i> Greek may explain this. "And the first-fruits of corn, and the tithes of wine and of oil, which they had reserved as sacred for the priests, standing in Jerusalem, before our God, they had decreed to consume; though none of the people ought so much as to touch these things. Yet they have sent to obtain permission of the senate at Jerusalem, where the people have done the like. And when they shall have obtained an answer, they will fall to work, and then they will be abandoned to be destroyed by thee." (Haydock) --- She insinuates that her countrymen are in the utmost distress, and not much attached to religion; (Calmet) though in extreme want the distinction of meats is not to be enforced. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - 'JDT:11:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Tell.</i> Greek, "To perform with thee a feat which will astonish all who shall hear of these things. For thy handmaid is religious, and serveth the God of heaven day and night; and now my lord, I am," &c.'
      v:014:
        - 'JDT:11:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>God.</i> Greek adds, "in the night, in the valley."'
      v:015:
        - 'JDT:11:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>He will.</i> Greek, "They shall have completed their sins." --- <i>Tell thee.</i> Greek adds, "and thou shalt go out with all thy forces, and none of them shall resist thee; and I will bring thee through Judea, over-against Jerusalem, and will place thy throne in the midst of it, and thou shalt drive them like sheep," &c. --- <i>Dog.</i> This is proverbial, Exodus xi. 7. (Calmet) --- All Israel was at rest after the death of Holofernes. Judith brought his head in triumph through the country. The promise of dominion (Haydock) was ironical, 3 Kings xxii. 15. (Menochius)'
      v:016:
        - 'JDT:11:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>God.</i> Greek, "My foreknowledge; and I was sent to inform thee." (Haydock) --- She flatters Holofernes with the idea that he is under the special care of heaven. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - 'JDT:11:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>That.</i> Greek, "To increase our strength, and to bring destruction on those who have despised my lord."'

(Haydock) --- It is hardly probable that he spoke in earnest. Perhaps he did not know that the true God allowed <i>of no</i> other. Being captivated with Judith's beauty, and perceiving that she was attached to religion, he had a mind to remove all her objections to his person. (Calmet)"

      v:006: 'JDT:11:6 | 6 | 6 | For the industry of thy mind is spoken of among all nations, and it is told through the whole world, that thou only art excellent and mighty in all his kingdom, and thy discipline is cried up in all provinces.'
      v:007: 'JDT:11:7 | 7 | 7 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}It is known, also, what Achior said, nor are we ignorant of what thou hast commanded to be done to him.'
      v:008: 'JDT:11:8 | 8 | 8 | For it is certain that our God is so offended with sins, that he hath sent word by his prophets to the people, that he will deliver them up for their sins.'
      v:009: 'JDT:11:9 | 9 | 9 | And because the children of Israel know they have offended their God, thy dread is upon them.'
      v:010: 'JDT:11:10 | 10 | 10 | Moreover, also, a famine hath come upon them, and for drought of water they are already to be counted among the dead.'
      v:011: 'JDT:11:11 | 11 | 11 | And they have a design even to kill their cattle, and to drink the blood of them.'
      v:012: 'JDT:11:12 | 12 | 12 | And the consecrated things of the Lord, their God, which God forbade them to touch, in corn, wine, and oil, these have they purposed to make use of, and they design to consume the things which they ought not to touch with their hands: therefore, because they do these things, it is certain they will be given up to destruction.'
      v:013: 'JDT:11:13 | 13 | 13 | And I, thy handmaid, knowing this, am fled from them, and the Lord hath sent me to tell thee these very things.'
      v:014: 'JDT:11:14 | 14 | 14 | For I, thy handmaid, worship God even now that I am with thee, and thy handmaid will go out, and I will pray to God,'

      v:002:

        - 'JDT:12:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Thee.</i> Greek adds, "for there is none of thy race."'
      v:004:
        - 'JDT:12:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Which I.</i> Greek, "he." --- <i>Which.</i> Greek, "and she slept till midnight and she arose at the morning watch." (Haydock) --- The mode of counting by hours prevailed after the captivity. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'JDT:12:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>And.</i> Greek, "and she sent to Holofernes, saying: May my lord please to order that thy handmaid may go out to pray. And," &c., ver. 6. (Haydock) --- She had prepared him to grant this request before: but out of civility, and that he may have greater confidence in her, she asks again. The choice of a retired place for prayer is very commendable, but she made choice of the fields, that she might go out of the camp afterwards without being suspected. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'JDT:12:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Chamberlains.</i> Greek, "life-guards, not to hinder her; and she remained in the camp three days." (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - 'JDT:12:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Water.</i> Greek, "in the camp;" perhaps she washed only her hands and face. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - 'JDT:12:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Pure,</i> from forbidden food. (Worthington) --- <i>Evening.</i> Thus she continued to fast, to draw down the blessing of God. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - 'JDT:12:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Servants.</i> Greek adds, "only, and he did not call any of those whom he <i>usually</i> employed," (Haydock) that they might not witness his excesses. <i>Vagao,</i> or Bagoas, the Persian name for an "eunuch," or chief officer; though such were generally to wait on the ladies.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Quem penes est Dominam servandi cura Bagoæ.</i> (Ovid, Amor. ii.){JOIN}--- <i>Eunuch.</i> Greek and Syriac add, "who was appointed over all his affairs. Persuade the Hebrew woman who is with thee to come to us, and to eat and drink with us. For we deem it shameful to dismiss such a woman, without having commerce with her; and if we do not attract her, she will deride us."'
      v:012:
        - 'JDT:12:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Merry.</i> This would pave the way for greater liberties. (Calmet) --- Greek adds, "and to become this day as a daughter of the Assyrians, standing <i>to wait</i> in the house of Nabuchodonosor." He probably alludes to those courtezans (Calmet) who sung at night, before the palace, &c. (Athen. Dip. xii. 2.) The Persians admitted women to their feasts, though they were generally excluded in the East, Esther i. 12. (Herodotus v. 18.)'
      v:014:
        - 'JDT:12:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Best.</i> Greek, "a boast, <i>or</i> matter of exultation." (Haydock) --- This answer seems to shock our delicacy. Did she not understand the meaning of the eunuch, which was sufficiently plain? She only passed a compliment, which always implies a tacit condition, if the thing be practicable and honest: as the words might have two meanings, she was bound in charity to interpret them in the best sense. (Calmet) --- It was surely lawful to be merry. (Menochius)'
      v:015:
        - 'JDT:12:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Garments.</i> Greek adds, "and all her female ornaments; and her servant came and spread on the ground, before Holofernes, the fleeces which she had received from Bagoas, for her daily use, to eat lying upon them. And coming in, Judith fell prostrate." (Haydock) --- The custom of sitting on the ground, upon skins, to eat, is very ancient, (Targum, Esther i.) and is still observed by the Turks. The kings of Persia let none eat with them at the same table. (Heraclides; Athen. v. 10.) --- The character of drunkenness, with which this nation has been branded, seems not unfounded. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'JDT:12:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Her.</i> Greek adds, "company; and he had sought an opportunity of deluding her, from the day when he <i>first</i> beheld her." He justly, therefore, fell into the snare which he had laid.'
      v:020:
        - 'JDT:12:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Life.</i> Greek adds, "in any one day," (Haydock) at supper. (Menochius)'

Greek adds after <i>arms,</i> "and you shall appoint a leader over them, as if descending into the plain to the advanced guard of the Assyrians; but ye shall not go down. Then these seizing all their armour, will go to the camp, and awaken the leaders of the Assyrians, and they will run to the tent of Holofernes, and shall not find him. Then fear shall seize upon them, and they will flee before us. Whereupon ye, and all who inhabit the confines of Israel, shall follow after, and strew them in their paths," slain and wounded, ver. 6.

And they called Achior from the house of Ozias. But as soon as he came, and saw the head of Holofernes in the hand of one of the assembly of the people, he fell," &c., as [in] chap. xiii. 29, 30. "Blessed art thou in every tent of Juda, and in every nation. All who shall hear thy name shall be amazed. But now tell me what thou hast done during these days. And Judith, in the midst of the people, informed him of all that she had performed, since the day of her departure till the time when she was speaking. She had no sooner ended her speech, than all the people set up a loud shout of joy in their city. Then," &c. --- <i>Leaving.</i> Greek, "He believed in God greatly," or with the utmost sincerity. (Haydock) --- Hitherto Achior had only considered the Deity as the peculiar God of Israel, (Calmet) or as <i>the common gods</i> "revered by all nations;" (Virgil xii.; Servius) but not as the only supreme Being. He now becomes a proselyte, not merely, like Naaman, to adore one God; but also to observe all the rites of the Jewish religion. The latter was a matter of choice, chap. vi. 18. It is not still clear that he could enjoy the privileges of the nation as a magistrate, or even marry, (Calmet) which shews his greater fervour. (Grotius) --- It is certain that no nation could be forbidden to worship God, Deuteronomy xxiii. 3. St. Thomas Aquinas (1. 2. q. 105. a. 3.) believes that a dispensation was granted to Achior, (Calmet) so that he might be treated like an Israelite in all respects. (Serarius q. 1.) (Menochius) --- This evinces that only the impenitent Ammonites, &c., were excluded from the <i>Church.</i> (Worthington) --- <i>With.</i> Greek, "till this day."'

Holofernes assumed the like importance, and was treated almost as a deity. (Calmet) --- Hence he must not be awaked, in a rude manner.

But when the Israelites heard this, they all, unanimously, fell upon them, as far as Chobai: (Haydock; Hoba.; Calmet) in like manner those from Jerusalem came up, and from all the mountainous country; for they also were informed of what had happened in the camp of their enemies; and the men of Galaad and of Galilee scattered them with great slaughter, till they had passed Damascus and its boundaries."

(Calmet) --- <i>To see.</i> Greek adds, "the good things (Complutensian; to confirm <i>or</i> lay a foundation for, the good things) which God had done to Israel, and to see Judith, and speak peace with her." Protestants, "to salute her." (Haydock) --- Joachim is the same with Eliacim; El being only prefixed.

Be thou blessed by the omnipotent Lord for ever." (Haydock) --- Judith was a figure of the blessed Virgin [Mary], to whom these praises chiefly belong. (Fulbert.) (Worthington)'

This is not in Syriac, &c., and though, generally speaking, celibacy was not esteemed honourable among the Jews, yet chastity was so much the more admired, as it was more uncommon. A widow was deserving of praise for not lightly entering upon a second marriage. (Calmet) --- Those who abstain from it, were respected, like virgins, by the Romans. (Val. Maxim. ii. 1.)'

Then she took some thyrsus (Haydock; or branches entwined with ivy, &c.; Calmet) in her hands, and gave to those women who accompanied her; and they crowned with olive both her and her attendant; (<i>maid,</i> or Alexandrian Septuagint, "and she was crowned with olive, and her mule;" Grabe substitutes "female companions,") and she went before all the people, leading the dance of all the women; and every man of Israel followed in arms, with crowns, and with hymns in their mouth. Then," &c., chap. xvi. (Haydock) --- The bearing of green branches, on such occasions, was very common, Leviticus xxiii. 40., 2 Machabees x. 7., and Matthew xxi. 8. Hence Tacitus (Hist. v.) supposed that the Jews adored Bacchus. But there was nothing here of the immodesty, which generally attended the pagan festivals. We only find this instance of women being crowned with olive. But this tree was very proper, as it was used in rejoicings: <i>Ramo felicis olivæ;</i> (Virgil vi.) on which Servius remarks, <i>olivæ, arboris festæ.</i> At certain races in Greece, women who gained the victory, were thus crowned; (Alex. Genial v. 8.) and it was used by the Roman cavalry on the ides of July, and in ovations. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xv. 4.) --- The processions of the Church often admit of similar ornaments in honour of God, (Tirinus) and to promote piety. (Haydock)'

        - 'JDT:16:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Sung.</i> Greek, "Gave out this confession, in all Israel: and all the people echoed this praise;" (Haydock) either repeating the whole after her, or singing the first verse as a chorus, Exodus xv. 20., 1 Kings xviii. 6., and 1 Paralipomenon xvi. 8. (Calmet) --- <i>Saying.</i> Greek, "And Judith said: Begin ye to my Lord." (Haydock) --- It is time for us to break silence, and to sound forth the praises of God. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'JDT:16:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Wars,</i> or destroys armies. (Haydock) --- God is often represented as a mighty warrior, Isaias i. 24., Jeremias ii. 20., and Romans ix. 29. (Calmet) --- This passage is quoted by St. Ephrem (ser. de 2. Adv.) as a part of Scripture. (Worthington) --- <i>Lord is.</i> Greek, "For he has drawn me from the hands of my persecutors, into his camp, in the midst of the people." (Haydock)'

        - 'JDT:16:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Mountains</i> of Cilicia, and through the defiles of Libanus and Hermon, on <i>the north</i> of Palestine, by which road they were forced to come. The desert Arabia was impassable for a large army. (Calmet) --- <i>North,</i> inclining to the east. (Haydock) (Isaias xiv. 13., Jeremias i. 13., and Ezechiel i. 4.) --- <i>Torrents,</i> drinking them up, as Sennacherib boasted; (4 Kings xix. 24.) and the Greeks assert the same of the army of Xerxes. (Herodotus vii. 108.){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>-----Epotaque flumina Medo</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Prandente.-----</i> (Juvenal x.){JOIN}The Greek seems to insinuate that the Assyrians "stopped up the springs," to distress the country, as Philopator did.

The Greek translator of this work seems to have read the poets, who pretend that the Titans attempted to take heaven by storm. (Calmet) --- Neither such giants as those who lived before the flood, (Genesis vi.) nor such as were seen after, (Numbers xiii.; Worthington) attacked Holofernes. (Haydock) --- Neither does the Vulgate give any authority to poetic fictions, but only adopts terms which are best understood. (Tirinus) (St. Jerome in Amos v. 8.)'

(Calmet) --- <i>Deceived him;</i> as he would make love to her, and thus give her an opportunity to perform what she had designed.

      v:011:
        - 'JDT:16:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Sandals.</i> The bandages which tied the shoe-soles (Haydock) to the feet, were most ornamental, Isaias iii.

      v:012:
        - 'JDT:16:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Medes.</i> This is the first mention of these two nations, who afterwards became so famous. Nabuchodonosor had overcome Phraortes, chap. i. (Calmet)'

        - 'JDT:16:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Then.</i> Greek, "Than my lowly ones (Haydock; she speaks thus contemptuously of the Assyrians.; Calmet) howled, my weak ones cried out through fear; they raised their voice, and were overthrown." (Haydock) --- Others think that she is speaking of her fellow-citizens, (Tirinus) or both. (Haydock)'
      v:014:

      v:019:
        - 'JDT:16:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Great.</i> Greek, "treated mercifully by thee: for little with thee is all sacrifice, for the odour of sweetness; and all fat is <i>but</i> the least for thy holocausts. But he who fears the Lord, is ever great." (Haydock) --- This text is remarkable, as it shews (Calmet) that no sacrifice can please God, without interior holiness. Outward magnificence will be otherwise rejected with contempt. (Worthington)'
      v:020:
        - 'JDT:16:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>He will visit them,</i> is not in Greek, and only expresses the same again. (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - "JDT:16:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Flesh,</i> which is thus punished for ever, (St. Augustine, City of God xxv. 4.) while the soul is still more tormented with the loss of God's vision. (Worthington) --- The bodies of those who persecute God's people, will not only be thrown out with ignominy, but the impenitent shall suffer eternal torments. These worms and fires do not cease. They are not merely figurative, but real, according to the Fathers. (Serarius, q. 1.) (Tirinus) (Essais de Mor.) --- Though the damned have not yet their bodies, they are no less affected with pain; as people who have lost a member, often seem to feel pain in it. That our soul should even now suffer, when the body is hurt, depends on God's appointment. The Jews spoke of eternal torments in similar terms, Ecclesiasticus vii. 19., Isaias lxvi. 24., and Mark ix. 45."
      v:022:
        - 'JDT:16:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>And.</i> Greek, "But as soon as they arrived at Jerusalem, they adored God; and when the people were purified, they offered their holocausts, and free gifts, and presents." (Haydock) --- They stood in need of purification, as they had shed blood, and had touched so many things of the Assyrians, which were to them unclean. (Calmet) (Numbers xxxi. 24.)'
      v:023:
        - "JDT:16:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>An anathema of oblivion.</i> That is, a gift or offering made to God, by way of an everlasting monument, to prevent the oblivion or the forgetting of so great a benefit. (Challoner) --- Yet some would read (Calmet) <i>oblationis,</i> instead of <i>oblivionis.</i> (Tirinus) --- Greek and Syriac say nothing of oblivion. The Scriptures, and pagan histories, are full of such monuments of gratitude, to perpetuate the memory of benefits received from above. (Calmet) --- Greek, \"to the Lord, all the vessels,\" <i>or</i> furniture, chap. xv. 14. (Haydock) --- Joseph called one of his sons, Manasses, because God had caused him to forget his former toils, Genesis xli. 51. (Menochius) --- Judith's husband had the same name; and this victory made her forget past sorrow. (Haydock)"
      v:024:
        - 'JDT:16:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Three.</i> Syriac, "one entire month." (Calmet) --- <i>Joy.</i> Greek, "and Judith remained with them."'
      v:025:
        - 'JDT:16:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Was made.</i> Greek, "returned also to Bethulia, and dwelt on her own possessions; and in her time, was honourable throughout all the land."'
      v:026:
        - 'JDT:16:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Chastity.</i> Greek, "many desired <i>to have</i> her, (Haydock; <i>in marriage.</i>; Worthington) but no man knew her," &c. (Haydock) --- She again practised the same mortifications which she had done before. (Suidas) (Calmet) --- <i>Husband.</i> Greek adds, "when he was removed to his people. And proceeding, (to the temple, or advancing in age) she was very great, and she grew old in her," &c. (Haydock) --- She probably went up to Jerusalem at the great festivals. (Menochius)'
      v:028:
        - "JDT:16:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Five.</i> Suidas alone reads, \"fifty.\" Some would suppose that Judith lived 105 years after her husband's death; so that she might have been in all 125 years old. But she would thus have survived the siege of Jerusalem under Nabuchodonosor; (Calmet) and the text does not require this sense. (Haydock)  See Exodus xii. 40. (Tirinus) --- <i>Free;</i> as she had been her assistant in such a glorious work. (Menochius) --- <i>Died.</i> Greek adds, \"in Bethulia; and they buried her in the cave of her husband, Manasses.\" See chap. viii. 3."
      v:029:
        - 'JDT:16:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Seven days.</i> The usual term; (Ecclesiasticus xxii. 13.) but it was extra ordinary for the whole province (Calmet) to mourn for an individual. Greek and Syriac add, "And she divided all her possessions, before her death, among the nearest relations of her husband, Manasses, and among her own," (Haydock) which was very equitable, as she had no children, (Calmet) we may suppose. (Tirinus) (Haydock)'
      v:030:
        - 'JDT:16:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Years.</i> Greek, "days." See the preface. (Haydock) --- Judith was a widow near seventy years, shewing an excellent pattern to all in that state. Notwithstanding the many inducements which she might have had to marry again, she chose to abstain, for greater perfection, Matthew xix., and 1 Corinthians vii. (Worthington) --- From the death of Holofernes (the year of the world 3348) to that of Josias, (the year 3394) only forty-six years of peace would occur in Juda. Hence Hardouin would suppose that the text speaks of the kingdom of <i>Israel.</i> But it would be hard to prove that it existed at that time, after the ten tribes had been led away. (The year 3283.) As the Scripture does not specify how old Judith was when she addressed Holofernes, (Calmet) she might be sixty-five. (Vitre.) --- If, therefore, we should make this peace last till the coming of Nabuchodonosor, to attack Jerusalem, about forty-six years might elapse before the period here assigned. (Calmet) --- It is, however, much more probable, (Haydock) that the peace subsisted from the 11th of Manasses to the death of Josias, 73 (Greek, 78) years; (Tirinus) and that she was not above forty when she performed her exploit; as she was then styled a beautiful girl, (chap. xii. 12.) and many desired to marry her. (Haydock) --- No instance can be produced, of the Jews entering into such contracts with those who were past child-bearing. Freret, who seems afraid to allow this book the same authority as the additions to Daniel, though both are equally rejected by Protestants, supposes that Bethulia was besieged in the 11th or 12th year of Josias; and, of course, that Judith would then be about eighty-four years old! (Houbigant)'
      v:031:
        - "JDT:16:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>But.</i> This is taken from the Chaldean of St. Jerome, though omitted in the old Vulgate, as well as in the Greek and Syriac. We find no express mention of this festival in the Jews' Calendar, (Calmet) though no one can doubt but it once was kept. (Du Hamel) --- It probably ceased during the captivity; as that, in memory of the victory over Nicanor, (which was kept in the days of Josephus, [Antiquities?] xii. 16.) has been long since abolished, (Calmet) with many others. (Du Hamel) --- Many suppose (Calmet) that the feast of Judith concurred with that of the new fire, when the temple was renewed under Judas the Machabee, on the 25th of Casleu, (Salien, &c.) in December, though the victory of Judith was obtained about August. The point is not easily decided. As the festival was of human institution, it might be abrogated by the same authority. (Calmet) --- In Judith we behold a <i>widow indeed,</i> such as the apostle commends, 1 Timothy v. 3. (St. Jerome ad Furiam.) --- We may also raise our minds still higher, and contemplate in her a glorious figure of the Christian Church, which is spotless; and by the practice of all virtues, overcomes the power of persecutors, giving all the glory to God. After victory, she continues in silence to practise her former austerities, which render her secure in peace and terrible in war. (Calmet)"

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "The sacred writer of this Book is generally believed to be the high priest Eliachim, (called also Joachim.) The transactions herein related, most probably happened in his days, and in the reign of Manasses, after his repentance and return from captivity. It takes its name from that illustrious woman, by whose virtue and fortitude, armed with prayer, the children of Israel were preserved from the destruction threatened them by Holofernes and his great army. It finishes with her canticle of thanksgiving to God. (Challoner) --- He was a chief officer at court, under Ezechias, (4 Kings xviii. 18.; Haydock) before he was high priest, assuming his father Helchias's name. Many suppose that he was the author of this Book, as Josephus informs us that the priests recorded the most remarkable transactions. But this would prove that they wrote all the histories of the Bible. St. Jerome (in Aggeus i. 6.) seems to believe that Judith left these memoirs. Yet we have no certain proof of the author. Josephus passes over this history, as he professed to exhibit only the Hebrew books. (Antiquities x. 11.; Prol. &c.) St. Jerome doubts not but this was written in Chaldean, from which language he translated it; unless he caused it to be first explained to him in Hebrew as he did the Book of Tobias. (Calmet) --- He might, however, have attained sufficient knowledge of the former language, which is so like the Hebrew, before he undertook this work. (Haydock) --- He professes to give \"the sense,\" rather than a verbal translation. The Greek must have been taken from another copy, and is followed by the Syriac, in which we find some passages more exact than in the present Greek copies. The original is entirely lost. It might have removed many difficulties. Those however which are started by our adversaries, are not unanswerable. Grotius would suppose that this work is only a parable, representing the state of the Jewish church under the persecution of Epiphanes. But this singular notion has no foundation; and if it had, the authenticity of the Book would not be endangered, as the parables both of the Old and New Testament are certainly true, and written by inspiration. (Calmet) --- Luther styles it a poetical comedy; (Pref. et Sympos. 29.) but both Jews and Christians have esteemed it a true history: (Worthington) and this innovator (Haydock) allows, that \"the Book is beautiful, and written by an inspired prophet.\" (Calmet) --- The Fathers have looked upon it with the utmost veneration; and St. Jerome, though he was at one time under some doubts, placed it on a level with the Books of Ruth, and Esther, &c. (Ep. ad Principiam.) --- It is admitted by Origen, Tertullian, St. Chrysostom, St. Hilary, Ven. Bede, &c., as the history of a most valiant matron, delivering God's people from a cruel tyrant. (Worthington) --- Some place this event under Cambyses, son of Cyrus; (Eusebius; St. Augustine) others under Xerxes, (Torniel) or Darius Hystaspes, (Estius) or Ochus: (Sulp. Severus) but the opinion which has been given above is more accurate; (Calmet) or rather Bethulia was saved, while Manasses was in captivity, (in the 10th year of his reign) and the high priest administered affairs in his absence. At this point, Judith might be thirty-five years old. She lived seventy years afterwards; and <i>many</i> days (perhaps eight <i>years</i> more) passed before the country was invaded by Pharao Nechao, chap. xvi. 30. Thus Manasses survived 45 years, Amon 2, Josias 31; total 78. This chronology removes every difficulty. (Houbigant, Pref.) --- If true, it seems probable that the work would be originally in Hebrew, as the Chaldean was used only after the captivity, (Haydock) which may be farther proved from chap. i. 15. (Greek) (Houbigant) --- Protestants prefer to translate this and the other apocrypha from the Greek. (Menochius) "
