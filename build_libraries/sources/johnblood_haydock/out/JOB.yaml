    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JOB:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Hus.</i> The land of Hus was a part of Edom; as appears from Lamentations iv. 21. --- <i>Simple.</i> That is, innocent, sincere, and without guile, (Challoner) in opposition to hypocrites and double dealers. (Calmet) --- Hebrew <i>Tam,</i> "perfect."'
      v:003:
        - 'JOB:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Sheep.</i> Hebrew including "goats," which are equally valuable in that country for milk. --- <i>Camels.</i> These animals were used for riding in those barren sands, where they can travel for four days without water; and that which is muddy is best for them. --- <i>East,</i> in the desert Arabia. Septuagint add at the end of the book, that Job was king; and he seems to have been independent, (Calmet) and to have had other kings who acknowledged his authority. (Pineda) (Chap. xxix. 7., &c.) --- Each city had its own king in the days of Abraham and of Josue. Job, or Jobab, resided at Denaba, Genesis xxxvi. 32. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - 'JOB:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>His day</i> of the week in succession; (Pineda) or each on his birthday, (Genesis xl. 20., and Matthew xiv. 6.; Grotius) or once a month, &c. The daughters of Job were probably unmarried.'
      v:005:
        - 'JOB:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Blessed.</i> For greater horror of the very thought of blasphemy, the Scripture both here and [in] ver. 11, and in the following chapter (ver. 5., and 9.) uses the word <i>bless,</i> to signify its contrary. (Challoner) (3 Kings xxi. 10.) --- Thus the Greeks styled the furies <i>Eumenides,</i> "the kind," out of a horror of their real name. Even those who are the best inclined, can hardly speak of God without some want of respect, (Calmet) in the midst of feasts, where the neglect of saying grace is also too common. (Haydock) --- Septuagint, "they have thought evil against God." Every kind of offence may be included, to which feasting leads. (Menochius)'
      v:006:
        - "JOB:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>The sons of God.</i> The angels, (Challoner) as the Septuagint express it. (Calmet) --- <i>Satan also,</i> &c. This passage represents to us in a figure, accommodated to the ways and understandings of men, <b>1.</b> The restless endeavours of satan against the servants of God. <b>2.</b> That he can do nothing without God's permission. <b>3.</b> That God doth not permit him to tempt them above their strength: but assists them by his divine grace in such manner, that the vain efforts of the enemy only serve to illustrate their virtue and increase their merit. (Challoner) --- A similar prosopopeia occurs, 3 Kings xxii. 19., and Zacharias i. 10. (Calmet) --- Devils appear not in God's sight, but sometimes in presence of angels, who represent God. (St. Athanasius, q. 8. ad Antioc, (Worthington) or some ancient author.) --- The good angels can make known their orders to them, Zacharias iii. 1., and Jude 9. Both good and bad spirits may be considered as the ministers of God. (Calmet) --- They appear in judgment; though the latter could not see the Lord."
      v:009:
        - 'JOB:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>In vain,</i> without recompense. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'JOB:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Face,</i> like a hypocrite, (Sanctius) or rather curse thee openly, ver. 5. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - 'JOB:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Hand.</i> God permits evils. (Worthington) --- The devil can do nothing without leave. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - 'JOB:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Sabeans,</i> descended from Abraham, in the desert (Calmet) or happy Arabia. These nations lived on plunder. (Pliny, [Natural History?] vi. 28.) (Menochius)'
      v:016:
        - 'JOB:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Heaven,</i> or the air, where the devils exercise a power, Ephesians ii. 2.'
      v:017:
        - 'JOB:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Chaldeans.</i> Some copies of the Septuagint read "horsemen." These nations inhabited the other side of the Euphrates, but made frequent incursions to plunder their neighbours. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - 'JOB:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Head.</i> Hebrew, torn his hair, and rolled in the dust. (Bochart) (Isaias xv. 2., &c.) (Calmet) --- The fathers oppose this example to the apathy of the stoics. (St. Augustine, City of God i. 9.) (Romans i. 31.)'
      v:021:
        - 'JOB:1:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Thither.</i> To that earth from which all are taken. (Haydock) --- <i>Ista terra gentes omnes peperit & resumet demum.</i> (Varro.) --- <i>Ut mater operiens.</i> (Pliny, [Natural History?] ii. 63.) See 1 Timothy vi. 7. --- <i>As....done.</i> Some copies of St. Jerome omit this, which is borrowed from the Septuagint. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - 'JOB:1:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>By his lips,</i> is not in Hebrew but occurs [in] chap. ii. 10. --- <i>God.</i> Much less did he blaspheme, as satan had said, ver. 11. He did not consider all as the effect of chance, or like a mere philosopher. His thoughts were regulated by religion and the fear of God. (Calmet) --- The virtue of Job was so much the more wonderful, as he lived among the wicked. (St. Gregory) He bore patiently with the loss of all things: and English Catholics have often imitated him. (Worthington) --- He might well record his own good actions, the gifts of God, being moved by divine inspiration, like Moses, &c. (St. Gregory)'

    verses:
      v:001: 'JOB:1:1 | 1 | 1 | There {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job, and that man was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.'
      v:002: JOB:1:2 | 2 | 2 | And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
      v:003: 'JOB:1:3 | 3 | 3 | And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a family exceedingly great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.'
      v:004: 'JOB:1:4 | 4 | 4 | And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his day. And sending, they called their three sisters, to eat and drink with them.'
      v:005: 'JOB:1:5 | 5 | 5 | And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early, offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all days.'
      v:006: 'JOB:1:6 | 6 | 6 | Now on a certain day, when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord, satan also was present among them.'
      v:007: 'JOB:1:7 | 7 | 7 | And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.'
      v:008: 'JOB:1:8 | 8 | 8 | And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?'
      v:009: 'JOB:1:9 | 9 | 9 | And satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain?'
      v:010: 'JOB:1:10 | 10 | 10 | Hast not thou made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?'
      v:011: 'JOB:1:11 | 11 | 11 | But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he bless thee not to thy face.'
      v:012: 'JOB:1:12 | 12 | 12 | Then the Lord said to satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.'
      v:013: 'JOB:1:13 | 13 | 13 | Now upon a certain day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine, in the house of their eldest brother,'
      v:014: 'JOB:1:14 | 14 | 14 | There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,'
      v:015: 'JOB:1:15 | 15 | 15 | And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.'
      v:016: 'JOB:1:16 | 16 | 16 | And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.'
      v:017: 'JOB:1:17 | 17 | 17 | And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them; moreover, they have slain the servants with the sword: and I alone have escaped to tell thee.'
      v:018: 'JOB:1:18 | 18 | 18 | He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,'
      v:019: 'JOB:1:19 | 19 | 19 | A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children, and they are dead: and I alone have escaped to tell thee.'
      v:020: 'JOB:1:20 | 20 | 20 | Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head, fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,'
      v:021: "JOB:1:21 | 21 | 21 | And said: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord."
      v:022: 'JOB:1:22 | 22 | 22 | In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JOB:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Day.</i> Job had been under trial for some time, perhaps a year. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'JOB:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Through it.</i> Seeking whom he might devour, 1 Peter v. 8. (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - 'JOB:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Simple.</i> Plain-dealing, mild, and without guile. (St. Gregory) (Worthington) --- <i>Without cause.</i> This may form a new sentence. (Haydock) --- Thy proposal and attempts are vain. (Calmet) --- Job has not deserved this treatment. (St. Chrysostom, &c.)'
      v:004:
        - 'JOB:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Skin:</i> a proverbial expression, denoting that a man will part with any thing sooner than his life, (Calmet) or health. (Haydock) --- Satan hints, that if those inestimable blessings should be endangered, (Calmet) Job would shew his real sentiments. (Haydock) --- Skin was formerly used instead of money, at Sparta. (Senec. Ben. v. 14., &c.) Yet perhaps not in the time of Job.'
      v:006:
        - 'JOB:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Life.</i> Afflict him with any species of illness; but do not kill him, (Calmet) nor inspire him directly with wicked thoughts. (Grotius)'
      v:007:
        - 'JOB:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Ulcer;</i> the leprosy: and even with that species which is called the venereal disease, which may be contracted without any crime. Job was afflicted with a complication of the most painful and disgraceful disorders. (Pineda) (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - 'JOB:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Potsherd.</i> His nails were worn, and poverty had left him nothing else. --- <i>Dunghill.</i> Hebrew, "ashes." (Haydock) --- St. Chrysostom represents this place as visited by pilgrims, instructive and more brilliant than any throne. (Hom. 5. ad Pop. Ant.) -- Septuagint add, "upon the dung, without the city: and after a long time had elapsed, his wife also said to him, How long wilt thou wait, saying: Lo, I will still tarry a little while, expecting the hope of my salvation? For behold thy memory is perished from the land, thy sons and daughters, the pains and labours of my womb, whom I brought forth in labour and sorrow, to no purpose. But thou sittest in the open air, the night long, amid the corruption of worms, while I wander <i>like</i> a slave, seeking for one place and house after another, in expectation of the sun setting, that my labours may cease, and the sorrows which now surround and hold me fast. But speak thou some word to (or against) the Lord, and die." (Haydock) --- This addition has been omitted in the Complutensian edition, to make it like the Vulgate, (Calmet) though it is found in all the Greek copies (Nobilius) and fathers, and also in several Latin Bibles. It seems, however, to be only a gloss of some transcriber. The devil had not destroyed this wife, as she would prove one of his most powerful auxiliaries. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - 'JOB:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Bless.</i> She speaks with cruel irony. (Calmet) --- Curse God, that he may take away (St. Basil) thy miserable life; or, after taking this revenge on such unjust treatment, put an end to thy own existence. Beza and Amama excuse this woman, though condemned by Job. They pretend that she only meant to insinuate, like the rest of his friends, that he must be guilty of some grievous crime, which she urges him to confess, giving glory to God, before it be too late. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - 'JOB:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Foolish.</i> The same word often means impious, (chap. i. 22.) and ignorant, (Haydock) or "delirous." (Aquila) (Psalm xiii. 1.) --- <i>Lips.</i> The Jews assert, without reason, that he was guilty in his heart. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'JOB:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Heaven.</i> This denoted mourning or indignation, Josue vii. 6., and Acts xxii. 23.'
      v:013:
        - "JOB:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Seven days,</i> &c. They sat with him for a good part of the day, and of the night, during seven days: and spoke nothing all that time that could give him any uneasiness. (Challoner) (Menochius) (Olympiad.) --- They mourned for him as if he had been dead. Their mutual grief was too great for utterance. But the text seems to intimate that they remained with Job, all this time. (Scultet.) (Calmet) --- Their design in coming was really to afford him consolation; but being under a mistake, respecting the conduct of Providence towards mankind, (Calmet) they erred involuntarily, (Tirinus) and by attempting to prove their assertions, as if none but criminals could be so grievously afflicted, they eventually <i>insulted</i> the holy man, Tobias ii. 15. --- They argued on the principle, \"that under a just God no one is miserable, unless he have deserved it;\" not reflecting that God sometimes puts his best servants to the trial, that their merit and glory may increase. Notwithstanding their piety and learning, they became therefore the devil's most powerful agents unawares: (Calmet) and though they were not properly heretics, as they acquiesced when better informed, they were a figure of them, by drawing from many undeniable truths false inferences, and by a parade of learning, and of <i>new things.</i> (St. Gregory, Mor. iii. 24., and v. 18.) --- They also judged rashly of Job's secret behaviour. (Worthington)"

But thou hast moved me against him, that I should afflict him without cause.'

      v:010: 'JOB:2:10 | 10 | 10 | And he said to her: Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women: If we have received good things at the hand of God, why should we not receive evil? In all these things Job did not sin with his lips.'
      v:011: "JOB:2:11 | 11 | 11 | Now when Job's three friends heard all the evil that had befallen him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz, the Themanite, and Baldad, the Suhite, and Sophar, the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment to come together and visit him, and comfort him."
      v:012: 'JOB:2:12 | 12 | 12 | And when they had lifted up their eyes afar off, they knew him not, and crying out, they wept, and rending their garments, they sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.'
      v:013: 'JOB:2:13 | 13 | 13 | And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no man spoke to him a word: for they saw that his grief was very great.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "JOB:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Cursed his day.</i> Job <i>cursed</i> the day of his birth, not by way of wishing evil to any thing of God's creation; but only to express in a stronger manner his sense of human miseries in general, and of his own calamities in particular. (Challoner) --- He has these only in view: though, in another light, it is better for a man to be born, and to undergo any misery, that he may obtain eternal rewards. (Haydock) --- Some allowances must be made for extreme pain, and for the style of the Eastern (Calmet) poetry. (Haydock) --- Jeremias, (xx. 14.) Habacuc, (i. 2.) the psalmist, and even our Saviour in his agony, made use of such strong expressions, Matthew xxvi. 39., and xxvii. 46. Some heretics accuse Job of impatience and blasphemy. The devil, therefore, came off with victory; and the praises given to Job's patience are false. He might offend by some degree of exaggeration. (Calmet) --- But even that is by no means clear. Time past could not be recalled, nor receive any injury by the maledictions. (Haydock)"
      v:007:
        - 'JOB:3:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Praise,</i> by the appearance of the stars, chap. xxxviii. 7. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - 'JOB:3:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Day.</i> The nations of Ethiopia, under the line, curse the sun as their greatest enemy. (Strabo xvii.) (Pliny, [Natural History?] v. 8.) --- They also brave the fury of the leviathan or crocodile, chap. xl. 27., and xli. 1., and Psalm lxxiii. 14. The natives of Tentyra, upon the Nile, were supposed to be a terror to that monster, or they were very courageous in entangling and pursuing it. (Seneca, q. 4. 2.) (Pliny viii. 25.) --- <i>Leviathan.</i> Protestants, "their mourning." De Dieu rejects this interpretation, substituting "and thou, leviathan, rouse up," &c. The fathers generally understand the devil to be thus designated. Septuagint, "he who is about to seize the great whale," (Haydock) or fish, which they also explain of the conflict of Satan with Jesus Christ. (Origen, &c.)'
      v:010:
        - 'JOB:3:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Nor took.</i> Septuagint, "for it would <i>then</i> have freed my eyes from labour."'
      v:011:
        - 'JOB:3:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>In the.</i> Hebrew, "from the womb," (Haydock) or as soon as I was born. (Calmet) --- He seems to have lost sight of original sin, (ver. 1.) or there might be some method of having it remitted to children unborn, which we do not know. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - 'JOB:3:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Knees,</i> by my father or grandfather, Genesis xxx. 3. (Homer, Iliad ix.) (Calmet)'

      v:014:
        - 'JOB:3:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Consuls.</i> Hebrew, "counsellors," or any in great authority. Septuagint, "kings, the counsellors of the land, who rejoiced, boasting of their swords." The same word, <i>choraboth,</i> (Haydock) means both swords and solitudes. (Du Hamel) --- Those great ones had prepared their own tombs, which were usually in solitary places; (Calmet) or they had filled all with their extensive palaces; and removed the people to a distance. (Haydock)'
      v:015:
        - 'JOB:3:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Houses,</i> while alive; (Calmet) or their tombs were thus enriched with silver, (Menochius) as this practice was not uncommon, ver. 22. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xiii. 15.) --- Marcian forbade it. St. Chrysostom complains it subsisted in his time. (Orat. Annæ.) (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - JOB:3:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Light;</i> dying in the womb. He expresses a desire that he had been thus prevented from feeling his present miseries and danger of sin. (Haydock)

        - 'JOB:3:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Tumult.</i> In the grave they can no longer disturb the world. (Menochius) --- <i>In strength.</i> Septuagint, "in body." Both heroes and labourers then find rest, (Calmet) if they have lived virtuously. (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - 'JOB:3:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Bound</i> in chains, like incorrigible slaves, (Calmet) or debtors. (Cocceius.) --- These were formerly treated with great severity, Luke xii. 59. (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - 'JOB:3:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Not.</i> They feel the same eagerness for death as those who seek for a treasure; (Calmet) and when death is at hand, they rejoice no less than those who discover a <i>grave,</i> in which they hope to find some riches, ver. 15, 22.'
      v:022:
        - 'JOB:3:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Grave,</i> full of stores, or the place where they may repose. (Haydock)'
      v:023:
        - 'JOB:3:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>To.</i> Why is life given to? &c. The uncertainty whether a man be worthy of love or hatred, (Ecclesiastes ix. 1.) and whether he will persevere to the end, is what fills Job with distress; though we must trust that God will suffer none to be tempted above their strength, 1 Corinthians x. 13. --- He finds himself surrounded with precipices, and in the dark. (Calmet) --- So God often tries his faithful servants. (Du Hamel)'
      v:024:
        - 'JOB:3:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Sigh,</i> through difficulty of swallowing, (Pineda) or sense of misery. (Haydock)'
      v:025:
        - JOB:3:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Fear.</i> In prosperity he feared the assaults of pride. Now he is in danger of yielding to impatience and despair. (Calmet)

Pythagoras therefore visited this country. (St. Cyril, contra Jul. x.) --- Eliphaz attempts to prove that no innocent person is chastised. He does not speak of small faults, to which any person may be exposed, and which God may severely punish. But he will have Job to be a great offender, at least in secret, and represents himself in too advantageous a light; though he was really a good man, and meant well. (Calmet) --- But this did not exempt him from sin, (chap. xlii.) no more than Eliu, chap. xxxii. Bonum ex integra causa; malum ex quolibet defectu; as theologians agree. (Haydock)'

(Menochius) (Calmet) --- Many of the assertions of Job's friends are true, but their inferences are false. (Menochius)"

        - 'JOB:4:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Destroyed?</i> They never were eternally. But Abel and many other just persons, have been exposed to tribulation in this world, (Worthington) for their greater improvement. Yet Eliphaz falsely concludes from the sufferings of Job, that he must have been a criminal. (Calmet) --- If any one should now hold the same opinion, we should deem him very ignorant or foolish. But we have observed, (Preface) that this was not so obvious at that time. Cain, the giants, Her, Onan, Sodom, &c., had been made examples of divine vengeance.

You must therefore be guilty. (Calmet) --- Job would never dispute; but God was infinitely more pure than man, who may nevertheless be free from grievous sins. (Worthington) --- The highest angel has nothing but what he has received from God, in comparison with whom he is still as a mere nothing. But this does not prove that Job was a criminal, or that he pretended to arrogate to himself any excellence, independent of the giver of all good gifts. He did not assert that he was impeccable: yet, with God's grace, he might be innocent. (Calmet)"

Though, as he tells them here, it bore no proportion with the greatness of his calamity. (Challoner) --- Job does not deny but he may have transgressed. (Calmet) See chap. vii. 20. --- But his is not conscious of any mortal offence; such as his friends insisted he must have committed, as he was so cruelly tormented. (Haydock) --- Some deny canonical authority to the words of Job, because God reprehended him. But St. Gregory (Mor. vii.) says, <i>Ab æterno judice casurus laudari non potuit.</i> (Du Hamel) --- "The man who was on the point of falling, could not be praised by the eternal Judge;" (Haydock) and it seems to be a mistake that Job erred, (Houbigant) though asserted by many. See Calmet; Worthington, &c. --- <i>Wrath.</i> Hebrew, "O that my grief (Haydock; or complaints. Calmet) were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together."

      v:003:
        - 'JOB:6:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Heavier.</i> The figure hyperbole is frequently used in Scripture, to give us some idea of what surpasses our understanding. Job intimates that the punishment was incomparably greater than his sins. As he and other saints, particularly our Saviour [Jesus Christ] and the blessed Virgin [Mary], have thus patiently suffered more than they had deserved, these merits form part of that treasure of the Church, out of which the pope and bishops are empowered to dispense indulgences, to release people from the pains due to sin, either in this world or in purgatory. (Worthington) --- Septuagint, "Yea, these (sorrows) are heavier than the sand of the sea-shore. But, it seems my words are wicked." (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'JOB:6:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Rage.</i> Hebrew, "poison," (Haydock) or "venom;" (Chaldean; Menochius) as it was customary to use poisoned arrows. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "When I begin to speak, they pierce me. For what! Does the wild ass continually bray, except when he is in quest of food?" (Haydock) --- It is easy for those to be silent who suffer nothing. The wild asses were so common in those parts, (Calmet) that Herod sometimes slew 40 in a hunt. (Josephus, Jewish Wars i. 16.) --- Many fabulous accounts have been given of them. Some are still found in Ethiopia resembling a mule, except in the ears, and beautifully striped with grey, black, and reddish colours. (Bernier)'
      v:006:
        - 'JOB:6:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Salt.</i> I wonder not that you should consider my lamentations as insipid; I now find some consolation in them, ver. 7. (Calmet) --- <i>Or can.</i> Hebrew, "or is there any taste in the white of an egg?" (Protestants) or in blue milk? (Mercer) or "in the spittle, which a man swallows in a dream?" See Isaias xxviii. 8. If pain did not extort these complaints, should I find any pleasure in them? (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "is there any taste in vain words?" Can I hear your arguments without indignation? (Haydock) (Menochius) --- Some manuscripts add, "For to a hungry soul even bitter things appear to be sweet," from Proverbs xxvii. 7. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - "JOB:6:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Off,</i> and release me from this state of misery and danger. (Haydock) --- He is ready to die cheerfully, if it be God's will. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"May the Lord, who has begun, wound me, but not take me away finally. Yea, let my city, over which I have exulted, be my grave. I will not spare, for I have not belied a word of my holy God.\" (Haydock)"
      v:011:
        - 'JOB:6:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>End.</i> Septuagint, "time." I am too weak and short-lived to bear all this. (Haydock) --- I can perceive no end. (Menochius) --- <i>Keep.</i> Protestants, "prolong my life." (Haydock) --- "What is the extent of my soul, to reach so far?" (Calmet) --- Longanimity is the characteristic of a great soul. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - 'JOB:6:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Brass.</i> This is proverbial. Homer (Iliad <u><i>A</i></u>) says, "Attack the Greeks; their skin is neither of stone, (Calmet) iron, or brass." Those who are aware of their own frailty, ought not to expose themselves to dangerous company, particularly to those of the other sex.'
      v:013:
        - 'JOB:6:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Myself.</i> "Have I not placed my trust in him?" God alone. (Haydock) --- All my other friends have abandoned me, ver. 15. (Calmet) --- Can they wonder if I express my grief? (Haydock) --- <i>Familiar.</i> Hebrew, "is wisdom removed far from me?" (Haydock) --- Has my strength abandoned me, so that I cannot be recognized? (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'JOB:6:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Them.</i> They shall run from a less to a greater evil. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "Those who respected me, have now fallen upon me, like snow or ice; (<b>17</b>) as when it is consumed with heat, it is no longer known where it was: (<b>18</b>) thus I have been abandoned by all, lost and expelled from my house." Consider, (<b>19</b>) Hebrew continues, in the comparison of the torrents, (<b>15</b>) "which are hidden by the ice and snow," and are left dry and of no service in summer, when most wanted. (Haydock) --- So these friends stood by me only in the days of my prosperity. (Calmet) --- Luther and the Dutch version follow the Vulgate, Amama says, improperly. He proposes that of Pagnin, "which (torrents) are darkened by the ice. Snow is concealed in (Montanus, upon) them." (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - 'JOB:6:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Entangled.</i> Like meandering streams, my friends act crookedly. (Menochius)'
      v:019:
        - 'JOB:6:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>While.</i> Till the torrents subside, when the caravans from these towns of Arabia may pass on. Job may also address his friends, (Calmet) and bid them consider how few had taken any notice of him. (Menochius) --- Protestants, "the troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them."'
      v:020:
        - 'JOB:6:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>I.</i> Hebrew, "they had hoped" to pass along. (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - 'JOB:6:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Come.</i> Hebrew, "are good for nothing." (Calmet) --- Protestant marginal note, "<i>like</i> to them."'
      v:025:
        - 'JOB:6:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Why.</i> Hebrew, "How strong are the words of truth!" (Calmet) --- <i>Whereas.</i> Protestants, "But what doth your arguing reprove?" What part of my discourse do you find erroneous? Septuagint, "But it seems the words of the man of truth are deceitful. Yet I do not beg from you (a word or) strength." (Haydock)'
      v:026:
        - 'JOB:6:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Wind.</i> Job humbles the vanity of Eliphaz. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "nor shall your rebuke silence my words: for I will not admit the sound of your discourse. Nay, you rush," &c.'
      v:030:
        - 'JOB:6:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Mouth.</i> He engages their attention. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "Cannot my taste discern perverse things," (Protestants; Haydock) or "the evil" which I endure? My complaints are not surely unfounded. (Calmet)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JOB:7:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Warfare.</i> Hebrew, "is it not determined" (Haydock) for some short space, as the Levites had to serve from 30 to 50 years of age; (Numbers iv. 3., and viii. 25.) and the days of a <i>hireling</i> are also defined and short, Isaias xvi. 14. (Amama) --- No soldier or hireling was ever treated so severely as Job. Yet they justly look for the term of their labours. Septuagint have {GREEK:START peiraterion}πηιρατηριον{GREEK:END}. Old Vulgate <i>tentatio.</i> "Is not the life of man a temptation?" (Calmet) --- Palæstra, school, or time given to learn the exercise of a soldier and wrestler; or of one who has to prepare himself for a spiritual warfare, and for heaven. (Haydock) --- Are we not surrounded with dangers? and may we not desire to be set at liberty? The Vulgate is very accurate, (Calmet) and includes all these senses. (Haydock) --- A soldier must be obedient even unto death, and never resist his superior. (Worthington) --- <i>Hireling,</i> who has no rest till the day is spent. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'JOB:7:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>And have.</i> Hebrew, "they have appointed for me." (Calmet) --- God treats me with more severity, as even the night is not a time of rest for me, and my months of service are without any present recompense. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'JOB:7:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>And again.</i> Hebrew, "and the night be completed, I toss to and fro," (Haydock) or "I am disturbed with dreams, (Calmet) till day break." Vulgate insinuates that night and day are equally restless to a man in extreme pain. (Haydock) --- As I find no comfort, why may I not desire to die? (Menochius) --- I desire to be dissolved, as being much better, said St. Paul. [Philippians i. 23.]'
      v:006:
        - "JOB:7:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Web.</i> Hebrew, \"the weaver's shuttle,\" chap. xvi. 23., and Isaias xxxviii. 12. (Haydock) --- The pagans have used the same comparison. But they make the three daughters of Necessity guide the thread of life. (Plato, Rep. xii.; Natal. iii. 6.) --- Septuagint, \"my life is swifter than speech.\" Tetrapla, \"than a runner.\" (Calmet) --- <i>Hope. Heu fugit,</i> &c. Ah! time is flying , never to return! (Haydock)"

        - 'JOB:7:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>More.</i> This may be explained both of the soul and of the body, Psalm cii. 16. The former resides in the body for a short time, and then seems to take no farther notice of it (Calmet) till the resurrection.'

        - 'JOB:7:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Sea.</i> Ungovernable and malicious. Some of the ancients looked upon the sea as a huge animal, whose breathing caused the tides. (Strabo i.; Solin xxxii.) --- They represented its fury as proverbial. "Fire, the sea, and woman are three evils;" and they call the most savage people sons of Neptune. (Agel. xv. 21.) --- Am I so violent as to require such barriers? Am I capacious, or strong enough to bear such treatment? (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - 'JOB:7:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Hanging.</i> Protestants, "strangling and death, rather than my life," or Marginal note, "bones." (Haydock) --- Any species of Death would be preferable to this misery. (Calmet) --- Who would not entertain the same sentiments, if the fear of worse in the other world did not withhold him? But Job had reason to hope that his sorrows would end with his life. (Haydock) --- It is thought that he was dreadfully tempted to despair. (Calmet) --- Yet he resisted manfully, and overcame all attempts of the wicked one.'

        - 'JOB:7:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Suddenly.</i> During his whole life, he is exposed to dangers; (Calmet) of if, at first, he taste some comfort, that is presently over. The greatest saints have experienced this treatment. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - "JOB:7:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Sinned.</i> I acknowledge my frailty. (Menochius) --- How may I obtain redress? (Calmet) --- Job's friends maintained that he was guilty. But he does not acquiesce in their conclusion, that these sufferings were precisely in punishment of some crime, though he acknowledges that he is not without his faults. (Haydock) --- <i>Shall.</i> Hebrew also, \"what have I done to thee?\" I have only hurt myself. But this reasoning is nugatory. Though God loses nothing by our sins, they are no less offensive to him, as the rebel does his utmost to disturb the order which he has established. The sinner indeed resembles those brutal people, who hurl darts against the sun, which fall upon their own heads, chap. iii. 8. (Calmet) --- <i>Opposite,</i> as a butt to shoot at. (Haydock) --- <i>Myself.</i> Hebrew was formerly \"to thee,\" till the Jews changed it, as less respectful. (Cajetan) --- Septuagint still read, \"and why am I a burden to thee?\" (Haydock) as I am under the necessity of complaining, in my own defence. (Calmet) --- I throw my grief upon the Lord, that He may support me, Psalm liv. 23., and 1 Peter v. 7. (Pineda)"

(Calmet) --- It is true, these were afterwards conforted in honour, except the first, who was slain, and better off in the other world. But Job might hope for the same treatment; and no man can be pronounced happy or miserable till his death. After a storm a calm frequently ensues; as Baldad might have seen verified in the person of his friend, if he had waited patiently, and not judged so peremptorily from equivocal arguments.

(Sir W. Hamilton) --- Septuagint, "who makes the mountains grown old, and they know not who overturns them in his wrath." (Haydock) --- Kings and empires fall to ruin at his command. (Calmet)'

      v:008:
        - 'JOB:9:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Heavens,</i> like a tent, Psalm ciii. 2. These nations lived under tents; (Calmet) and beholding the magnificent one which God had spread over the heads of all, Job, in rapture, (Haydock) wonders that he should have created such a pavilion for his servants.'
      v:009:
        - "JOB:9:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Arcturus,</i> &c. These are names of stars or constellations. In Hebrew, Hash, Cesil, and Cima. (Challoner) --- And <i>chadre theman,</i> (Haydock) the \"bottom <i>or</i> seals of the south,\" which were to him invisible, being the Antarctic constellations. The ancients were acquainted only with these four, (Homer; Virgil, Æneid iii., &c.) which denoted the four quarters and seasons. (Calmet) --- <i>Ash, Arcturus,</i> \"the bear's tail,\" near the north pole, (Haydock) rules in autumn, when the year begins (Calmet) in Arabia. <i>Cesil,</i> (Haydock) or <i>Orion,</i> on the west, styled by astronomers \"the heart of the scorpion,\" rises about the autumnal equinox, and presides over winter; (Calmet) and <i>Cima,</i> (Haydock) the <i>Hyades,</i> or the seven \"rainy\" stars, do over spring, the \"pleasing\" season, as <i>Cima</i> denotes, (chap. xxxviii. 31.) when navigation commences. \"The seals of the south,\" designate summer. (Calmet) --- We must not, however, imagine that Job countenances poetical fables; (St. Jerome in Amos v. 8.) or that he called the constellations by these names, <i>Arcturus,</i> &c. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, \"who makes the fire, the spirit, and the light,\" <i>Cima,</i> chap. xxxviii. 31. (Haydock) --- The creation of these seems grander than the making of any constellation, and all the stars had been asserted to be the work of God, ver. 7. What connection is there between the names assigned by the Rabbins and the Hebrew terms? R. Abraham observes that the last is \"a northern star, causing <i>heat,</i> and producing fruit.\" (Parkhurst) --- The Arabs were convinced of the influence of the stars; (chap. xxxviii. 31.) and living under a sky generally without clouds, could easily observe them. (Roger. ii. 2., and 15.) --- Sanchez asserts, that the peasants in Spain can point out the stars by name. (Calmet) --- <i>Inner.</i> Protestants, \"the chambers.\" They agree with the Vulgate in the other names. Septuagint, \"who makes the Pleiads, and Hesper, and Arcturus, and the store-rooms of the south?[\"] (Haydock) --- They are styled <i>inner</i> with respect to us, who cannot see them."
      v:011:
        - 'JOB:9:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Understand,</i> as he is a spirit; (Menochius) and not that God is changeable, but his works and judgments are above our comprehension, and we are always liable to change. Hence the proud erroneously think themselves to be in favour; while the humble, on the contrary, keep at a distance, and still sue for pardon, when their sins have been forgiven, Luke xviii. 13., and Ecclesiasticus ii. 1. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - 'JOB:9:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>God.</i> Protestants, "<i>If</i> God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him." Septuagint, "For he is not turned aside by wrath;" (or Roman edition) "God, whose anger cannot be averted," (Haydock) unless we repent: (Calmet) "under him the whales below heaven bend." (Haydock) --- Perhaps they may have had some notions, like the Rabbins, respecting Leviathan; and St. Jerome may have alluded to the fable of the giants placed under mountains; (Virgil, Æneid iii., and ix.; Calmet) or to Atalas propping the skies. (Haydock) --- <i>World.</i> Great heroes, (Calmet) Kings, (Pineda) angels, (Menochius) who move the spheres, (Worthington) or devils, Ephesians vi. 12. (Cajetan)'

        - "JOB:9:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>What?</i> Hebrew, \"Much less shall I answer him, choosing <i>even my</i> words with him.\" (Haydock) --- This is the conclusion from the display of God's power. (Calmet) --- No eloquence will persuade him. (Haydock) --- Though not conscious of any sin, Job will not justify himself (1 Corinthians iv.; Worthington) before God. (Haydock)"
      v:016:
        - "JOB:9:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Voice.</i> So much am I beneath his notice. How unjust were the aspersions of Job's friends, who accused him of presumption and blasphemy! (Calmet) --- No one ever spoke with greater humility (Haydock) and respect of God's absolute dominion. (Calmet) --- He will attribute nothing to his own prayers, as he is still in the dark. (Menochius)"
      v:017:
        - "JOB:9:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Without cause.</i> That is, without my knowing the cause; or without any crime of mine. (Challoner) --- To argue from my afflictions, that I am a criminal, is unjust, chap. ii. 3.{JOIN}{BQ:2}\"Notions mistaken, reasonings ill apply'd,{JOIN}{BQ:2}And sophisms that conclude on either side.\" (Pope, <i>Pleasures,</i> &c.)"
      v:019:

      v:020:
        - 'JOB:9:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Condemn me,</i> as this conduct would appear presumptuous. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "if I be just, my mouth will utter impiety," (Haydock) in declaring it. (Olymp.)'

(Menochius) --- The misery inflicted on the just, is not contrary to the goodness of the Almighty. Job perfectly discovered this truth, which puzzled his enlightened friends, and most of those who lived before Christ; (Psalm lxxii. 2., and Jeremias xii. 1.; Calmet) and even Job himself was not fully convinced of the motives of the Providence, till God had explained them. (Houbigant) (Chap. xlii.)'
      v:023:
        - 'JOB:9:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Innocent.</i> Having expressed his sentiments clearly, now he mentions what he could desire under the pressure of misery. (Menochius) --- Seeing the danger of falling, to which he was exposed, he begged to be delivered by death. We are taught by our Saviour to pray, <i>Lead us not into temptation,</i> Matthew vi. 13. God does not laugh at our sufferings, but he acts like a surgeon, and cuts without minding our complaints. Ridere Dei <i>est humanæ nolle afflictioni misereri.</i> (St. Gregory) (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent." (Protestants) (Haydock)'
      v:024:
        - 'JOB:9:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Wicked</i> one, (Haydock) the devil, (Menochius) or any impious person who enjoys prosperity. He, (Calmet) or even God permissively, <i>covered the face,</i> (Haydock) by bribes; so that judges pass sentence unjustly. --- <i>Then.</i> If it be not the devil, (Menochius) or God. (Calmet)'
      v:025:
        - 'JOB:9:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Good,</i> of late. Hebrew, "they see no good."'
      v:026:
        - 'JOB:9:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Carrying.</i> Hebrew literally, "of desire," belonging to one person, or full of goods, which he desires to carry quickly to market. (Menochius) --- Chaldean agrees with us. But most interpreters vary. Pagnin retains the original, <i>ebe;</i> (Haydock) supposing the river Abeh, or Avah, is meant. It certainly implies expedition; "they have hastened like (Calmet) the eagle to its prey." Septuagint, "Is there any trace of ships, or of an eagle flying in quest of food?" (Haydock)'
      v:027:
        - 'JOB:9:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Sorrow.</i> I cannot entirely repress it. (Calmet) --- The more I strive, (Haydock) the greater is my pain. (Menochius)'
      v:028:
        - 'JOB:9:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Works.</i> Hebrew, "sorrows." I dread their increase, and fear impatience. Even in the midst of prosperity, Job offered sacrifice, lest the sins of his children should be laid to his charge.'
      v:029:
        - 'JOB:9:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Vain.</i> Why have I endeavoured to repress my grief in silence? God does not forbid us to complain, but only to murmur. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "Since I am wicked, why did I not die?" (Haydock) --- Should a wretch be even suffered to live? (St. Chrysostom)'
      v:030:
        - 'JOB:9:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Snow.</i> Nitre brings off the dirt better. Chaldean, "soap." Hebrew <i>bor,</i> is supposed by many to be the <i>Borith</i> of Jeremias ii. 22. Snow-water was also used through delicacy in summer. (Petronius; Sat.)'
      v:031:
        - 'JOB:9:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Abhor me.</i> This striking expression intimates something extremely filthy. God will make his servants discern many stains, even when they have aimed at the greatest purity. (Calmet)'
      v:033:
        - 'JOB:9:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>There.</i> Septuagint, "O that an umpire, (<i>or</i> mediator) were between us, and one arguing and giving ear in the midst of both!"'
      v:035:
        - "JOB:9:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Fear him.</i> Septuagint, \"and I shall not fear, but speak. For I am not conscious to myself of injustice.\" (Haydock) --- The dread of incurring God's displeasure makes me prefer to be silent; and if I had no other reason, this fear would suffice, as I should not be master of myself under such anxiety and pain. (Calmet) --- If my sufferings were at an end, I should take courage, and speak in my own defence, (Menochius) in answer to my false friends. (Haydock)"

Sophar was probably a descendant of Sepho, styled by Septuagint <i>Sophar,</i> (Genesis xxxvi. 11., and 1 Paralipomenon i. 36.) brother of Theman, and grandson of Eliphaz, the son of Esau. (Calmet) --- He speaks with greater insolence than the two others, (Pineda) and inveighs against Job, insisting that he can be punished thus only for his crimes. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'JOB:11:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Much.</i> The speeches of Job seemed tedious to him, because he was not of his opinion. (Menochius) --- He might have applied to himself and his friends the fault of talking too much, as they all spoke many things to no purpose, whereas Job went straight to the point. (Worthington)'

We might translate, "and that the reality of thy crimes deserved double punishment," &c. The obligations of the natural, and also of the written law of Moses, with which Job was (Calmet) perhaps (Haydock) acquainted, (chap. xxii. 22.) are very numerous and difficult. The ways of Providence are not easily understood, though some are obvious enough. He rewards and punishes. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "for it is double of what <i>has come</i> against thee, and then thou wouldst know that thy sins are justly requited." Protestants, "that <i>they are</i> double to that which is: Know, therefore, that God exacteth of thee <i>less</i> than thine iniquity <i>deserveth,</i>" 1 Esdras ix. 13. (Haydock)'

(Calmet) --- Some have supposed that Job really did so in extreme anguish, (Ven. Bede) the leprosy occasioning such an insupportable irritation.

No: but I shall speak and arraign [you] before him,\" &c. The words <i>not</i> and <i>you</i> are thus placed in Grabe's edition.

The moral actions of men being also infinite in their object, tending to God, or contradicting his ordinances, they are not beneath the consideration of an infinite Being. (Calmet)"
      v:004:
        - "JOB:14:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Seed,</i> is not expressed in Hebrew, \"<i>unclean.</i>\" It may refer to Adam. There is no contagion in the seed to infect the soul, as Tertullian supposed; it in only <i>unclean</i> in the cause, as every person who is born according to the common course of nature, becomes a child of Adam, and partakes in his original sin. (The Scholastics) (Tirinus) --- <i>Only art.</i> Essence itself. (Denis the Carthusian) --- \"The justification of the sinner is a greater miracle than the creation of the world.\" (St. Augustine, ibid.) --- The birth of Jesus Christ was free from stain; (Luke i. 35.) as was also the conception of his virgin Mother [Mary], by the power of God; (Menochius) and his grace, as it is piously believed. (Haydock) --- He alone can purify man. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, \"who can produce what is clean out of the unclean? Not one.\" Or Chaldean, \"Is there not one?\" Septuagint, \"For who shall be pure from corruption? Not so much as one: (<b>5</b>) though his life be only of one day upon earth.\" The more ancient Fathers have generally quoted the text in this manner, to prove original sin; (Haydock; St. Cyrian; Tertullian, St. Deo. Mag.[St. Leo the Great?] in Nat. i., &c.; Tirinus) and Bellarmine almost does the same, (Grat. iv. 4.) observing that the Septuagint have taken in three words from the following verse: \"though his days are few.\" Yet there are some words which are not in Hebrew, though the doctrine here maintained is indubitable. (Amama) --- Job was fully convinced of it, and adduced it as plea for mercy. It also tends to keep us in the most profound humility and watchfulness, to resist the motions of concupiscence. (Calmet) --- Man,{JOIN}{BQ:2}-----\"Now too late,{JOIN}{BQ:2}Saw the rash error, which he could not mend;{JOIN}{BQ:2}An error fatal not to him alone,{JOIN}{BQ:2}But to his future sons, his fortune's heirs.\" (Blair's Grave.

(Haydock) --- These words are repeated in the office for the dead, in the name of the souls in purgatory. (Denis the Carthusian, a. 34.) --- They are adduced in proof of limbo. But <i>sheol</i> denotes also "the grave." (Amama) --- What then? The soul is not confined there. It must consequently be explained of the lower receptacle for souls, as well as of the grave.

Job is speaking chiefly of the body in the grave, and of what appear exteriorly. During life man cannot foresee the state of his children; nor in the other world, would their condition render him happy or otherwise.

        - 'JOB:19:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Ten times;</i> very often. --- <i>Oppress me.</i> Hebrew word occurs no where else, and is variously translated. It may signify, "to dig a pit for me," chap vi. 27., and Psalm vi. 6. Job repeats nearly what he had said before, only with greater vehemence. He admits that Providence treats him in an unusual manner. Yet he still retains an assured hope, and arraigns his adversaries before the divine tribunal. (Calmet) --- Yet he rather hesitates; (ver. 4, 6.) and this species of ignorance is the folly of which he, at last, accuses himself, chap. xlii. 3. It was no real fault, chap. xlii. 8. (Haydock)'

        - 'JOB:19:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>With me.</i> I alone am answerable for it. But I am no wiser for your remarks. If I have sinned, have I not been sufficiently punished?

He talks thus ironically. (Haydock)'

      v:006:
        - "JOB:19:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>With an equal judgment.</i> St. Gregory explains these words thus: Job being a just man, and truly considering his own life, thought that his affliction was greater than his sins deserved; and in that respect, that the punishment was not equal, yet it was just, as coming from God, who gives a <i>crown of justice</i> to those who suffer for righteousness' sake, and proves the just with tribulations, as gold is tried by fire. (Challoner) --- He knew that God would surely give a just reward, 2 Timothy iv. (St. Gregory xiv. 16.) (Worthington) --- The friends of Job had too contracted a notion of Providence, supposing that the virtuous could not be afflicted. Job allowed that the ordinary rules were not here observed. Hebrew, \"the Lord hath perverted <i>or</i> overthrown me.\" (Calmet) --- This gave him no small uneasiness. If the thing had been as plain as it appears now to us, he might have refuted all with a bare denial. (Houbigant)"

Mercury and Autolychus are praised for thefts of this description. (Odys. xix.) See Judges xi. 3.

(<b>18</b>) But they cast me from them for ever. When I arise, they speak against me.\" (Haydock) --- Interpreters generally suppose that Job speaks of the children by his inferior wives: though he might have some at home by the first wife, who were not old enough to be invited to the feast, with those who were destroyed. (Calmet)"
      v:018:
        - 'JOB:19:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Fools;</i> wicked men, (Menochius) or the meanest of the people, (Calmet) whom (Haydock) these unnatural children (Calmet) resembled. Hebrew, "young children." (Protestants) (Haydock)'

      v:024:
        - 'JOB:19:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>In a.</i> Hebrew, "lead, in the rock for ever." (Protestants) Septuagint have, "for ever," after <i>book,</i> (ver. 23) and subjoins, "with a writing instrument of iron and (or) lead, or be engraven on the rocks for a memorial." Grabe insinuates that before there was only, "and on lead, or be engraven on the rocks." (Haydock) --- <i>Instrument,</i> (<i>celte</i>) means "a chisel," (Haydock) like <i>cœlum</i> from <i>cœlo:</i> " I engrave." (Pineda) --- St. Jerome, (ad Pam.) and the late editor of his works, retain this word, as the older editions of St. Gregory did; (Calmet) though <i>certe,</i> "surely," has been inserted instead, from several manuscripts by the Benedictines. (Haydock) --- Ancient manuscripts and Latin Bibles have more generally the latter word. But the received editions are supported by many manuscripts (Calmet) and the Septuagint {GREEK:START eggluthenai}ηγγλυθηναι{GREEK:END}, expresses as much. <i>Celtis est, <u>gluthaion</u>.</i> (Amama). (Casaub. in Athen. vii. 20. p. 556.) --- An inscription, in Dalmatia, has the same sense: <i>Neque hic atramentum vel papyrus aut membrana ulla adhuc; sed malleolo et celte literatus silex.</i> "Here as yet was neither ink, nor paper, nor any parchments; but a flint stone was lettered with a mallet and a chisel.." The former modes of writing were not, in effect, invented in the days of Job. (Calmet) --- But it was long very usual to make use of lead. (Pineda) --- What he desired to have written in such durable characters, (Haydock) was the following sentence, in proof of his unshaken confidence in God, and as a refutation of his friends, who accused him of despair and blasphemy, (Calmet) as also the whole history of his conflict. His desire has been granted. (Tirinus)'
      v:025:
        - "JOB:19:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Redeemer</i> may be understood of the Deity, without confining it to the second Person; (Isaias xli. 14., and xlix. 7.; Piscator) though it may have a more peculiar reference to Christ: (Junius; Haydock) in whom he believed, as the Redeemer of all mankind. (Calmet) --- <i>Earth.</i> Yea, ere long I shall be restored to health, (St. Chrysostom; Grotius) as an earnest and figure of the resurrection. Nothing is more common, in Scripture, than for the same prophecy to have a double accomplishment; one soon after it is made public, and another more sublime and remote. Job seemed to have no expectation of surviving his present misery, (ver. 7., and chap. vii. 7., and xxiv. 15.) unless God now revealed it to him, as a figure of his future resurrection, founded on the hope of our Saviour's, which he expresses in much clearer terms. Hebrew, \"I know that my Redeemer is living, and that he will raise himself one day upon the earth,\" (Calmet) like a conqueror, (Haydock) or wrestler, having overthrown his antagonist: (Amama) or, \"he will stand the last upon the earth, <i>or</i> dust,\" (Piscator) ascending his throne, to judge all. (Deodat.) --- Yet Luther translates, \"and one day he will raise me up from the earth;\" which is not conformable to the Hebrew. Others explain, \"he....will place (<b>26</b>) this, my skin, after they (worms) shall have ruined it.\" (Pagnin; Montanus) --- But Amama suspects that the latter is not in earnest. Pineda defends the Vulgate and observes that <i>yakum</i> (Haydock) may signify, \"will raise\" himself, or \"me;\" the latter being at least a consequence of the former, if St. Jerome did not read it <i>me</i> in his copy. So St. Paul argues; <i>If Christ be risen, we also shall rise again.</i> Septuagint, \"For I know that he is eternal, who will set me free,\" (Haydock) by death, (Calmet; or redemption; {GREEK:START ekluein}ηκλυηιν{GREEK:END}) \"upon the earth.\""
      v:026:
        - "JOB:19:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>And I.</i> Septuagint, \"But he will raise up my body <i>or</i> skin, which has sustained these things. This now has been accomplished for me by the Lord; (<b>27</b>) which I know within myself, which my eyes have seen, and not another. For all things are accomplished in my bosom.\" I am as fully convinced of this glorious event, (Haydock) as if it were past. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, \"and <i>though,</i> after my skin, <i>worms</i> destroy <i>this</i> body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.\" (Protestants, or in the margin, \"After I shall awake, though this body be destroyed, yet out of,\" &c. Various other interpretations are given. (Haydock) --- But we had as well adhere to the Septuagint, Vulgate, &c. (Du Hamel) --- <i>God.</i> Sixtus V and some other editions, add \"Saviour.\" (Calmet) --- Job would see the Messias by the eyes of his posterity. (St. Augustine or Faustus, ser. 234. t. v. App.) (Sanctius) --- He hoped also to see God face to face in glory (Calmet) though not by means of his corporeal eyes, (Haydock) and to be restored to favour, so that God would no longer turn his back on him, chap. xlii. 5. St. Gregory, when legate at Constantinople, convinced the patriarch Eutychius, by this text, that after the resurrection, our bodies would still be palpable, and not aerial only. (Calmet) --- It contains an express profession of Job's faith, on this head. We shall rise the same in substance. (Worthington)"
      v:027:
        - 'JOB:19:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Myself.</i> Hebrew, "for myself," and for my comfort; not like the reprobate, who shall see their judge to their eternal confusion. Job insists so much on this point, that he shews he is not speaking merely of the divine favour being restored to him, in the re-establishment of his health and affairs, but that he raises his mind to something more solid and desirable, of which the former was only a faint representation. (Calmet) --- "No one since Christ has spoken so plainly of the resurrection, as this man did before the coming of the Messias." (St. Jerome, ad Pam.) --- <i>This.</i> Hebrew, "<i>though</i> my reins be consumed within me;" (Protestants; Haydock) or, "my reins (desires and tender affections) are completed in my bosom."

        - 'JOB:19:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Let us.</i> Septuagint, "Why do we contend against him? and the root of the word (reason) we shall find in him." He provokes us to speak thus.

(Menochius) --- <i>Various.</i> Hebrew, "Hence do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for <i>this</i> I hasten." Septuagint, "I did not thus suspect that thou wouldst contradict these things," &c. (Haydock) --- Sophar only speaks this second time; and he produces little new, but begins with an air of more moderation, as if the arguments of Job had made some impression upon him. (Calmet) --- He attempts to prove that the wicked have no comfort long; which is true in one sense, as all time is short, though they may prosper all their lives, as Job corrects his observation, chap. xxi. 13. (Worthington)'
      v:004:

      v:008:
        - 'JOB:20:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Fleeth.</i> The poets assign wings to sleep and to dreams. (Homer, &c.) Isaias (xxix. 7.) describes a man who dreams that he is eating, and finds himself hungry when he awakes. Such is the live of the avaricious, (Calmet) and of all wicked people. (Haydock)'
      v:009:

      v:011:
        - 'JOB:20:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Vices of,</i> is not in Hebrew, but must be understood. (Haydock) --- <i>Youth.</i> Some translate, "hidden." Sophar perhaps accuses Job of some secret abominations, for which he was afflicted with the venereal disease. At least, nothing is more common than to see people brought to old age and infirmities unnumbered, (Calmet) before their time, in consequence of riotous living in their youth. (Haydock) --- Youth may also denote the sin in which we are born, which is the source of all our maladies, and is always dragging us towards the grave. (Calmet)'

        - 'JOB:20:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Head.</i> Hebrew, "venom." Septuagint, "the wrath of dragons." (Calmet) --- <i>Vipers.</i> The same Hebrew term is elsewhere rendered basilisk, or asp. The precise import of such things is not easily ascertained. (Pineda) --- <i>Tongue.</i> The ancients thought that serpents communicated the venom by the tongue, or sting. Moderns think they do it rather by the teeth. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'JOB:20:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Butter.</i> The impious may have a short-lived pleasure, but it will not give perfect satisfaction. The poets use similar expressions.

      v:021:
        - 'JOB:20:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Continue.</i> Hebrew, "no one shall look for his goods." The sinner eat up all in his life-time, or saw his possessions slip from him. (Haydock) --- At least, he shall not take them with him to the grave. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - 'JOB:20:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>May.</i> Hebrew, "And <i>when</i> he shall be about to fill his belly," like king Baltassar, death shall hurry him away.

      v:024:
        - 'JOB:20:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Brass;</i> of which metal the strongest bows were made. Protestants have, "steel:" (Haydock) but brass was used by the ancients for the same purpose. (Calmet) --- This proverb shews that those who endeavour to escape from men, fall into the hands of God. (Delrio. Adag. 9, t. ii.){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare Charybdim.</i> (Virgil) (Menochius)'

        - 'JOB:20:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>The sword is,</i> occurs not in the Vulgate, (Haydock) though it be in the Complutensian and Sixtine editions.

        - 'JOB:20:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Darkness,</i> or misery. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "Terrors upon him, (<b>26</b>) and all darkness may await him." (Haydock) --- He shall find no means of escaping. (Calmet) --- <i>Kindled.</i> Hebrew, "blown." St. Gregory observes that hell-fire is corporeal, but very different from our material fire. Chaldean, &c., explain this passage in the same sense. It may also intimate interior anguish, (Calmet) lightning, (Vatable) pestilence, (Grotius) and every species of calamity. (Calmet) --- <i>Tabernacle,</i> in hell. (Menochius) --- We may also translate, "he who is left," (Haydock) the offspring shall be also miserable. (Menochius)'
      v:027:
        - 'JOB:20:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Heavens,</i> as his sins have cried for vengeance, Genesis xviii. 20. (Calmet) --- All creatures shall fight against the wicked. (Menochius)'

Have I not then reason to tremble? ver. 6. (Haydock) --- Though he disputed with men, it was concerning Providence and eternal things. (Worthington)'

        - "JOB:21:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Hearken to.</i> Literally, \"look steadfastly on me.\" (Haydock) --- Compare my present with my former condition, and do not pretend to fathom God's judgments; which fill me also with astonishment, when I consider why the virtuous are distressed, and the wicked prosper, ver. 7. --- <i>Mouth</i> be silent.

        - 'JOB:21:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Riches.</i> This is what fills me with great anxiety. Yet it quite destroys the force of your argument, (Calmet) since you pretend that the prosperity of the wicked is never of long duration. We see them, however, live to an advanced old age, (Haydock) continually offending God, and annoying their neighbours. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "yea, they grow old in riches."'

(Menochius) --- A sudden death, without agony or sickness, (Haydock) was the choice of Julius Cæsar, the night before he was slain. <i>Repentinum inopinatumque prætulerat.</i> (Suetonius) --- But the enlightened servant of God would rather desire time to do penance, and to prepare for death. For who shall presume that he has that charity which banisheth fear? (Calmet) --- <i>Hell.</i> The same term is used for the place where the damned are tormented, as for that where the souls of the just waited (chap. vii., and xvii.) for their Redeemer's coming. But here Job is speaking of the apparent happiness of the wicked; (Haycock) and only alludes to the grave, (Calmet; Menochius) or comfortable death and burial of the reprobate: though, at the same time, he may declare that their souls are buried in hell.

Alexandrian Septuagint, "For good things were in their hands: but the works of the impious are not pure." No: the more they possess, the greater is their perversity. Grabe substitutes {GREEK:START oukathora}ουκαθορα{GREEK:END}, for {GREEK:START kathara}καθαρα{GREEK:END}; God "does not behold" the works, &c., which is more conformable to the other editions; and thus the blasphemies of the impious are continued.

Such things are, therefore, a very equivocal argument, to prove either side of the question. Those who are afflicted, and cling closer to God, must be accounted virtuous and happy; while that prosperity is fatal which is an occasion of our neglecting his service. (Calmet) --- Job answers his own questions, ver. 7. If the wicked be happy for a time, their future state is deplorable, and often they forfeit even their temporal advantages. (Menochius)'

Septuagint, (Calmet) or Theodotion, "the wicked is kept on high," {GREEK:START chouthizetai}χουθιζηται{GREEK:END}. All from ver. 28 to 33 inclusively, is marked as an addition to the Septuagint by Grabe, who has supplied many similar omissions, of which Origen and St. Jerome complained. (Haydock)'
      v:031:
        - 'JOB:21:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Done.</i> Man is afraid, and God defers to take cognizance. (Calmet)'
      v:032:
        - "JOB:21:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Dead.</i> Hebrew, \"the sheaves,\" being quite ripe for harvest, and even in the tomb, the tyrant retains some sore of pre-eminence, as he is buried with honour, an set like a more elevated sheaf, to inspect the rest. (Calmet) --- <i>Godiss,</i> is rendered by Protestants, \"tomb,\" (margin) \"heap.\" But (chap. v. 26.) where only the word occurs again, we find \"a shock of corn,\" and this comparison seems very suitable here. The damned shall <i>watch,</i> alas, when it will be to no purpose, among the heap of fellow-sufferers, who would not think while they had time to repent. After millions of night spent thus without sleep or ease, we may imagine we hear their mournful lamentations from the depth of the abyss. Always misery! and never any hope of ease! (Haydock) --- \"Eternity,\" says Bridayne, (ser. in Maury's Eloq.) \"is a pendulum, the vibration of which sounds continually, Always! Never! In the mean while, a reprobate cries out: What o'clock is it? And the same voice answers, Eternity!\" Thus at last the wicked shal awake from the sleep in which they have spent their days; (Haydock) and their watching, restless, and immortal souls (St. Thomas Aquinas) will bitterly lament their past folly. What profit will they derive from the honours paid to their corpse by surviving friends, (Haydock) even though they be embalmed, and seem to live in marble statues? (Pineda)"
      v:033:
        - 'JOB:21:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Acceptable to the gravel of Cocytus.</i> The Hebrew word, which St. Jerome has here rendered by the name <i>Cocytus,</i> (which the poets represent as a river in hell) signifies a <i>valley</i> or a <i>torrent:</i> and in this place, is taken for the low region of death, and hell: which willingly, as it were, receives the wicked at their death: who are ushered in by innumerable others that have gone before them; and are followed by multitudes above number. (Challoner) --- Isaias (xiv. 9.) and Ezechiel (xxxii. 21.) describe the splendid reception in hell of the kings of Babylon and of Egypt, nearly in the same manner as Job does that of any sinner who has lived in prosperity, chap. xxxviii. 17. He gives life to the whole creation, in the true spirit of poetry. (Calmet) --- The rich man is represented as tenderly embraced by his mother earth; (chap. i. 21.; Haydock) the very stones and turf press lightly upon him; as the ancients prayed, <i>Sit tibi terra levis.</i> Hebrew, "the stones <i>or</i> clods of the torrent (Calmet) shall be sweet to him, and he," &c. (Haydock) --- St. Jerome has chosen to mention a particular river, instead of the general term <i>nel,</i> "a torrent or vale," to intimate that Job is speaking of the state after death. --- <i>Cocytus</i> is a branch of the Styx, a river of Arcadia, of a noxious quality, which the poets have place in hell. (Pineda) --- Septuagint, "The pebbles of the torrent became sweet to him, and in his train every man shall come, and unnumbered men before him." Alexandrian manuscript has "men of number;" the two first letters of {GREEK:START anarithmetoi}αναριθμητοι{GREEK:END} being omitted. (Haydock) --- The Church reads in her office for St. Stephen, <i>Lapides torrentis illi dulces fuerunt: ipsum sequuntur omnes animæ justæ.</i> Many explain this passage of Job as a menace. The wicked have carried their insolence so far as to (Calmet) give orders to (Haydock) be buried with the utmost pomp: but in the other world, they shall be thrown ignominiously among the other dead. (St. Gregory, &c.) (Calmet) --- They were little moved with the thought of death, as it was common to all. But what will they think of eternal misery? (Haydock)'
      v:034:

        - JOB:22:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Knowledge.</i> How then canst thou dispute with God?
      v:003:
        - 'JOB:22:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Profit.</i> God rules all with justice or with mercy: since, therefore, he punishes, it must be for some guilt, and not for his own advantage. But he might still chastise for the good of man, or to manifest his own power, John ix. 3. God also punishes the sinner for the wrong which he does to himself. (St. Augustine, Conf. iii. 8.) Any one may discover the sophism of Eliphaz. If God were indifferent with regard to our virtue, who would be able to advance one step towards him? (Calmet) --- Man is unprofitable indeed to God, but he may reap great advantage from piety himself; and this is what God desires, as well as his own glory, Matthew v. 17. (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - 'JOB:22:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Fear.</i> Thus malefactors are condemned, that they may no longer disturb society. But may not God afflict the just, though he have nothing to fear? (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'JOB:22:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Iniquities.</i> He adduces no fresh arguments, but boldly taxes Job with many crimes, which a person in his station might have committed. He rashly concludes that he must have fallen into some of them at least. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'JOB:22:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Pledge.</i> Hebrew, "person." Debtors might be sold, Matthew xviii. 30.'
      v:007:
        - "JOB:22:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Water.</i> Job's disposition was the reverse, chap. xxix. 15. Such inhumanity would hardly be conceived possible among us. But the Idumeans were guilty of it; (Numbers xx. 18., and Isaias xxi. 14.) and if it had not been probable, Eliphaz would not have dared to speak thus. (Calmet)"
      v:008:

(Calmet) --- \"Hipparchus intimated that there would be a time when the hinges, <i>or</i> poles of heaven, would be moved out of their places.\" (Colum. i. 1.) Hebrew and Septuagint, (according to Origen's edition, ver. 13 to 16) \"he walketh about in the circuit of heaven.\" (Haydock){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Immortali ævo summa cum pace fruatur</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Semota a nostris rebus, sejunctaque longe.</i> (Lucretius){JOIN}This was the error of the Egyptians, (Aristotle, Mun. 84.) which Eliphaz unjustly lays to the charge of Job, as heretics often impute condemned tenets to Catholics.

        - 'JOB:22:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Flood.</i> Hebrew, "river," (Septuagint; Calmet) or "flood."

      v:019:
        - 'JOB:22:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Shall.</i> Septuagint, "saw." The Jews explain this of Noe, who saw the ruin of the giants with pity, mixed with joy, as he approved of the divine judgments. (Vatable, &c.) --- The just can thus rejoice, only on this account; as they would not be just if they were devoid of charity. (St. Gregory) (Psalm lvii. 11., and cvi. 42.) (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - 'JOB:22:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Their.</i> Hebrew, "our." (Calmet) --- "Whereas our substance is not cut down." (Protestants) (Haydock) --- But the Septuagint and Chaldean agree with the Vulgate, which gives a better sense. --- <i>Fire,</i> which consumed Sodom, &c. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - 'JOB:22:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Law</i> of Moses, (Rabbins) or rather (Haydock) the natural law, which teaches that God is just, and deserves to be adored. He addresses Job, as if he had acknowledged no law or restraint.'
      v:024:
        - 'JOB:22:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Gold,</i> to build and adorn thy habitation, ver. 23. Hebrew, "He will give thee gold instead of dust; (or more abundant) yea, gold of the torrents of Ophir." The Phasis is said to roll gold dust, which is of the purest kind, Genesis ii. 11. (Calmet) --- "Thou shalt lay up gold as dust, and the <i>gold</i> of Ophir, as the stones of the brooks." (Protestants) (Haydock) --- This is an exaggeration, (3 Kings x. 27.; Calmet) and a sort of proverb, intimating that strength and plenty should succeed to infirmity. The foundations should be the hard rock, instead of earth, &c.'

      v:029:
        - 'JOB:22:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Glory,</i> as the gospel declares, Matthew xxiii. 12. The Hebrew is more perplexed. "When <i>men</i> are cast down, then thou shalt say, <i>there is</i> lifting up;" (Protestants; Haydock) or "when thy eyes shall be cast down, they shall say to thee, Arise." (Calmet)'
      v:030:
        - "JOB:22:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Innocent.</i> Hebrew, \"He shall deliver even the man who is not innocent, and that for the sake of the purity of thy hands.\" (Chaldean; Junius, &c.) --- God will even spare the guilty, to manifest the regard which he has for the intercession of the saints. These interpreters have taken <i>ai</i> in the same sense as <i>ain,</i> which is the case, 1 Kings iv. 21. (Calmet) --- Others explain, \"He shall deliver the island of the innocent, and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.\" (Protestants) This also would shew the merit and protection of the saints, as a whole island may owe its safety to one of God's servants. In effect, the world stands by the prayers of the saints. (Haydock) --- All that has been said from ver. 21 tends to shew that God favours his friends; and, consequently, that he would never have punished Job, if he had not been guilty. (Calmet)"

        - 'JOB:23:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Victory.</i> Before such a judge I should hope to be acquitted. Job must have been well convinced of his innocence. For woe to man, if God treat him according to the rigour of his justice! (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "For truth and reproof are with him. But, oh! that he would bring my judgment to an end." (Haydock)'

        - 'JOB:23:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Lips,</i> given to Noe, (Genesis ix. 5.) or to Moses. This work was written by a Jew, who dresses up the sentiments of Job in his own style. The holy man was also acquainted with the Mosaic dispensation, though he was not bound to observe the ceremonial part of it. (Calmet) --- His words may, however, be verified, though he speak only of the natural law, or of that which was preserved by tradition of the patriarchs, as both proceeded from God. (Haydock) --- <i>Hid.</i> Protestants, "esteemed....more than my necessary <i>food.</i>" (Haydock) --- Septuagint agree with the Vulgate. The ancients placed in their bosom what they greatly esteemed. The Turks still use it as a pocket. (Thevenot xxii.) (Calmet)'
      v:013:

        - 'JOB:24:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Days,</i> when he will punish. (Menochius) --- They are convinced it will be sometime: while the wicked flatter themselves with impunity. (Worthington) --- Job has already shewn that his complaints had not been excessive, and that they were extorted chiefly by the dread which he had of God. He now comes to prove that he had not denied Providence. For though he asserted that the wicked were sometimes at ease, he maintained that there was another world, where all would be set to rights. Without this the book would be inexplicable. (Calmet) --- <i>Know him.</i> Septuagint, "the impious." (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - 'JOB:24:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Marks.</i> This was a heinous offence, (Deuteronomy xix. 14.) which Numa punished with death. (Halyc. i.) (Calmet) --- <i>And fed.</i> Septuagint, "and those who fed them."'
      v:004:

(Calmet) --- The Vulgate and Septuagint seem more favourable to the former supposition. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - "JOB:24:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Not,</i> is omitted by the Protestants. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, \"they reap in the field food for the cattle.\" (Calmet) --- <i>His.</i> Hebrew, \"the wicked man's vineyard.\" (Haydock) --- They do not examine whether the person whom they plunder be just or not. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"they have reaped before the season the field which was not theirs. But the poor (helpless men) have laboured in the vineyards of the wicked without wages or meat.\" (Haydock)"
      v:007:
        - 'JOB:24:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Cold.</i> Hebrew is still ambiguous, as it may be understood either of the oppressor or of the poor. The cruelty here reprobated is contrary to the law, Exodus xxii. 26. (Calmet)'
      v:008:

      v:011:
        - 'JOB:24:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Of them.</i> Hebrew, "of corn, and thirst while pressing out their olives." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "they take away the sheaf <i>from</i> the hungry, (<b>11</b>) <i>which</i> make oil within their walls, <i>and</i> tread <i>their</i> wine-presses, and suffer thirst," (Haydock) not being allowed to taste any thing, though the law of Moses would not suffer even the ox to be muzzled, Deuteronomy xxv. 4. The rich look on without pity, taking their rest at noon, amid the heaps which really belong to the poor, whom they force to labour for them.'

      v:013:
        - 'JOB:24:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Light</i> of reason and humanity. (Calmet) --- Pineda understands that they have sought darkness, (ver. 14.) to do evil. But this expression would be too harsh. (Calmet) --- Heretics, acting against their own conscience, are stricken with blindness, so that they see not the truth. (St. Gregory xvi. 26.) (Worthington)'

      v:016:
        - 'JOB:24:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Themselves.</i> The band of robbers had marked out their prey. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "In the day time they lie concealed, and know not the light." (Calmet) --- Septuagint, or rather Theodotion, from whom ver. 15 to 17., is taken, "They have sealed themselves up during the day." If we should read {GREEK:START eautois}ηαυτοισ{GREEK:END}, Hebrew <i>lamo,</i> we might translate as well "they marked them out for themselves." (Haydock) --- The adulterer had made is his arrangement with the faithless woman, when he should break into the house. (Menochius)'
      v:017:
        - 'JOB:24:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Death.</i> They are as much afraid of the light as others are of profound darkness. (Calmet) --- They dread being detected. (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - 'JOB:24:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>He is light,</i> &c. That is, the adulterer, that he may not be perceived and discovered, steps as nimbly and as light as if he were walking upon the waters. Or the sense is: he is as light, that is, as swift and nimble as the running waters. --- <i>By the way of the vineyards.</i> That is, by the way where he may meet with fruit and blessings. (Challoner) --- The wicked are always inconstant. (Calmet) (Isaias lvii. 29.) --- He deserves no temporal nor eternal happiness. If he were deprived of the former, he might perhaps endeavour to escape the torments of hell. (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - 'JOB:24:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Let.</i> Hebrew, "Drought and heat consume the snow waters; <i>so doth</i> the grave <i>those which</i> have sinned." (Protestants) (Chaldean) (Haydock) --- The wicked die quickly, and without a lingering illness. (Piscator) --- What foundation, therefore, has the hell of cold as well as of fire? says Amama. St. Jerome (in Matthew x.) observes, "We read very plainly in the Book of Job that there is a double gehenna, both of too much heat and of too much cold;" the latter occasions the gnashing of teeth, Matthew viii. (Denis the Carthusian) --- "In this world people pass through a medium or temperate state. But in hell, they pass from the excess of tormenting cold to that of burning fire; they will know no medium, because in this life they proceeded from one vice to another, even to the heat of lust. (Albertus Magnus.) (Haydock) --- Therefore they are punished with torments of a contrary nature. (Worthington) --- They go from the coldness of infidelity to the heat of heresy; (St. Gregory) from one calamity to another. (Sa) --- Septuagint, " For they have torn away the arm of the orphans. Then his <i>or</i> their sin has been remembered, and, like a dew-drop, he has disappeared. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - JOB:24:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Sweetness.</i> These will inherit him; (Haydock) for here all his pleasures will terminate. (Calmet)
      v:021:
        - 'JOB:24:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Fed the barren.</i> That is, the harlot. Or else, <i>he hath fed;</i> that is, he hath fed upon the barren; that is, the poor and desolate. (Challoner) --- He has not had posterity, but pleasure, in view, when he married. (Rabbins) --- Septuagint agree with the Vulgate. (Haydock) --- But most explain the Hebrew, "He hath oppressed the barren;" which may denote those whose husband and children have been slain. (Calmet) --- <i>No good,</i> but even dealt with them dishonestly. (Cajetan)'
      v:022:
        - "JOB:24:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Down.</i> Hebrew, \"taketh along with him his guards for his defence. He riseth and is not sure of his life,\" fearing lest his enemies may still overpower him. This is a description of the tyrant's continual anxiety. (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"And no man is sure of life,\" may intimate that the wicked put all men in danger. (Haydock) --- He who puts others in fear, must also be alarmed. (Menochius)"
      v:023:
        - 'JOB:24:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>God.</i> Septuagint, "Being sick, let him not expect to be healed, but he shall fall under sickness." Hebrew, "Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth, yet his eyes are upon their ways," (Protestants) or "he has given (Haydock) himself, <i>or</i> appointed them (guards) for his defence, and rests on them; yet his eyes," &c. He suspects the fidelity of his servants. (Calmet) --- <i>Pride.</i> Man abuseth by his free-will the time which God had allowed him to repent for former sins, Romans ii. (Worthington)'
      v:025:
        - 'JOB:24:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>And set.</i> Septuagint and Protestants, "and make my speech nothing worth." (Haydock) --- This conclusion come frequently, chap. ix. 15., and xvii. 15. Job defies his friends to shew the fallacy of his arguments, or that the wicked do not enjoy prosperity, though they may be inwardly miserable. (Calmet)'

      v:010:
        - 'JOB:26:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>End.</i> Till the end of the world, the ocean will respect these limits. (Haydock) --- The ancients looked upon it as a continual miracle that the world was not deluged, as the waters are higher than the earth, Jeremias v. 22., and Amos v. 8. (St. Basil and St. Ambrose, Hexem.) (Cicero, Nat. ii.) --- Philosophers have explained this phenomenon. But it is still certain that the power and wisdom of God preserve the equilibrium, without which all would return to the ancient chaos. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'JOB:26:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Heaven.</i> The mountains are so styled by Pindar; and the poets represent them supporting the heavens. <i>Totum ferre potest humeris minitantibus orbem.</i> (Petronius) --- Yet others understand that power which keeps all things together, (Calmet) or the angels, to whose rule the ancients attributed the celestial bodies. (St. Gregory; Ven. Bede, &c.)'
      v:012:
        - 'JOB:26:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Together,</i> at the beginning, Genesis i. 9. Hebrew, "By his strength he has divided the sea; and by his wisdom he has pierced the proud, <i>or</i> Egypt." Rahab, (Haydock) or Rachab, is often put for Egypt; (Psalm lxxxviii. 11.) and all would naturally have concluded that the fall of Pharao was pointed at, if it had not been supposed that Job lived before that event. That is, however, dubious. Isaias (li. 9.) uses the same terms in describing the fall of this tyrant. (Calmet) --- Yet the Septuagint translate, "the whale," (Haydock) or some sea monster, which God holds in subjection, (Pineda) like the weakest creature. (Haydock) --- The foaming billows (Menochius) are likewise subject to his control. (Haydock)'

(Calmet) --- <i>Artful,</i> (<i>obstetricante</i>) "being the midwife." The least things are ruled by Providence. (Worthington) --- <i>Serpent;</i> a constellation, lightning, the devil, or rather the leviathan, Isaias xxvii. 1. (Drusius) (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "by his decree, he killed the apostate dragon." (Haydock) --- But there is no need of having recourse to allegory. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - "JOB:26:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Drop.</i> This comparison is often applied to speech, Deuteronomy xxxii. 2., and Isaias lv. 10. If the little that we know of God's works give us such an exalted idea of his greatness, what should we think if we could fully comprehend his mysteries? (Calmet)"

Job grants that God generally punishes the wicked, but he maintains that he also chastises the just; and hence admonishes all to revere his judgments and wisdom, and to decline from evil; which truths must always subsist, whatever may be the conduct of Providence. (Calmet) --- <i>Parables</i> do not always imply similies, but sometimes pithy, and profound sentences, spoken by the wisest men.'

(Estius) (Calmet) --- Yet we shall examine that point later, chap. xlii. (Haydock) --- He may only mean that he is so well convinced of his innocence, that he calls God to witness it, (Calmet) and adores his ways, (Haydock) in not permitting him to appear before his tribunal, (Calmet) to justify himself; (Menochius) so the he is abandoned to the rash judgments of others, chap. xxxiv. 5.

      v:007:
        - 'JOB:27:7 | 7 | 7 | Enemy, or opponent. Hebrew, "my enemy shall be," &c.

(Houbigant) --- Job is so far from thinking riches a proof of sanctity, that he rather would wish his enemy to have them, (Menochius) as they are too frequently an incentive to sin. (Haydock)'

The moth devours another's property, like the wicked man, who lodges commodiously, though not at his own expense. --- <i>Keeper</i> of a field, or of a vineyard. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"His house has slipt away like a moth, and what he has kept (<i>or</i> his riches) like a spider.\" (Haydock) --- The moth demolishes its own house, and is then disturbed, (Menochius) or thrown with the rotten wood into the fire."

He always strives to perfect his works, and examines with care the mines which lay concealed in the most profound obscurity. (Calmet) --- Precious stones and metals lie the deepest.

(Calmet) --- Protestants, "The flood breaketh out from the inhabitants, <i>even the waters;</i> forgotten of the foot, they are dried up; they are gone away from men." Septuagint, "Sand cuts off a torrent: but those who forget the way of justice, have become infirm, and have been instable among mortals."

This country was famous for its gold. (Calmet) --- Its situation is not clearly ascertained. St. Jerome seems to have placed it in India, with Josephus, "in the golden country," now Malacca. --- <i>Stone.</i> Protestants, onyx. Hebrew <i>shoham</i> (Haydock) means, probably, the emerald, Genesis ii. 12. (Calmet) --- But these names are very indeterminate. Theodotion, from whom great part of this chapter is inserted in the Septuagint has "the gold of Ophir, and the precious onyx and sapphire." (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - 'JOB:28:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Gold.</i> This is the third time it has been mentioned, according to its different degrees of excellence. Hence it is called by the most common name, (Calmet) <i>zahab.</i> (Haydock) --- <i>Crystal</i> was formerly more "transparent" than we have it at present. (Calmet) --- <i>Zecucith</i> (Haydock) denotes something of this kind. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - "JOB:28:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Things.</i> Hebrew <i>Ramoth</i> and <i>Gabish</i> (Haydock) are terms much controverted. The first may denote the unicorns, (Deuteronomy xxxiii. 17.) and the latter the thunderbolt, or ceraunia, which were in high request. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxvii. 9. Ezechiel (xiii. 11., and xxvii. 16.) mentions the former as carried by merchants to Tyre. These stones, which fell from the sky, were used by the Parthian magi, &c., for secret purposes. They have given rise to many fabulous accounts. Those which are to be seen, are by no means beautiful. (Calmet) --- Yet if the people esteemed them, Job might well include them among other things of most value. Protestants, \"No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls, for the price of wisdom is above rubies.\" (Haydock) --- The latter part of the verse would be rather, \"the fishing for wisdom would be more difficult than that for pearls;\" (Calmet) or, \"the extraction of wisdom is above the drawing forth of <i>peninim.</i>\" (Haydock) --- The pinna is a kind of fish which is fastened to the bottom of the sea, by roots, of which the byssus was made, 1 Paralipomenon xv. 27. Pearls were commonly found in the Persian Gulf, near Idumea. The art of diving for them, and extracting them from the fish, was very difficult, but nothing in comparison with the labour requisite to discover wisdom. The ancients describe some pearls of a reddish gold colour. (Athen. iii. 13.) ( Jeremias' Lamentations iv. 7.) --- <i>Adam,</i> which is interpreted <i>red,</i> in Jeremias, means also any thing very shining; in which sense the word <i>purpureus</i> is used. (Horace vi. Ode 1.) (Bochart, Anim. p. 2, b. v. vi. (Calmet) and t. iii. 681. 91.) The opinion of this author seems preferable to that of Hutchinson and Cooke, who would translate <i>peninim</i> (Haydock) by \"loadstones or magnets,\" which the former says are like \"reddish clay,\" though they are really of a dusky iron grey, sometimes tinged with brown or red. This complexion would not be very beautiful. Yet the Nazarites are compared to <i>peninim,</i> (Lamentations iv.) and to snow, (Parkhurst) as they were of a most fair red and white, like pearls. (Haydock) --- Though the ancients seem to have been acquainted with the loadstone or magnetic needle, particularly the Phenicians (Odys. viii. 556.) and Chinese, for many ages, yet it was never so common as to form a popular comparison. Aquila renders the word in question, {GREEK:START periblepta}πηριβληπτα{GREEK:END}, \"conspicuous things;\" and pearls were certainly highly valued by the Jews, &c. Parkhurst, in <i>pone.</i> --- Theodotion, in the Septuagint, \"draw forth wisdom before the inmost things.\" --- Both these versions agree with the Vulgate, as the most precious goods are kept out of sight. (Haydock) --- Yet the deepest mines of gold do not require so much diligence and sagacity for us to discover and possess them, as wisdom does; but, in return, it will abundantly recompense the man who finds such a treasure, Ecclesiasticus vi. 19., and 24.

He continues this discourse in the two next chapters. (Calmet) --- He wishes to be restored to his former state, for his own vindication, (Haydock) and that he might exercise the works of mercy. (Ven. Bede)'

        - 'JOB:29:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Youth.</i> Hebrew, also "autumn or winter," which are seasons of repose, when people enjoy the fruits of their labours. --- <i>Tabernacle,</i> and all consulted me as an oracle. (Calmet) -- Septuagint, "when God made the visit of my house," (Haydock) and filled it with blessings, like that of Obededom, 2 Kings vi. 12.'
      v:006:
        - 'JOB:29:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Butter.</i> Many understand "cream." But butter was used to anoint the body, as well as oil. <i>Non omittendum in eo</i> (<i>butyro</i>) <i>olei vim esse, & Barbaros omnes infantesque nostros ita ungi.</i> (Pliny, [Natural History?] ix. 41.) --- <i>Oil.</i> These hyperbolical expressions denote the utmost fertility, Genesis xlix. 11. (Calmet) --- Septuagint have "milk." On all sides, Job could behold his rich pastures and cattle, (Haydock) so that he might have washed his feet in butter and milk. The rocks also were covered with olive trees; (Menochius) or the stone used for a press made the oil gush forth. (Cajetan) (Sa)'

Idumea had at first several petty kings at the same time, Genesis xxxvi. 15. (Calmet) --- But Job had several princes (ver. 9.; Haydock) under him. (Pineda)'

(Calmet) --- <i>Palm-tree.</i> Septuagint, \"But I said, my youth shall grow old like the shoot of the palm-tree: I shall live a long time.\" This is clearly the meaning of this version, (Haydock) as appears from the word {GREEK:START stelechos}στηληχοσ{GREEK:END}, \"a shoot (Calmet) or trunk.\" (Menochius) --- Yet as {GREEK:START phoinix}φοινιξ{GREEK:END}, signifies also \"a Phœnician, and the phœnix,\" some have explained this passage of the latter, which seems agreeable to the mention of a nest. Many fabulous accounts have been given of this bird, of which only one is supposed to exist at a time, rising from its parent's ashes; which, if true, (Calmet) would have been very (Haydock) beautifully applicable to a future resurrection. (St. Clement, ep. 1 Cor.; St. Ambrose, de fide Res. ii. 59, &c.) See Solin, xlii.; Tacitus, Ann. vi. This uncertain bird may have been confounded with the bird of Paradise. Palm-trees live a long time, and multiply shoots all round them surprisingly. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xiii. 4., and xvi. 44.) --- Yet the Scripture never elsewhere uses the term <em>é</em><em>ul</em> for this tree. The moderns generally translate, \"I shall multiply my days like the sand,\" which is a very common expression. (Calmet, Diss.) --- The following verse seems, however, favourable to the sense of the Septuagint and Vulgate, though the heavy nature of sand, which \"remains\" in its place, might serve to express the confidence which Job had of continuing for a long time in the midst of prosperity.

      v:024:
        - 'JOB:29:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Earth,</i> with neglect. (Calmet) --- My attendants could scarcely believe their own eyes, through joy, (Haydock) when I assumed a more familiar air with them. (Calmet) --- They still revered my authority. (Menochius)'
      v:025:
        - 'JOB:29:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>With.</i> Hebrew, "in his army, like one comforting people in mourning."

(Menochius) (Delrio, t. ii. adag. 18.) --- This comparison occurs, Micheas i. 8. Natural history does not, however, represent these animals as very plaintive. The former term may denote sea monsters, or crocodiles; <i>thannim:</i> (Septuagint, syrens) and "the daughters of the <i>yahana,</i>" signify "swans," (Isaias xiii. 21.) though commonly rendered ostriches, as they are by the Septuagint, &c.

      v:001:
        - 'JOB:31:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>I made.</i> Job is compelled to proclaim his own praises, for his vindication, as St. Paul was, being at the same time convinced that he had only done his duty, Luke xvii. 10. This is the third part of his discourse. Having given a picture of his prosperous and of his miserable condition, he observes that the latter was not inflicted in consequence of any misconduct, since he had always been attentive to avoid (Calmet) the most remote danger of offending God, or his neighbour. (Haydock) --- <i>That I.</i> Hebrew, "for why should I think upon a virgin?" (Haydock) --- Why should I expose myself, (Calmet) by indiscreet looks, (Haydock) since the passage from the eye to the heart is so easy, Ecclesiastes ii. 10. (Menochius) --- In the warfare between the flesh and the spirit, Job deemed this precaution necessary, (Worthington) and was thus preserved from carnal thoughts. (St. Gregory xx. 2.)'

        - 'JOB:31:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Eyes.</i> Sixtus V read, "If my eye hath followed my heart." (Calmet) --- Job kept the utmost restraint both upon his eyes and heart, that no evil impressions from exterior objects might cause his ruin, Numbers xv. 39. (Haydock) --- <i>Hands,</i> from presents, (Calmet) or injustice, particularly that of impurity. (Haydock)'

        - 'JOB:31:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Let.</i> Hebrew, "Let my wife grind for another, and let others bend over her," urging her to work like the meanest slave. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "Let my wife please (Grabe substitutes {GREEK:START l}λ{GREEK:END} for {GREEK:START r}ρ{GREEK:END}, and reads {GREEK:START alesai}αλησαι{GREEK:END}, grind for) another, and my little children be brought low." (Haydock) --- Yet the sense of the Vulgate is most followed, Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 21., and Lamentations v. 13. Ausonius (epig. 5) says, <i>molitur per utramque cavernam.</i> (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'JOB:31:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>This</i> adultery, to which I might have given way, and that of others with my wife, (Haydock) which would have been a requital, of which I could not indeed have complained, (Menochius) but which is nevertheless a most heinous offence. (Haydock) --- <i>Iniquity.</i> Hebrew, "a crime of judgment," or capital, Genesis xxxviii. 24. (Calmet) --- The canons of the Church (Haydock) have ranked adultery with murder and idolatry, which shews the horror in which it is held. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - "JOB:31:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Spring;</i> the children, Ecclesiasticus xxiii. 35., and Wisdom iv. 3. (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"all mine increase.\" (Haydock) --- Adulteresses were formerly consigned to the flames. The injured husband would resent the offence, and even dislike her former children. Love is also like a fire, and those who entertain it, may soon consume all their substance (Menochius) in feasting and presents. Above all, the fire of God's indignation in hell will still pursue the libidinous."
      v:013:
        - "JOB:31:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Me,</i> in private; as slaves had no redress in the common courts of judicature. We cannot but admire Job's humility, and noble sentiments of God, (Calmet) whose majesty will eclipse all human grandeur, and place the master and the servant on the same level. (St. Gregory; St. Augustine, City of God x. 25.) (Ephesians vi. 9., and Colossians iv. 1.)"
      v:016:

      v:017:
        - 'JOB:31:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Alone.</i> This was objected to St. Chrysostom. (Calmet) --- But his conduct proceeded not from pride or avarice. (Haydock) --- The ancient patriarchs delighted much in the exercise of hospitality; and Tobias (iv. 17.) exhorts his son to invite the poor. <i>Cœna,</i> or "supper," received its name from many eating "together," while people dined alone. (Plut.[Plutarch?] Sym. viii. prob. 6.)'
      v:018:
        - "JOB:31:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Womb.</i> I was of a compassionate disposition, with which I always corresponded. (St. Gregory) --- Hebrew, \"from my youth, pity (<i>ceab,</i> which Protestants translate \"as <i>with</i> a father.\" Haydock) grew up with me; and from my birth I have preserved it!\" (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"From my youth he was brought up with me, as <i>with</i> a father, and I have guided her (the widow, margin) from my mother's womb.\" Septuagint, \"I fed <i>him</i> as a father, Theodotion adds, and was <i>his</i> leader from,\" &c. It was my earliest delight to assist the afflicted orphan and widow. (Haydock)"

        - 'JOB:31:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Bear.</i> I knew that he would resent the injury, though I might, for a time, oppress the weak.'
      v:024:

      v:027:
        - 'JOB:31:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Rejoiced.</i> Hebrew and Chaldean, "been seduced" to idolatry. (Menochius) --- The worship of the sun and moon was most ancient, Ezechiel viii. 16. --- <i>Mouth,</i> to testify respect and admiration. This custom prevailed in many nations. Lucian (dial. de sacrif.) observes that this only sacrifice of the poor was not disregarded. The Syrians still extend their hands towards the altar, and then apply them to their mouth and eyes, when the body and blood of Christ are offered in the Mass. (Life of M. de Chateuil.) (Calmet) --- Septuagint, (<b>26</b>) "Do I not see the shining sun eclipsed, (Haydock) and the moon disappear, for <i>light</i> does not belong to them," but to the Creator, from whom we have every thing; (Calmet) so that we should not swell with pride. Theodotion adds, (<b>27</b>) "and if my heart was secretly deceived." Septuagint continue, "if indeed, putting my hand to my mouth, I kissed, (<b>28</b>) this would also be imputed to me as a great transgression, because I should have acted falsely before the most high God." (Haydock) --- He will admit of no rival; hence the man who admits another god, denies Him. (Menochius) --- Job repels the charge which had been indirectly brought against him. (Worthington)'
      v:029:
        - 'JOB:31:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Rejoiced.</i> Hebrew, "lifted up myself." Septuagint, "said in my heart, well, well;" <i>euge.</i> (Haydock) --- These sentiments of perfection shew that the same Spirit animated those who lived under the law of nature, as well as those who were favoured with the Mosaic or Christian dispensation. (Calmet)'
      v:030:
        - 'JOB:31:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>For.</i> Septuagint, "Then let mine ear hear my curse, and may I fall a prey to the whispers of my people."'
      v:031:
        - "JOB:31:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Filled.</i> If my servants have not testified sufficient affection for me, (Haydock) because I kept them under restraint, and obliged them to wait on my guests, (Menochius; St. Gregory) I still would not omit that duty; (ver. 32.; Haydock) or if they gave way to the greatest excesses of rage, so as to threaten to devour me, I refrained from wishing any evil to my enemy, ver. 30. (Calmet) --- Others suppose that Job's domestics urged him on to revenge, and spoke as if they were ready to eat his enemies; (Cajetan; Tirinus) while some explain the expression in a contrary sense, to denote the extreme attachment of Job's servants to his person; in which manner the Church uses it, speaking of Christ's feeding us with his own body and blood. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"If frequently my maids said who?\" &c. Hebrew, \"said not, oh! that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.\" (Protestants) (Haydock) --- Have I given my servants any reason to utter these expressions?"
      v:033:
        - 'JOB:31:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>A man.</i> Hebrew, "Adam," who, to excuse himself, threw the blame upon Eve, Genesis iii. 12. (Calmet) --- His posterity have too frequently imitated his example. The name of Adam often designates any man. (Haydock) --- It was requisite that Job should assert his sincerity, that his friends might not suppose that he was actuated by self-love or obstinacy to defend his innocence. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "If falling into an involuntary fault I hid my sin, (for I feared not the crowd of people, that I should not plead before them) but if I let the needy pass my gate with his bosom empty." Theodotion xxxv. subjoins, "who would give me a hearer? but if I did not revere the hand of the Lord." Septuagint go on, "the bond which I had against any one, if I placed on my shoulder, as a crown, and read, and did not rather tear it, and give it up, taking nothing from my debtor. If," &c., ver. 38. According to this version, Job insists on his pity for the distressed, and shews that he had no reason to fear. But the Hebrew is more conformable to the Vulgate.'
      v:034:
        - 'JOB:31:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Have not.</i> Hebrew, "that I kept silence, not going out of doors" to defend the innocent. (Haydock) --- Moses commands judges to do their duty without fear, Exodus xxiii. 2. People in such situations ought to be uninfluenced by hatred, love, &c. Cæsar says, justly, (in Sallust) "<i>qui de rebus dubiis consultant, ab odio, amicitia, ira atque misericordia vacuos esse decet. Haud facile animus verum providet, ubi illa officiunt.</i>" (Haydock)'
      v:035:
        - 'JOB:31:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>He himself.</i> Hebrew, "my adversary would write a book." His very accusation would establish my cause, provided he adhered to the truth. (Calmet) --- I would carry it about as a trophy. (Haydock) --- <i>A book.</i> The judge wrote down the sentence. Job appeals to God, and fears not being condemned.'
      v:036:
        - 'JOB:31:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Crown.</i> This shews that something pliable was then used to write on. The people of the East still lift up to their heads such letters as they respect. (Chardin Perse, p. 218.) See 4 Kings xi. 12. (Calmet)'
      v:037:
        - 'JOB:31:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>To a.</i> Hebrew, "as a prince would I approach to him," and not fear my adversary. (Haydock)'

      v:040:
        - 'JOB:31:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Thorns.</i> Protestants, "cockle." Marginal note, "loathsome weeds." (Haydock) --- The precise import of the word is not known; but it means something "stinking." (Calmet) --- Septuagint, Batos, "a briar." (Haydock) --- <i>Ended.</i> Many Latin editions omit these words with St. Gregory, &c. The old Vulgate has <i>& quieverunt verba Job,</i> as a title. (Calmet) --- Septuagint place at the beginning of the next chapter, "And Job ceased to speak. His three friends also left off contending with Job; for Job was just before them." Grabe substitutes "himself," as they were not perhaps yet convinced. (Haydock) --- Job, however, addresses his discourse no more to them, but only to God, (Calmet) acknowledging some unadvised speeches; (Worthington) or want of information. (Haydock)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - JOB:32:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Himself.</i> They thought it useless to say any more.
      v:002:
        - 'JOB:32:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Buzite,</i> a descendant of Buz, the son of Nachor, Genesis xxii. 21. (Calmet) --- <i>Of,</i> &c. Septuagint, "of the country of Hus." --- <i>Ram.</i> Chaldean, "Abraham;" (Menochius) or rather (Haydock) this is put for <i>Aram.</i> Symmachus, "Syria," 2 Paralipomenon xxii. 5. Some suppose that Eliu sprung from Aram, the son of Esron, of the tribe of Juda. Others think that (Calmet) he was the same with Balaam. (St. Jerome; Ven. Bede) --- He is never ranked among the friends of Job, as he perhaps did not come from a distance. His speech, or good intention, is not condemned by God; and Job seems to have acquiesced in what he said. (Calmet) --- This silence of the latter might rather proceed from a just (Haydock) contempt, as Eliu said nothing to the purpose; many of his observations being palpably false, and others not at all controverted. Yet with his private spirit he comes forth, not much unlike Protestants and Puritans, who pretend that they will overturn the Catholic faith by arguments which have escaped the sagacity of all preceding ages! (Worthington) --- God also did not let Eliu pass entirely unnoticed; but, in one line, showed his displeasure: (chap. xxxviii. 2.; Houbigant) as Job perhaps did likewise, by repeating the same decision, chap. xlii. 3. (Haydock) --- Eliu vainly explains why he had not spoken before. He arraigns Job for asserting his own innocence, though the holy man only maintained that he was not punished thus for his crimes, according to the laws of vindictive justice; (chap. xxvii. 2.) much less did he pretend that he was juster than God, (chap. xxxv. 2.) as his adversary asserts; taking thence occasion to praise the divine wisdom and power, as if Job had called them in question. (Calmet) --- <i>God,</i> whose eyes behold the smallest faults. (Menochius) --- Hebrew, "rather on, or (Haydock) above God." (Calmet) --- This young man, who was learned and proud, is the pattern of those hot disputants who set themselves above their elders. (St. Gregory xxiii. 2.) (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - 'JOB:32:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Found.</i> Hebrew, "produced an answer, but had <i>still</i> condemned Job;" (Haydock) or, "had made Job wicked," by giving him occasion to blaspheme, in order to defend his own righteousness. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "they took it for granted (or laid it down as a fact, {GREEK:START ethento}ηθηντο{GREEK:END}) that he was a wretch." This was not true: (Haydock) but they had also done their best to prove it. (Calmet) --- <i>Job.</i> Almost all the Rabbins assert that the original copies read <i>Jehova,</i> "the Lord;" (Haydock) and that the Masorets changed it, to avoid the apparent blasphemy; as if the three friends had rendered themselves guilty by not answering Job. But the Chaldean, &c., are silent on this head, and Abenezra allows that the change is very doubtful. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'JOB:32:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Hanging.</i> Hebrew, "I felt a reverential awe, (Septuagint, I was silent) and durst not shew," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'JOB:32:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Spirit,</i> which is communicated to the young, as well as to the old. (Menochius)'
      v:009:
        - 'JOB:32:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Aged: <u>poluchronioi</u>.</i> Septuagint <i>Rabbim,</i> "the Rabbins," (Haydock) the "great ones," placed in authority. These are not always the wisest, as understanding is the gift of God, and not attached to rank. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'JOB:32:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Disputing.</i> Hebrew, "searching out words," or arguments. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - 'JOB:32:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>None.</i> A notorious piece of arrogance, to esteem himself wiser than any of his own sect, or of his adversaries. (Worthington)'
      v:013:
        - 'JOB:32:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Man.</i> You seem to think this a convincing proof that Job is guilty: (Ven. Bede; Haydock) but it is no such thing. You would fain excuse yourselves from saying any more, for fear of causing him pain, which is already very great; and you vainly imagine that you may thus leave him to be judged by God. We must however convince Job. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'JOB:32:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>He;</i> Job, or God. I do not pretend that I have had any revelation, like Eliphas and Sophar, chap. iv. 12., and xi. 5. Job has addressed himself to you; (Calmet) but I shall not answer him as you have done. (Menochius) --- Those who neither believe Catholics, nor their own teachers, but rely on the private spirit, think that the answers which have been given to others, on the same points, do not regard them. (St. Gregory) (Worthington)'
      v:015:
        - 'JOB:32:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>They.</i> Eliu speaks thus contemptuously of the three friends, as if they had been absent. In the former verse he spoke to them: now he turns to Job. Hebrew, "they were amazed." (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - 'JOB:32:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Me.</i> And forces me to speak, Jeremias v. 24., and xx. 9. Thus Juvenal describes a great talker. <i>Tunc immensa cavi spirant mendacia folles.---Conspuiturque sinus.</i> (Sat. vi.) (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - 'JOB:32:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Vessels,</i> made of skins. Hebrew <i>oboth.</i> (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - 'JOB:32:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Man.</i> Hebrew, "give flattering titles unto man." Protestants, "I do not respect a mortal." Septuagint, (Haydock) "nothing shall make me conceal the truth: I will give things their proper names." Job seemed to him to have arrogated to himself the perfection of God, in maintaining his own innocence. (Calmet) --- He promises to stand up in defence of the Almighty, (Menochius) as his advocate. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - 'JOB:32:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Away.</i> I shall therefore speak with the utmost caution, (Haydock) as one who must shortly appear before the divine tribunal. (Menochius) --- Hebrew, "For I know not how to call things by their sirnames, (Calmet) or titles of vanity; (Haydock) <i>If I do,</i> may my Creator soon (Calmet) take me away." Septuagint, "I know not how to admire the face. If <i>it be</i> not <i>so,</i> the worms shall consume me." (Haydock)'

    commentary:
      v:003:
        - 'JOB:34:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Taste.</i> The most accurate philosophers attribute this faculty to the tongue, (Calmet) rather than to the throat, <i>guttur.</i> Hebrew, "mouth <i>or</i> palate." (Haydock) --- But Eliu speaks agreeably to the notions of the vulgar. (Calmet) --- <i>Intellectus saporum cæteris est in primâlingua, homini et in palato.</i> (Pliny, [Natural History?] xi. 37.)'
      v:005:
        - 'JOB:34:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Judgment.</i> Chap. xxvii. 2. Job had used this expression, but only to intimate that strict justice did not take place, as he thought his faults had not deserved so severe a chastisement. He did not pretend that God was unjust, or that he was quite blameless; and he had so explicitly declared his sentiments, that Eliu could not well be ignorant of them. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'JOB:34:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>There.</i> Septuagint, "he has been deceived;" {GREEK:START epseusato}ηψηυσατο{GREEK:END}. Hebrew, "I will convict my judge of lying;" or (Calmet) Protestants, "should I lie against my right?" (Haydock) --- Job, in the excess of grief, had expressed himself forcibly, chap. xix. 6., and xxiii. 7. But great deductions must be made from such hyperboles; and he had frequently praised the mercy and justice of God, and his just punishment of the wicked. He had indeed excepted himself from the number; and Eliu ought to have proved that he was wrong in this respect. But he seems to have all along evaded or mistaken the point under dispute. (Calmet) --- <i>Arrow,</i> which pierces me. (Haydock) --- The deferring judgment was not a subversion of it, as Eliu would argue, chap. xxvii. 2. (Worthington)'
      v:007:
        - "JOB:34:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>What.</i> This may be a continuation of Job's speech, who seemed to assert that none had ever been insulted like himself, nor borne it with greater patience; (chap. xvi. 4.) or Eliu reproaches him with talking scornfully to his friends and to God. (Calmet)"
      v:008:
        - 'JOB:34:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Goeth in.</i> Septuagint insert a negation, which is not found in Hebrew, Chaldean, &c. They may be understood to speak ironically. (Calmet) --- "Who committeth no sin, nor iniquity, nor has had any society with lawless people, so as to walk with wicked men." (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - "JOB:34:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>With him,</i> and strive to please him. Horrible blasphemy! of which Job was incapable: as if God were a cruel master, and threw us into despair. He had asserted that God punishes the wicked, and often treats his friends with the like severity, (chap. ix. 22., and xxx. 26.) in this world: which is very true. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"Say not that man is not visited. He is indeed visited by the Lord.\" (Haydock) --- Eliu wrests Job's words, in order that he may have something to say against him. (St. Gregory xxiv. 25.) (Worthington)"
      v:013:
        - 'JOB:34:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Earth?</i> If God cannot be unjust, hath he given the administration of the world to some other, who may have been deceived? This will not be asserted. Hebrew, "who hath visited the earth for him?" or, "who hath set him over the earth?" Is he a hired judge, who may be bribed? (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'JOB:34:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>To him,</i> and examine his conduct with rigour: there is scarcely a moment of our lives in which he would not discover a just reason for withdrawing his hand, and suffering us to die, Psalm ciii. 29. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'JOB:34:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Judgment.</i> How can we hope for redress from God, while he condemns his conduct? (Menochius) --- How can we bring Job to a sense of his duty, since he entertains such perverse notions? Hebrew, "Shall he hold dominion, who hates justice?" If God be unjust, does he deserve our adoration? (Calmet) or, "ought not the person to be put in prison, who resists judgment?" (Grotius) "If thou dost not think that He who hates crimes, and destroys the impious, is eternal and just?" (Septuagint) (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - 'JOB:34:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Who.</i> Theod.[Theodotion?] in Septuagint, "wicked is he who says to the king, thou actest contrary to the law; and to the rulers, thou most impious." (Haydock) --- <i>Apostate.</i> Hebrew, "Belial."'
      v:019:
        - 'JOB:34:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Tyrant.</i> This title is not always odious. It formerly was given to all princes, and came to be used in a bad sense, on account of the misconduct of some kings of Sicily. <i>Tyrannus a rege distat factis, non nomine.</i> (Sen.[Seneca?] Clem. xii.) --- Hebrew, "the rich more than the poor." (Haydock) --- God fears not to rebuke even the greatest princes, and dost thou dare to arraign his justice? (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - 'JOB:34:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>They,</i> the wicked, whatever may be their station in life. (Haydock) --- God takes off the tyrant (Calmet) when he least expects it, as well as the poor. (Haydock) --- <i>Troubled,</i> or make an insurrection. (Calmet) --- This often proves the ruin of tyrants. (Haydock) --- <i>Hand,</i> by the destroying angel. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - 'JOB:34:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Death,</i> or the most obscure recess. (Haydock)'
      v:023:
        - 'JOB:34:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Man.</i> Hebrew, "He will not lay upon man (Calmet) more <i>than right</i> (Protestants; Haydock) to," &c. After once passing sentence, all is over. (Calmet) --- When man has fallen into sin, he cannot with a good grace contend with God. (Calmet)'
      v:024:
        - 'JOB:34:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Stead.</i> Where are now the ancient Assyrians, Carthaginians, &c., who once made such a figure in the world? (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "glorious and sudden, and unnumbered." The next eight verses are taken from Theodotion. (Haydock)'
      v:025:
        - 'JOB:34:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Night,</i> calamities. At once they shall be oppressed. (Calmet)'
      v:026:
        - 'JOB:34:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Sight.</i> Literally, "in the place of the beholders," (Haydock) in public. (Calmet)'
      v:027:
        - "JOB:34:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>All.</i> Protestants, \"Any of.\" The wicked observe none of God's commandments as they ought. <i>He that offends in one becomes guilty of all,</i> James ii. 10."
      v:029:
        - 'JOB:34:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Condemn,</i> either God or the person whom he approves. Does not he exercise dominion over all? (Calmet) --- <i>Men.</i> Literally, "all men." Hebrew, "a man." God may destroy either a part or the whole of the creation. Sometimes whole nations or cities are cut off, and the deluge nearly swept away all mankind. (Haydock)'
      v:030:
        - 'JOB:34:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>People.</i> A hypocrite denotes one infected with all sorts of crimes. (St. Irenæus v. 24.) Such a king is sometimes given to punish a wicked people, Osee xiii. 11., and Isaias iii. 4. This sense is beautiful, and followed by the Chaldean, Septuagint, &c. We may explain the Hebrew in like manner, by neglecting the Masoretic points. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared." (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "He overturns the throne of hypocrites, on account of the scandal of the people," or "he delivers the people from servitude." The sense of the Vulgate seems preferable. (Calmet) --- Eliu insinuates that Job had been a hypocrite and an oppressor; but God exculpates him. (Worthington)'
      v:031:
        - "JOB:34:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Seeing.</i> Hebrew, \"Thou shouldst have said to the Lord, I have suffered enough: (Calmet) I will not offend.\" (Protestants) (Haydock) (Ver. 32.) --- <i>Turn.</i> He had undertaken to plead God's cause. (Calmet)"
      v:033:
        - 'JOB:34:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>It,</i> my iniquity. (Menochius) --- Will God make thee accountable for it? (Haydock) --- Yea, if thou keep silence, (Calmet) thou wilt seem to connive at it. (Haydock) --- He wishes to engage Job to speak. Hebrew may be translated many ways. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "<i>Should it be</i> according to thy mind? He will recompense it whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I. Therefore speak what thou knowest." (Haydock)'
      v:036:
        - 'JOB:34:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Father.</i> From God all the rights of a father spring, Ephesians iii. 15. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "No indeed: but learn Job, answer not like fools." Protestants, "my desire is, (marginal note, my father) that Job may be tried unto the end, because of <i>his</i> answers for the wicked." (Haydock) --- He has imitated their wicked discourses; let his chastisement deter others. (Calmet) --- The sequel seems to intimate, that Eliphaz is here styled Father. (Menochius)'
      v:037:
        - 'JOB:34:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Fast,</i> and pressed by arguments. (Menochius) (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "since he adds crime (Calmet; Protestants, rebellion) to his sin, and clappeth <i>his hands</i> among us, and multiplieth his words against the Lord." Eliu concluding that Job was obstinate, (Haydock) invites his friends to join in prayer, that he might be still more severely chastised, to make him enter into himself. Such a strange petition might possibly proceed from charity. But Eliu had given too many proofs of passion, to allow this interpretation. Had he evinced that Job as a criminal? and were not his sorrows already too great, so that he might rather have prayed that God would alleviate them, or grant him more patience?'

      v:002:
        - "JOB:35:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>God.</i> Eliu being greatly mortified at Job's silence, uses still more provoking expressions, and pretends to refute one of the holy man's assertions, which never escaped his lips, though he had complained that God treated him as an enemy, and with more severity than his sins deserved; (chap. vi. 2.; Calmet) or, that his affliction was greater than his sin, chap. xxiii. 7., &c. Eliu therefore calumniates him. (Worthington)"
      v:003:
        - 'JOB:35:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Please thee,</i> since thou punishest the guiltless. (Menochius) --- <i>If I sin.</i> Job had not said so, but it seemed to follow from his expressions, chap. xxi. 7. See chap. xxii. 3. Whether sin be committed and punished, or not, what does it <i>profit</i> God? (Calmet) --- His sovereign perfections require that he should not let sin pass unnoticed, and Job never entertained an idea to the contrary.'

(Calmet) --- He revenges the injury done by the sinner to himself, ver. 8. (St. Augustine, Conf. iii. 8.) --- The inference is therefore wrong, (Calmet) that God will not regard the sins or punishment of men, because he thence derives no profit, ver. 3. (Haydock) --- The strong sentences of Eliu agree not (or are ill-applied) to the blessed Job. (St. Gregory xxvi. 7.) (Worthington)'

        - 'JOB:35:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Knowledge.</i> I have shewn that God punishes or rewards according to our deserts, and is not indifferent about our sins. If Job have not experienced the divine bounty, it is because he has not deserved it. (Calmet)'

        - 'JOB:36:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Just.</i> Hebrew, Syriac, &c., "the just man, he will place him with kings on the throne." (Calmet) --- <i>Exalted,</i> or "extolled" for ever, if they have done well. (Worthington) --- He always disposes of kingdoms. (Menochius)'
      v:009:
        - 'JOB:36:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Violent,</i> while in power and on the throne, or because even in a private station, their will has risen up in rebellion against God. (Haydock) --- Poverty and afflictions are scourges, which are often inflicted by mercy, to bring us to a sense of our duty. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - 'JOB:36:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Ear,</i> by secret inspirations, or by the admonitions of pastors. (Calmet) --- Afflictions will also speak louder to them than any orator. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - 'JOB:36:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Folly.</i> Hebrew, "without knowledge." He speaks of princes, (Calmet) and of all the wicked, who have not known the day of their visitation. (Haydock) --- They shall suffer the punishment prepared for fools or wicked men. (Menochius)'
      v:013:
        - 'JOB:36:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Bound,</i> in misery and evil habits. They will not have recourse to God by humble prayer, though they perceive his displeasure, and design in punishing them.'
      v:014:
        - 'JOB:36:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Storm.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "in youth," (Haydock) being suddenly cut off, without having deplored the sins of their youth. (Calmet) --- <i>Effeminate.</i> Hebrew, "the consecrated" to prostitution. Eliu compares those who will not attend unto God, to the most infamous characters. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "and let their life be taken away by the angels" (Haydock) of death, chap. xxxiii. 23. (Calmet) --- He may allude to the impure Sodomites. (Menochius)'
      v:016:
        - 'JOB:36:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>He shall.</i> He would have prevented thee from falling into this irremediable distress, if thou hadst imitated the poor who trust in Him. (Calmet) --- Yea, he will still restore thee to favour, if thou wilt repent. (Haydock) --- He will fill thee with joy and plenty. (Menochius) --- <i>Foundation.</i> Hebrew, where there is not straitness. (Protestants) He would have rescued thee from distress, and set thee at large. (Haydock) --- The psalmist often speaks in the same language. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'JOB:36:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Recover.</i> Thou shalt be treated as thou hast treated others. Hebrew is not well understood. It may be, "Thou hast spoken like the impious; but judgment and justice rule. (<b>18</b>) Beware lest wrath overtake thee, so that thy prayers may not avert it. (<b>19</b>) Will He regard thy cries, thy riches, gold or strength?" (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - 'JOB:36:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Without,</i> or before thou be forced by tribulation. (Menochius) --- Lay aside <i>all</i> sentiments of pride, (St. Gregory) or keep in awe the mighty, who administer justice in thy name. (Menochius) --- Protestants, "Will he esteem thy riches? No, not gold, nor all the forces of strength." Septuagint, "Let not a willing mind incline thee <i>unjustly</i> to the prayer of the needy in distress." (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'JOB:36:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Prolong not the night,</i> &c. Prolong not causes that are brought before thee, but dispatch, by early rising, the business of them that come up to thee. (Challoner) --- Septuagint, "and all the men of power do not withdraw in the night," <i>from just punishment.</i> Theodotion adds, "that the people may come up against them," to demand vengeance. Do strict justice both to the rich and to the poor, without pity or fear. (Haydock) --- This text is very obscure; and the Hebrew may have different meanings, which do not, however, seem well connected with the rest. "Plant not after night, when people retire home;" (Calmet) or Protestants, "are cut off in their place." (Haydock) --- Delay not to banish temptations, or they will increase. (St. Gregory xxvi. 38.) (Worthington)'
      v:021:
        - 'JOB:36:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Iniquity,</i> or blaspheming, (chap. xxxiv. 37.; Menochius) and murmurs, to which alone thou hast given way since thy fall. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - 'JOB:36:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Lawgivers.</i> Hebrew <i>more,</i> "a master." In Chaldean, "a sovereign." (Grotius) Septuagint, "what potentate is against him?" (Haydock) --- What art thou, to dare thus to resist him? (Calmet) --- St. Gregory (xxvii. 1.) explains this as a prediction of Christ, "our singular lawgiver." God is most able to punish transgressors, and willing to reward those who obey his laws. (Worthington)'
      v:024:
        - 'JOB:36:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Not,</i> is omitted in Hebrew and Septuagint. "Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold;" Protestants, (Haydock) or "thou hast magnified," formerly. Do so again. --- <i>Sung.</i> The memory of great exploits was commonly preserved by canticles. (Calmet)'
      v:025:
        - 'JOB:36:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>All.</i> The rest of this chapter, and the five first verses of the next, seem to be inserted in the Septuagint from Theodotion. "Every man sees in himself how many mortals are wounded," &c. --- <i>Off,</i> in the stars, &c., or in ancient times, what wonders God has performed. (Calmet) --- The works of God are like a ladder, by which we may ascend to the knowledge of him. (Menochius) (Wisdom xiii.) (Haydock)'
      v:027:
        - 'JOB:36:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Floods.</i> God causes the water on the earth to evaporate, (Calmet) to form the clouds, (Haydock) which afterwards fall in torrents. (Menochius) --- Theodotion, "the drops of rain are numbered by him," &c., chap. xxvi. 8.'
      v:029:
        - 'JOB:36:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>If.</i> Hebrew, "Also can <i>any</i> understand the spreading out of the clouds, the elevation <i>or</i> noise of his pavilion?" (Haydock) --- What could be more magnificent than the throne of God! (Calmet)'
      v:030:
        - 'JOB:36:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Ends.</i> Literally, "the hinges," or poles, <i>cardines.</i> (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "roots;" Aristotle (Meteor. ii. 1.) and Hesoid (Theog. 727,) use the same term, (Calmet) to denote the fountains which supply the sea. (Haydock) --- Who ever discovered these deep recesses? Eliu describes a thunder-storm, when the sea is covered with darkness. He intimates that the pavilion of God, though hidden from us by the clouds, is not destitute of light. (Calmet) --- God inhabits light inaccessible. (Haydock)'
      v:031:
        - 'JOB:36:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Mortals.</i> Hebrew, "in abundance." (Haydock) --- By thunder he overwhelms many nations, while by moderate rains, he causes the earth ot fructify (Calmet) and nourish mankind. (Menochius)'
      v:032:
        - "JOB:36:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Hands,</i> or clouds, which are compared to a hand, 3 Kings xviii. 44. He opens his hand, and light appears. This expression denotes the utmost facility with which a very surprising thing is effected. --- <i>To come.</i> Hebrew, \"by this obstacle.\" He alludes to the sun's eclipse, as if God's hand covered its disk. (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"He....commandeth it <i>not to shine,</i> by <i>the cloud</i> that cometh betwixt.\""
      v:033:
        - 'JOB:36:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>To it.</i> The tabernacle of God is designed for his friends. Hebrew is very obscure. "Thunder announces the rain, and the very animals know it;" (Virgil describes their signs, Geor. i.) or "His thunder announces from above the clouds his wrath to men." (Calmet) --- "The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour."'

      v:001:
        - 'JOB:37:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>This</i> thunder, the effects of which are so terrible, that it is often styled the <i>voice</i> of God. (Calmet) (Psalm xxviii.) (Menochius) --- The consideration of rewards (chap. xxxvi. 33.) stimulates the good, while thunder strikes the heart with terror. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - 'JOB:37:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Earth.</i> Lightning appears from the east to the west, Matthew xxiv. 27.'
      v:004:
        - 'JOB:37:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>After.</i> Light travels faster than sound, (Haydock) though thunder and lightning are produced at the same instant. (Calmet) --- <i>Found out.</i> Philosophers can only propose their conjectures on the cause of thunder. This sense is confirmed by the Greek, Chaldean, &c. Hebrew may be, "he delays not;" (Calmet) --- Protestants, "he will not stay them;" (Haydock) rain commonly falling soon after thunder. As the latter is occasioned by the collision of clouds, when they come to a certain distance from the earth, the heat causes them to dissolve into showers, which augment at each crack. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "For he has done great things, which we have not understood." This is connected with chap. xxxvi. 24. Then we read, (ver. 7.) "that man may know his own weakness." All the intermediate verses have been supplied by Origen from Theodotion, or others. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - "JOB:37:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>He sealed up,</i> &c. When he sends <i>those showers of his strength;</i> that is, those storms of rain, <i>he seals up;</i> that is, he shuts up the hands of men from their usual work abroad, and confines them within doors, to consider <i>his</i> works; or to forecast <i>their</i> works; that is, what they themselves are to do. (Challoner) --- We are all the servants of God. He marks us in the hand, as such, Isaias xliv. 5., and Ezechiel ix. 6., and Apocalypse xiii. 6. The Romans marked soldiers with a hot iron in the hands. (Veget. i. 8.) --- The abettors of chiromancy have hence vainly pretended that they can discover each person's future in the lineaments of his hands. (Calmet)"
      v:008:
        - JOB:37:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Den.</i> Foreseeing the tempest and retreating for shelter.
      v:009:
        - 'JOB:37:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Parts.</i> The south, (chap. ix. 9.) whence storms commonly came in that country, (Calmet) from the sea or desert of Idumea. (Haydock) (Psalm lxxvii. 26., and Zacharias ix. 14., and Isaias xxi. 1.) --- <i>North</i> wind or pole. (Worthington) --- Yet the south seems to be designated; (ver. 17., and chap. xxxviii. 32.) though cold comes from the north, in Idumea as well as here. (Calmet) --- <i>Mezarim,</i> is rendered by Protestants "north." Marginal note, "scattering <i>winds.</i>" Septuagint {GREEK:START akroterion}ακροτηριον{GREEK:END}, "summits" of mountains.'
      v:010:
        - JOB:37:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Abundantly.</i> He causes it to freeze or rain at pleasure. (Haydock) (Psalm cxlvii. 17.) (Menochius)
      v:011:
        - 'JOB:37:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Corn</i> requires rain. (Haydock) --- <i>Light.</i> As they are transparent, they do not hinder the sun from appearing. Hebrew, "the brightness of the sky disperses the clouds, and the clouds shed their light" in the rainbow, (ver. 15.; Grotius) or lightning. (Junius; Calmet; Menochius) --- Protestants, "Also by watering, he wearieth the thick cloud, he scattereth his bright cloud, (<b>12</b>) and it is turned round about by his counsels, that they may do whatsoever," &c. God prohibits or gives rain. (Haydock) --- Nothing is left to chance. (Calmet) --- He directeth the clouds as a master does his ship. (Worthington)'
      v:013:
        - 'JOB:37:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Tribe.</i> Hebrew also, "for correction." (Haydock) (Amos iv. 7.) --- <i>Land</i> of promise, Psalm lxvii. 10.'
      v:015:
        - 'JOB:37:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Light:</i> the rain-bow, according to the best interpreters; or the lightning. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'JOB:37:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Paths.</i> Hebrew, "the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of Him whose knowledge is perfect?" chap. xxxvi. 4. Dost thou know what suspends the heavy clouds in the air? (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - "JOB:37:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Are.</i> Hebrew, \"How thy,\" &c. It is also beyond thy comprehension, why thou shouldst be too hot when the south winds blows (Haydock) moderately, though tempests generally proceed from the same quarter, ver. 9. If thou art in the dark respecting these things, which thou feelest, how canst thou pretend to fathom and condemn the counsels of God? (Calmet) --- Job was far from doing either. His friends rather undertook to explain God's reasons for punishing thus his servants, which Job acknowledged was to him a mystery, (Haydock) till God had enlightened him, chap. xxii. 3. (Houbigant)"
      v:018:
        - 'JOB:37:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Brass.</i> Hebrew, "Hast thou with him stretched out (or beaten, as brass, <i>tarkiang;</i> which word Moses uses for the firmament) the heavens, which are as solid (Chaldean, and like) a molten looking-glass?" which was formerly made of metal, Exodus xxxviii. 8. The Hebrews looked upon the sky as a sheet of brass; and the poets speak of the brazen heaven. (Pindar. Nem. vi.; Homer, Iliad {GREEK:START A}Α{GREEK:END}.)'
      v:019:
        - 'JOB:37:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Darkness.</i> Thou who art so learned, give us some information, what we may blame in the works of God. Cutting irony! (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - "JOB:37:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>He shall be swallowed up.</i> All that man can say, when he speaks of God, is so little and inconsiderable in comparison with the subject, that man is lost, and as it were swallowed up in so immense an ocean. (Challoner) --- The man who should dare to mention what I could reprehend in God's works, would soon be overwhelmed with majesty. (Calmet) --- Alphonsus IX, king of Leon, (the year of our Lord 1252) surnamed \"the wise and the astronomer,\" said \"he could have given some good advice respecting the motions of the stars, if he had been consulted by God;\" meaning to ridicule some vain systems of philosophers, then in vogue. (Dict. 1774.) (Haydock)"
      v:021:
        - 'JOB:37:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Light;</i> being hindered by the clouds, and dazzled when they are removed. Yet we presume to judge of the secrets of Providence! (Calmet) --- <i>Away.</i> As there is a constant vicissitude of these things, so there is of happiness and misery. (Menochius) --- Septuagint, "For the light is not seen by all. It is refulgent in beauties, as that which comes thence upon the clouds." If, therefore, this light does not pervade all places, why should we wonder that all do not understand the ways of God? (Haydock)'
      v:022:
        - 'JOB:37:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Gold.</i> Septuagint, "from the north, gold-coloured clouds. Above these, great is the praise and honour of the Almighty." (Haydock) --- When the wind blows, the clouds are dispersed, and the sky appears serene. Each country has its peculiar advantages. In the north, Ophir, &c., may boast of gold: but what ought to be most conspicuous in the praises given to God, is an humble <i>fear.</i> Pindar begins his Olympic Odes somewhat in the same style. (Calmet) --- "Water is excellent, and gold....But if, dear heart, thou wilt sing of games, regard no other star....as brighter than the sun....nor shall we celebrate any game more excellent than that of Olympia." (Haydock) --- God disposes of all things as he pleases. He makes the golden day succeed a tempest. But it is our duty to praise him with awe, whatever he may ordain. This is the epilogue. (Pineda) --- Man must praise God with fear, as he cannot do it sufficiently. (Worthington)'
      v:023:
        - 'JOB:37:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Worthily.</i> Hebrew, "the Almighty, we cannot find him out," (Haydock) or comprehend his nature or mysteries. (Calmet)'
      v:024:
        - "JOB:37:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Fear him,</i> and receive with respect whatever he shall appoint. (Haydock) --- <i>And all.</i> Hebrew, \"he fears not any that are wise of heart.\" He knows that the most intelligent (Calmet) must confess their ignorance, when they attempt to examine his divine nature. Simonides being desired by Hiero to express his sentiments on this subject, always requested more time to consider of it. <i>Quia, inquit, res videtur mihi tanto obscurior, quanto diutius eam considero.</i> (Cicero, Nat. i. 60. Selectæ e Prof. i. 3.) --- \"With thee (says St. Augustine, Conf. i. 6.) stand the causes of all instable things,\" &c. (Haydock) --- Those who are really wise, will therefore adore God's judgments in silence, while the presumptuous will be forced to yield. This is the excellent conclusion of all that had been said. (Pineda) --- The sentence is beautiful, but ill-applied (Haydock) to Job. (Philip) See Proverbs iii. 7. (Haydock) --- He convinced the other three with sound arguments, \"and this last and most arrogant disputant with silence.\" (Worthington)"

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JOB:38:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Then.</i> Septuagint, "After Eliu had ceased to speak." (Haydock) --- <i>Lord.</i> That is, an angel speaking in the name of the Lord. (Challoner) --- The name Jehova (Haydock) here occurs, though it never does in the speeches; whence many have inferred that the Lord spoke in person; which argument, however, is not conclusive; and that this work was written after the apparition in the burning bush. (Calmet) --- The Hebrew edition would at least be given after that event. --- <i>Whirlwind,</i> designed to strike the senses, (Haydock) and to represent the distressed condition of Job. (Pineda) --- This awful appearance imposed silence upon all. (Haydock) --- Some think that a time was allowed for reflection and repentance, before God passed sentence; but the Septuagint, &c., seem to suppose that the cause was decided as soon as Eliu had ended his discourse. (Calmet) --- God discusses the controversy, and gives sentence in favour of Job. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - "JOB:38:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Words.</i> Many explain this as a condemnation (Calmet) of the last speaker, (Du Hamel) who would otherwise pass without any reproach, (Haydock) though he had spoken with less reserve than the rest. (Calmet) --- Pineda allows that this opinion is very plausible; but he thinks that Job himself is reprehended, not for any grievous offence, but for indiscreet expressions, chap. xli. The context also seems to require this, as Job takes it to himself, chap. xxxix. 33. (Calmet) --- The change of persons might rather imply the contrary: <i>Who is this?</i> Eliu. <b>3.</b> <i>Gird up thy loins.</i> Job. (Haydock) --- Can we admit that the devil got the victory; or, that God falsely declared that Job had spoken <i>right?</i> chap. xlii. (Houbigant) --- Did not the latter maintain the truth with greatest zeal, while his friends certainly <i>mixed unskilful</i> words or inferences with <i>sentences</i> of the greatest consequence? <i>His face I will accept, that</i> your <i>folly be not imputed to you; for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath,</i> chap. xlii. 8. Hebrew, \"Who is this that darkeneth counsel, by words without knowledge?\" (Protestants) \"Who is the who concealeth counsel from me, keeping words in his heart, and thinketh to hide from me?\" (Septuagint) Eliu pretended to explain the counsels of God, and perhaps did not utter all that he had in his mind; but God condemns the very harbouring of thoughts, which are contrary to truth and justice. (Haydock) --- Job's friends laboured under great prejudices, and condemned him without cause, (Calmet) thinking that they were doing a service to God, like those who put the apostles to death, and persecuted Catholics on account of their religion. But this plea will not excuse them. Here one line suffices to refute the long harangue (Haydock) of Eliu; (St. Gregory; Ven. Bede; Tirinus, &c.) though we have observed, (Haydock) some understand the words to be addressed to Job, as a rebuke for his too warm expressions. (St. Chrysostom; St. Augustine, &c.) (Calmet) --- The remainder of the discourse is designed for Job's instruction. (Haydock) --- <i>Hoc</i> (Eliu) <i>despecto ad erudiendum Job verba vertuntur.</i> (St. Gregory)"
      v:003:
        - 'JOB:38:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Loins,</i> like one about to engage in an arduous task, (Haydock) or journey, (Calmet) to explore the ways of divine Providence. (Haydock) --- <i>Answer</i> my reasons, if thou art able. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "make me know." (Haydock) --- Only the Creator hath perfect knowledge of all his works, as may appear by induction or example: <b>1.</b> of inanimate; <b>2.</b> of living things, ver. 39. (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - 'JOB:38:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Foundations.</i> The Hebrews placed the earth in the centre of the universe, resting upon nothing, (chap. xxvi. 7., and xxxvi. 30.) or upon itself. See Hesiod, Theog. 325. (Calmet) --- These questions seem intended to shew, that if God has created all things for man, he will not surely neglect to watch over him. (Menochius)'
      v:005:
        - 'JOB:38:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Upon it.</i> He speaks of the world as of a vast house, (Calmet) or palace, (Menochius) in which the Architect has shewn his art. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - "JOB:38:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Sons.</i> Septuagint, \"all my angels.\" Hence it appears that the angels were among the first of God's works, formed probably at the same time with the heavens, (Calmet) or light, Genesis i. 3. (Haydock) --- The praise of the stars is figurative, (Calmet) as they tend to raise our hearts to God by their beauty, (Haydock) whereas that of the angels is real. (Calmet)"
      v:008:
        - 'JOB:38:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Shut.</i> Hebrew also, (Haydock) "facilitated the birth of the sea," as a midwife. (Grotius) (Calmet) --- <i>Forth.</i> Septuagint, "raged." (Haydock) --- God represents the waters ready to overwhelm all when first produced out of nothing, if he had not shut them up in the abyss, like a child in a cradle, or a wild beast in its den, ver. 10. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - "JOB:38:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Mist.</i> So Moses says darkness was on the face of the abyss. Obscurity covered it, as swaddling bands do a child's body. (Calmet)"
      v:010:
        - 'JOB:38:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Set.</i> Protestants, "brake up for it my decreed place." Marginal note, "established my decree upon it;" (Haydock) or, "I gave order to break it," against the shore, Jeremias v. 22., and Amos v. 8.'
      v:012:
        - 'JOB:38:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Place.</i> Thou art but as yesterday: where is thy power? (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - 'JOB:38:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>And didst.</i> Some explain Hebrew, "that it (Aurora) might spread at once to the extremities of the earth. Then the wicked flee before it;" as they hate the light, chap. xxxiv. 26., and John iii. 20. (Calmet) --- Septuagint and Protestants may be understood in this sense. (Haydock) --- Allusion may also be made to the shaking of a sieve, to separate the wheat from the chaff; (Amos ix. 9., and Luke xxii. 31.; Calmet) or of a carpet, to clean it from the dust. (Du Hamel) --- Did God ask thee to help him to exterminate the wicked? The short digression in these three verses, shews the punishment exercised on offenders. It is not contrary to the true spirit of poetry. (Menochius)'
      v:014:
        - 'JOB:38:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Seal.</i> Men, formed to the image of God, shall die; and others shall be place in their stead, (Menochius) with as much ease as an impression is made upon clay. (Haydock) --- <i>Garment.</i> The body seems to be the clothing of the soul, and will be changed, Psalm ci. 27. (Menochius) --- Chaldean, "their form will be changed to clay, and they shall resemble a tattered garment." Hebrew, "their seal shall change like clay," &c. All their glory shall perish. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "hast thou taken earth <i>or</i> clay, and formed a living creature, and endued it with speech on the earth?" Is man the workd of thy hands? (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - 'JOB:38:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Doors?</i> Septuagint, "through fear; or have the porters of hell flown away at thy sight?" (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - 'JOB:38:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Darkness.</i> The poetical style of this book represents these things as real beings, in the same manner (Calmet) as the <i>house,</i> (ver. 20) or palace of the sun, &c., are described by the ancients. (Haydock)'
      v:023:
        - 'JOB:38:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>War.</i> Hail, &c., are like the arrows of God, Jeremias x. 13., and l. 25. (Calmet)'
      v:024:
        - 'JOB:38:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Heat.</i> Hebrew <i>kadim,</i> (Haydock) the "east." Septuagint, "south wind." Perhaps the east winds produced the same bad effects in Egypt, as the south wind did in Judea; (Calmet) or this noxious burning wind might proceed from the south-eastern point of both countries. (Haydock)'
      v:025:
        - 'JOB:38:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Noisy.</i> Hebrew, "for lightning, which accompanies thunder?" By these questions, respecting things which to man are impossible, and many inexplicable, God humbles (Calmet) the pride of the human heart. (Haydock)'
      v:026:
        - 'JOB:38:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Dwelleth.</i> This shews the magnificence of God, (Menochius) at least. (Haydock)'
      v:031:
        - 'JOB:38:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Pleiades.</i> The seven stars. --- <i>Arcturus.</i> A bright star in the north. (Challoner) --- The same terms occur, and are explained, chap. ix. 9. (Haydock)'
      v:032:
        - 'JOB:38:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Day-star.</i> Hebrew <i>mazzaroth,</i> (Haydock) corresponds with the "inner parts of the south;" (chap. ix. 9) though some translate, "the signs of the zodiac, or the influences," &c. The antarctic constellations could not be seen in Idumea, while those at the north pole (Calmet) must appear to those who live on that side of the line, (Haydock) as the perpetual sentinels of the sky. --- <i>Evening-star.</i> Hebrew, "Wilt thou make <i>hayish</i> and her daughters go to rest?" These indicate the arctic stars. Here two quite opposite stars are meant; (Calmet) though (Haydock) with us the evening and morning star be the same, being so styled according as it appears after or before the sun. (Menochius) --- Protestants, "Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth (Septuagint also retain the original term, {GREEK:START Mazouroth}Μαζουροθ{GREEK:END}) in his season, or canst thou guide Arcturus, with his sons?" The former term signifies things "scattered," the planets, (Haydock) or "the grains of gross air dispersed" to all the extremities, which returning to the centre, occasion cold, chap. xxxvii. 9. (Parkhurst)'
      v:033:
        - 'JOB:38:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Reason.</i> Hebrew, "dominion," (Haydock) or influence upon the earth. Mathematicians thought they had discovered these laws, and the number of the stars; but daily experience evinces their error. (Menochius)'
      v:034:
        - 'JOB:38:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Voice,</i> to mimic the thunder of God, (Calmet) or to order it to rain. (Haydock)'
      v:036:
        - 'JOB:38:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Understanding.</i> That is, to distinguish the hours of the night. (Challoner) --- Septuagint, "Who gave to women the knowledge of the loom, and the art of embroidering?" (Haydock) --- It was the part of women to weave, as appears from the conduct of queen Penelope. But the best interpreters translate, "Who has placed wisdom in the reins, or who hath given understanding to the heart," <i>or</i> soul? (Calmet) --- God gives wisdom to man, and an instinct to cocks, (Haydock) or the skill, of which the former is deprived, (Worthington) to know the approach of day. (Du Hamel)'
      v:037:
        - 'JOB:38:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Sleep.</i> The ancients have celebrated this harmony. (Cic.[Cicero?] Somn. Scip.) --- Septuagint, "Who numbereth the clouds in wisdom, or hath bent the sky down to the earth?" Protestants, "or who can stay the bottles of heaven?" (Haydock) --- Canst thou cause it to rain, or to be fair? (Calmet) or make the celestial bodies (Haydock) rest from motion? (Worthington)'
      v:038:
        - 'JOB:38:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Together.</i> When was the water separated from the earth? (Haydock) --- Where wast thou when I gave consistency to the rocks? (Calmet)'
      v:039:
        - "JOB:38:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>And satisfy.</i> Septuagint, \"or fill the souls of the dragons?\" (Haydock) --- Here Hebrew editions commence the following chapter, (Calmet) and are followed by Protestants (Haydock) and others, as the proof of God's superior knowledge begins to be established by the consideration of various animals. (Worthington)"
      v:041:
        - 'JOB:38:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Wandering.</i> Sixtus V reads <i>vagientes,</i> (Calmet) "crying like children." (Haydock) --- The ravens presently drive their young away to seek for fresh habitations. (Pliny, [Natural History?] x. 12.) (Psalm cxlvi. 9.) (Calmet) --- If God provide for such creatures, He will shew still greater attention to man. (Worthington)'

(Calmet) --- When it is hunted, it hides its head only, as if this would be a sufficient defence, (Pliny, [Natural History?] x. 1.) and is taken alive by a man, clothed in the skin of an ostrich, who moves the head with his hand. (Strabo xvi.) --- All which proves its stupidity. (Calmet)'

        - 'JOB:39:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>High.</i> With her head erect, the ostrich is taller than a man on horseback. (Pliny x. 1.) --- Its wings are used like sails, and enable it to run as fast as many birds can fly, (Calmet0 while it hurls stones at the pursuer with its feet, so as frequently to kill them. (Diodorus ii.) --- <i>Rider,</i> as they can travel with equal speed. (Menochius) (Ver. 13.) --- Adamson (Senegal) placed two negroes on one, and testified that it still went faster than any English horse. (Haydock)'

(Ælian x. 14.) --- Hence the Egyptians consecrated this bird to the sun. (Calmet) --- The eagle is of the same species, and has the same properties.

      v:031:
        - "JOB:39:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Went on.</i> Septuagint, \"answered.\" This was the conclusion drawn from the display of God's wonderful works. If we cannot sufficiently admire them, why should we be so much surprised, as Job acknowledged he was, at the ways of Providence? It would, therefore, be better to keep silence, ver. 35. (Haydock)"

      v:034:
        - "JOB:39:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Spoken inconsiderately.</i> If we discuss all Job's words, (saith St. Gregory) we shall find nothing impious spoken; as may be gathered from the words of the Lord himself; (chap. xlii. ver. 7, 8.) but what was reprehensible in him was the manner of expressing himself at times, speaking too much of his own affliction, and too little of God's goodness towards him, which here he acknowledges as <i>inconsiderate,</i> (Challoner) or rather as the effect of inculpable ignorance; (Haydock) as the present order of things being then novel, confounded the sagacity both of Job and of his friends. The wicked had formerly been the victims of justice, but henceforth, says Job, (Hebrew) \"if it shall not be so, who can convince me of lying?\" (Chap. xxiv. 25.) Yet he did not perfectly discern the intention of God, in abandoning his servants to the power of satan, till the Lord himself had explained it in the parables of behemoth and leviathan. Then Job testified his conviction and entire submission, chap. xlii. 5. Houbigant observes that the Vulgate is perhaps less accurate here, and [in] chap. xlii. 3., as God exculpates Job, ver. 8. Yet the latter might entertain fear at least, of having exceeded in words, after such pungent questions. We may translate, (Haydock) Hebrew, \"Behold I am vile, (Calmet) what shall I answer thee?\" (Protestant) or Septuagint, \"Why am I still judged, being admonished and rebuke by the Lord, hearing such things?\" (Grabe, after Origen, marks with an obel what follows, as not found in Hebrew) \"I, who am nothing, what answer shall I then give to these things?\" (Haydock) --- If we discuss all Job's speeches, we find nothing spoken wickedly, but only a species of pride, in talking too much of his sufferings, and too little of God's goodness and justice, which he ought to have confessed. (St. Gregory xxxii. 3.) (Worthington)"
      v:035:
        - 'JOB:39:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>One.</i> Septuagint, "Once I have spoken, but I will not add again." (Haydock) --- I have spoken too much, but I will be more cautious. Hebrew, "I have spoken one thing, and I will not answer; (Calmet) yea, two things, but I will go no farther." Many of my observations may be too strong, as I am not perfectly aware what may be the designs of Providence in my regard. (Haydock)'

    commentary:
      v:003:
        - 'JOB:40:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Judgment.</i> Job had frequently acknowledged that God could not be in the wrong. But he had expressed himself in too forcible language, of which God makes him, as it were, ashamed. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "rejectest thou not my decision? yea, dost thou think that I have judged thee in a different manner, in order that thou mayst appear just?" (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - 'JOB:40:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Scatter.</i> Septuagint is shorter: (Calmet) "Send angels <i>or</i> messengers in wrath, and humble every insulting person. <b>7.</b> Extinguish the proud, destroy the wicked at once. <b>8.</b> Hide them in the earth together, and fill their faces with shame." (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'JOB:40:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Pit,</i> or grave. Cause the earth to swallow them up, and I will confess thy power. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - "JOB:40:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Behemoth;</i> the elephant, (Challoner) \"as some think.\" (Protestants' marginal note) (Haydock) --- This is the most common opinion, though Sanchez explains it of the bull; and Bochart, after Beza and Diodati, declares in favour of the hippopotamus, (Calmet) or \"river horse.\" Parkhurst even thinks Bochart has proved this \"to a demonstration.\" The sea or river horse, (Haydock) is an amphibious animal, (Calmet) found in the Nile and Indus, and said to have the feet of an ox and the teeth of a boar, but not quite so sharp, while the neighing, back, mane, and tail, resemble those of a horse. Its hide, when dry, is said to resist even a musket-ball. (Button; Dict.) --- We find a good description of this animal in Watson, p. 91. But the plural <i>Bemoth,</i> female (Haydock) \"beasts,\" seems more applicable to the elephant, on account of its great size, as it is designated by {GREEK:START theria}θηρια{GREEK:END}, or <i>Bellua,</i> by the Greek and Roman authors. (Suidas.) (1 Machabees vi. 35.) (Pliny, [Natural History?] viii. 3.) --- It may have received the name of elephant from (Calmet) <i>alp,</i> \"to lead or teach,\" (Haydock) on account of its great sagacity and strength. All that Job says of behemoth, may be well explained of it. The Fathers have supposed, that the devil is meant: but we stick to the literal sense. (Calmet) --- He may, however, (Haydock) have been hinted at by this name, (Worthington) as well as by that of leviathan. (Houbigant) --- <i>With thee,</i> on the same day, or as well as thee. (Amama) --- <i>Grass.</i> The elephant does so, and is by no means savage. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"Yet, behold, near thee wild beasts, equal to oxen, eat grass.\" (Haydock) --- The spontaneous productions of the earth, and branches of trees, afford the principal sustenance to satisfy the prodigious stomach of the elephant; which is frequently twelve feet high, and of a dark colour. A sword can scarcely pierce it in the back or sides. It has small eyes, eight teeth, and two tusks; which last are sometimes above a hundred weight each, and being cast every tenth year, (Button) afford ivory. The proboscis serves it instead of hands to collect the smallest grain, or to defend itself. (Haydock) --- The female goes with young a whole year, and the duration of its life is generally supposed to be above a hundred. Elephants inhabit warm climates, and were formerly much used in war, to carry wooden towers, from which twenty, or even thirty, men might throw darts, 1 Machabees vi. 37. (Button.) --- If this greatest and most temperate of all beasts be overcome by the unicorn, or led by the nose, how much more will God enable man to overcome the devil? (Worthington)"
      v:011:
        - 'JOB:40:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Loins.</i> The towers were fastened here by an iron chain. --- <i>Belly.</i> Yet it is nowhere so easily wounded, 1 Machabees vi. 45. (Pliny, viii. 20.) --- Hence some would translate Hebrew, "and its pain in the belly," (Calmet) as it is only subject to an inflammation and flux; <i>profluvium alvi.</i> (Pliny) (Ælian xvii. 44.) --- But the original rather denotes the parts of generation, which lie concealed, (Aristotle, anim. ii. 1., and v. 2.) and are styled the strength, Genesis xlix. 3., and Deuteronomy xxi. 17.'
      v:012:
        - 'JOB:40:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Tail,</i> which is very small, and without hair. (Calmet) --- Vavassor rather thinks "the trunk" is meant. (Du Hamel)'
      v:013:
        - 'JOB:40:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Gristle.</i> Hebrew again, "bones." (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "back-bone, like cast iron."'
      v:014:
        - 'JOB:40:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Beginning,</i> or prince. (Haydock) --- The elephant may be considered as the king of beasts for strength, agility, gratitude, longevity, &c. None approaches so near to man. (Pliny viii. 1.; Calmet; Lipsius, 1 ep. 50.; Amama) --- <i>Sword;</i> which is the rhinoceros, killing the elephant under the belly with its horn; (Pliny viii. 20.; Grotius) or God seems to have entrusted his sword to the elephant, for the destruction of his enemies. Nothing can withstand its fury, as it overturns houses and trees with its trunk. (Junius) (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - 'JOB:40:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Play.</i> No animal is of a milder nature. It never attacks, unless in its own defence. When a crowd of other beasts obstruct its passage, it removes them quietly with its proboscis. (Pliny vi. 9., &c.)'
      v:016:
        - 'JOB:40:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Places,</i> insomuch that Ælian (iv. 24.) styles it a "beast of the marshes." It is fabulous that it is forced to sleep against a tree, as if it could not rise without much difficulty. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, (<b>14</b>) "This is the beginning or chief ({GREEK:START arche}αρχη{GREEK:END}) of the creation of the Lord, being made for his angels to play with, <i>or</i> beat. Departing to the craggy rock, it has made sport for the quadrupeds in the field. It sleepeth under all sorts of trees; near the reed and papyrus, and the boutomon, <i>or</i> ox-herb." (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - 'JOB:40:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Wonder.</i> Hebrew, "make haste," taking time to render it muddy. (Ælian xiv. 44.) --- It can drink a great deal at once, and then abstain for a week. (Calmet) --- <i>Run.</i> Hebrew, "he may draw." Septuagint, "may knock at his mouth," (Haydock) in vain, (Calmet) as long as it can breathe by holding by holding its trunk out of the water. (Aristotle ix. 46.) --- Theo.[Theodotion?] in the Septuagint, "If there should be an inundation, it shall not perceive. It confideth that, <i>or</i> when, the Jordan shall knock at its mouth. He shall take it by its eye; laying snares, he shall bore <b>[</b>its<b>]</b> nose." (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - 'JOB:40:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Stakes.</i> Serpents attack the eyes of the elephant, and sometimes drag it by the trunk into the deep, where it is drowned. (Pliny viii. 12.; Solin xxxviii.) --- Others read with an interrogation: "Shall one take?" &c. Will any one dare to attack it openly? The elephant is taken by stratagem, either in pits covered with a little earth, or by a tame elephant in an inclosure, and (Calmet) lying on her hack to receive the male. (Aristotle, anim. v. 2.) --- When he has entered, the gate is shut, and the animal is tamed by hunger; being thus taken by his eyes, Judith x. 17. Chaldean, "They pierce his nostrils with bands." Thus other animals are led about, (ver. 21) and the elephant might be so treated in those days; though of this we have no account. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "his nose pierceth through snares;" or marginal note, "will any bore his nose with a gin?" Here they conclude this chapter, which commences chap. xxxix. 31., in Hebrew. But the Septuagint agree with us. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - "JOB:40:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Leviathan:</i> the whale, or some sea monster. (Challoner) --- Protestants' marginal note, \"or a whirlpool.\" (Haydock) --- But some animal is designated; and Bochart understands the crocodile, which agrees very well with the context. The Thalmudists also say that the calbish is a small fish, which gets into the throat of the leviathan. They mean probably the ichneumon, which kills the crocodile by that means. Leviathan, \"the winding serpent,\" (Calmet) often denotes the dragon or crocodile, (Psalm ciii. 26., and Isaias xxvii. 1.) which frequents the Nile. (Haydock) --- It can live as well by land as under water, (Watson, p. 293) and hence may be translated, (Haydock) \"the coupled dragon.\" (Parkhurst) --- Moses mentions the choled, (Leviticus xi. 29.) which the Septuagint and most others translate, \"the land crocodile:\" but what could induce the Protestants \"to render it tortoise, we are at a loss to determine.\" Crocodiles lay about sixty eggs, like those of geese, in the sand, the warmth of which soon hatches them. Their bodies are covered with scales, which are scarcely penetrable, except under the belly; and they are between twenty and thirty feet in length, running very fast, straight forward, though their feet be short, and they cannot turn easily. They have several rows of sharp teeth, which enter one within another, and their throat is very wide. (Button.) --- The same word may however denote whales, (Parkhurst) which are the greatest fishes with which man is acquainted. (Haydock) --- They may also be styled coupled dragons, because many smaller fishes accompany them, and they are well protected by scales, &c. (Menochius) --- This huge fish, perhaps the whale, representing the devil, is subject to God. (Worthington) --- <i>Cord.</i> The crocodile may be taken, but with the utmost hazard; though the Tentyrites attacked it without fear, chap. iii. 8. Herodotus (ii. 70.) says it may be caught with a hook, baited with hog's flesh, while the fisher has a pig grunting, at which the crocodile comes open-mouthed. Having swallowed the hook, it is drawn to land, and its small eyes being filled with dirt it is easily slain. But the method was not yet invented, or was deemed too rash in Job's days."
      v:021:
        - 'JOB:40:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Buckle.</i> Literally, "bracelet," (<i>armilla.</i>; Haydock) or ring. Horses were thus ornamented, (Virgil vii. 7.) and other beasts led about. But this fierce animal could not be tamed. Hebrew, "Wilt thou put a rush through its gills, <i>or</i> nose, or pierce its jaw with a thorn?" like those little fishes which are thus brought fresh to market. (Calmet)'

(Calmet) --- <i>Frigidus in pratis cantando rumpitur anguis.</i> (Virgil, Ec. viii.) --- Septuagint, "the nations." --- <i>Merchants.</i> Septuagint, "the generation of the Phœnicians (Hebrew) of Chanaan, (Haydock) famous for merchandise, (Calmet) insomuch that the name is used for any merchant. (Haydock) --- Will they salt the crocodile for sale? (Calmet) --- Its flesh was much liked. (Herodotus, &c.)'
      v:026:

(Calmet) --- Protestants, "Canst thou fill his skin with barbed prongs, (for which they have now irons) or his head with fish spears?" --- But this is hardly the meaning of the original, chap. xli. 6. Hebrew, "wilt thou fill tents with its skin, or the fish net, with its head?" to catch other fish, or to cover thy tent? &c. The skin is very hard, except under the belly. (Calmet) --- One defended itself against 36 men, who fired at it six times in vain. (Herera.) --- Septuagint, "a whole fleet collected would not carry off the skin of its tail." (Haydock) --- They seem to speak of the whale. (Calmet) --- Theodotion adds, "and its head in fisher boats." (Haydock)'

(<b>28.</b>) Hast thou not seen it, nor been astonished at what has been said?" (Haydock)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JOB:41:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>I.</i> Hebrew, "None is so fierce that dare stir it up." (Haydock) --- <i>Cruel,</i> or rash, like those to Tentyra, chap. iii. 8. (Calmet) --- This monster is terrible to those that flee, while it retires from the pursuer. --- But only these people dare to attack it. (Pliny, [Natural History?] viii. 25.) --- "I will not ask the crocodile to revenge me of my enemies," as some might do in a rage, through impotence. (Haydock) (Sanchez) (Menochius) --- <i>Countenance,</i> even though they might overcome the crocodile. God is here speaking. Septuagint, "Dost thou not fear, since it is ready for thee, (Grabe substitutes, "me,") for who will resist me?" or, "who shall stand against me, and live? All," &c., ver. 2. (Haydock) --- God ruleth not with cruelty, like a tyrant, but with justice, ease, and power. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - 'JOB:41:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Supplication.</i> This is explained by the Fathers as spoken of the devil. (Amama) --- But the Hebrew may signify, that God will reward each one according to his deserts, and that Job had consequently no reason to complain; or it means, that the strength and beauty of the crocodile should be made known. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion." Theo.[Theodotion?] in Septuagint, "I will not keep silence on his account, and the word of power shall take pity on his equal." (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - "JOB:41:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Garment,</i> or the skin. (Menochius) --- Who shall look steadfastly, or dare to take off its skin? --- <i>Mouth.</i> Protestants, \"Who can come to him with his double bridle?\" (Haydock) though it be of the greatest strength; or, who will enter its jaws, or put bits in them? It is reported that the Tentyrites jump on the crocodile's back, and having thrown a piece of wood into its open mouth, like bits, which they hold with both hands, they conduct it to the river side, and kill it. (Pliny viii. 25.) --- Septuagint, \"Who would enter the wrinkles of his breast, (Calmet) <i>or</i> the folds of its coat of arms?\" which may allude to the almost impenetrable scales of the leviathan. (Haydock) --- Symmachus, \"Who will enter the folds of its scales?\" The crocodile can open its mouth so wide as to swallow a heifer, or to let a man stand upright. (Calmet) --- Each jaw is furnished with thirty-six teeth. (Vansleb.)"
      v:006:
        - 'JOB:41:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Body.</i> Septuagint, "entrails are like brazen shields." Protestants, "<i>His</i> scales are <i>his</i> pride shut up together, as with a close seal." (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'JOB:41:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Sneezing.</i> When the whale breathes, it causes the water to foam. (Pineda) (Menochius) --- The eyes of the crocodile are also (Haydock) very bright, when out of the water. (Pliny viii. 25.) They appear first, and therefore were used as an hieroglyphic of Aurora, (Horus i. 65.) or of the <i>morning</i> star. (Haydock) --- Syriac, "His look is brilliant." Arabic, "The apples of his eyes are fiery, and his eyes are like the brightness of the morning." Septuagint, "like Aurora." (Calmet) --- Olaus (xxi. 5.) says, "that the eyes of the whale shine at night,...and at a distance, are taken by fishermen for great fires."'
      v:010:
        - 'JOB:41:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Fire,</i> when they spout water, (Menochius) or pursue their prey open mouthed. This description is extremely poetical, like that of anger, 2 Kings xxii. 9. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'JOB:41:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Smoke;</i> breath, or streams of water sent upwards.'
      v:012:
        - 'JOB:41:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Breath,</i> like bellows, ver. 10. (Menochius)'
      v:013:
        - 'JOB:41:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Neck.</i> Some deny that the crocodile has any, being formed like a lizard. But it is a dispute about words. The animal turns with difficulty, so that Thomas Gage assures us he escaped one by going in different directions. --- <i>Want.</i> It ravages a whole country. Hebrew, "fear." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "sorrow is turned into joy before him;" which seems strange. Septuagint, "destruction runs before him." (Haydock) --- The poets place fear, carnage, &c., in the train of Mars. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'JOB:41:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Place;</i> though people may shoot at him, they will make no impression, chap. xl. 20, 26. (Haydock) --- If God send his thunderbolts at him, the monster must however perish. (Calmet) --- Symmachus, "His flesh being cast for him, <i>as</i> in the foundry, (molten) is immoveable." (Haydock) --- Yet God destroyeth him whom man cannot overcome. (Worthington)'
      v:015:
        - "JOB:41:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Stone.</i> Pineda understands this of the whale's heart. Others suppose that it alludes to its cruel and fearless temper. (Menochius) --- The Arabs call a valiant man, \"heart of stone.\" (Calmet) --- <i>Smiths.</i> Protestants, \"as a piece of the nether <i>millstone,</i>\" (Haydock) which must be larger and more compact than that which is above. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"He hath stood immoveable as an anvil.\" (Haydock)"
      v:016:
        - "JOB:41:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Angels.</i> Elim. That is, the mighty, the most valiant, shall fear this monstrous fish, and in their fear shall seek to be purified, (Challoner) by contribution. (Sanchez) --- R. Levi has given a ridiculous exposition, which is adopted by Sa (Amama) and others, (Haydock; see Ezechiel ii. 7.; Aristotle iv. prob. 32.) as the natural consequences of fear. (Calmet) (Menochius) --- The Fathers refer this to the fall of Lucifer, when the other angels might tremble for their own safety. (Haydock) --- Angels with reverent fear honour God's power, and his most perfect servants are filled with apprehensions at his judgments; as the most valiant are terrified at the sight of this huge fish. (Worthington) --- Septuagint, \"If he turn, there is fear among the wild quadrupeds, jumping on the land.\" Hebrew, 'When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings, they purify themselves.\" (Protestants) or \"spoil themselves,\" (Calmet) expecting nothing but certain death. (Amama)"
      v:017:
        - 'JOB:41:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Plate.</i> Protestants, "habergeon." The precise nature of these arms is not known. (Calmet) --- Neither offensive or defensive weapons can avail. (Menochius) --- All agree that the crocodile can be pierced only under the belly. (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - 'JOB:41:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Are.</i> Literally, "are turned into stubble," as in Hebrew. (Haydock) --- They have no more effect. (Menochius)'
      v:020:
        - 'JOB:41:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Hammer.</i> Septuagint {GREEK:START sphura}σφυρα{GREEK:END}, means also, "the bottom of a rock." This would not overwhelm the whale; as some are represented like floating islands. Protestants, "darts." (Haydock) --- Chaldean, "axe." Others have, "the ballista;" an instrument to throw stones. (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - 'JOB:41:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Under him.</i> He shall not value the beams of the sun: and gold to him be like mire. (Challoner) (Menochius) --- Hebrew, "sharp stones (<i>or</i> potsherds) are under him; he spreadeth (or lieth upon) sharp-pointed things, <i>as</i> upon the mire." (Haydock) --- He is not afraid of being hurt.'
      v:022:
        - 'JOB:41:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>When.</i> Hebrew, "a pot of ointment." This boils out very much. (Calmet) --- The flesh of the crocodile has also the smell of musk; (Bochart) and Peter Martyr asserts, that Columbus found some in America, which plunged into the water, and left behind them the odour of musk or castor. When they are wounded, they give the same perfume to the sea, or rather to the waters, where they abide. The Hebrews style all deep rives and lakes, <i>seas.</i> (Calmet) --- Crocodiles were kept in the lake Mœris, being adored and honoured as gods. (Herodotus ii. 69.) --- Septuagint, "He deems the sea as a vase of ointment; (<b>23</b>) and the Tartarus of the abyss, like a prisoner." Theodotion adds, "He hath considered the abyss as a walk."'
      v:023:
        - 'JOB:41:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>The deep as growing old.</i> Growing hoary, as it were, with the froth which he leaves behind him. (Challoner) --- The Vulgate has well expressed the force of the original, and shews the rapidity with which the crocodile moves. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "one would think the deep to be hoary." The devil transforms himself into an angel (Haydock) of light. (Du Hamel)'
      v:024:
        - 'JOB:41:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Power.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "none like him on earth," for bulk. --- <i>One.</i> Septuagint, "made to be played with, <i>or</i> beaten, by my angels." (Haydock)'
      v:025:
        - 'JOB:41:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>He is king,</i> &c. He is superior in strength to all that are great and strong amongst living creatures: mystically it is understood of the devil, who is king over all the proud. (Challoner) (St. Gregory xxxiv. 4., and 17.) (Worthington) --- Hence Job perceived that God has also now permitted this cruel foe to exercise a dominion over him, and to pull him from his high station, though innocent. (Haydock) --- This would henceforward be more frequently the order of Providence, and therefore he expresses his entire resignation, chap. xlii. (Houbigant) --- <i>Pride:</i> the strongest and fiercest animals. (Haydock) --- The crocodile has been seen encountering even the elephant, and gaining the victory. He is king of all fishes. Septuagint, "of all in the waters." Chaldean, "of all the sons of the mountains:" or Theodotion, "of arrogance." This may particularly denote the Egyptians, as the crocodile was one of their gods; and people are often styled after them, Numbers xxi. 29., and Jeremias xlviii. 46. (Calmet) --- <i>Pharao</i> even means "a crocodile," in Arabic. (Bochart, Anim. p. ii. b. v. 16.) --- He is styled simply, <i>the proud,</i> Psalm lxxxviii. 11. (Calmet) --- The pride of the Egyptians was notorious, Ezechiel xxxii. 12. (Calmet)'

    commentary:
      v:002:
        - 'JOB:42:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>I know.</i> So the Keri orders us to translate, with all the ancient versions, as the Hebrew text has, "thou knowest;" which Prof. Chappelow and Schultens deem more "sublime," though one would think it was hardly "sense." (Kennicott) --- <i>Hid.</i> Hebrew, "of thine can be hindered." All thy orders must be obeyed. It is in vain to keep silence: (chap. xxxix. 34.) I will confess openly thy justice and power. (Haydock) -- He acknowledges his error, in not having before spoken enough of a just Providence. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - "JOB:42:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Who.</i> Hebrew, \"Who <i>is</i> he <i>that</i> hideth counsel without knowledge?\" (Protestants) This seems to allude to the words of God, chap. xxxviii. 2. Each of my friends has only rendered the ways of Providence more obscure, and I myself have not perfectly understood them. (Haydock) --- <i>Unwisely.</i> See chap. xxxix. 35. (Worthington) (Du Hamel) --- Hebrew, \"without knowledge, things wonderful to me, which I knew not.\" (Haydock) --- Now I comprehend that thou didst not afflict me, but hast given me into the hands of the enemy, as thou wilt hereafter do others of the greatest virtue, that their patience may shine the brighter, and be rewarded. I need inquire no farther, now <i>I see</i> thy design plainly, ver. 5. He does not accuse himself of any sin or false assertion, but acknowledges his infirmity in not having understood this before, ver. 6. (Houbigant) --- Septuagint, \"I have been told what I knew not, things great and wonderful, of which I was not apprized.\" (Haydock) --- Who can deny God's providence? (Du Hamel)"
      v:005:
        - 'JOB:42:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Seeth thee.</i> Some have thought that God now manifested himself from the cloud. (Eusebius, Dem. i. 4.; Titalman, &c.) But all now agree that he only enlightened his understanding, and made known his designs more clearly. (Calmet) --- Job now perceived that he had spoken too boldly, in saying, Hear, and I will speak, &c., ver. 4. The rest of this book is in prose. (Tirinus)'
      v:006:
        - "JOB:42:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Reprehend.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, \"vilify.\" (Haydock) --- I recall the obscure expression which has occasioned my friends to mistake. (Du Hamel) --- <i>Penance.</i> Hebrew, \"groan.\" Septuagint, \"pine away, I look upon myself as dust and ashes.\" Such are the sentiments which every one will entertain the nearer he approaches to the divine Majesty. (Haydock) --- I no longer assert my innocence, but wait patiently in my present forlorn condition, till thou shalt be pleased to dispose of me. How much would the reputation and authority of Job sink, if some of his assertions had been destitute of truth, particularly as the sacred author does not mention which they were! But God exculpates his servant, ver. 8. (Houbigant) --- Chaldean, \"I have despised my riches, and I am comforted with respect to my children, who are now reduced to dust and ashes.\" I find a consolation in submitting patiently to my sufferings, which I may have deserved on account of my unguarded speeches. (Calmet) --- Job waits not for God's answer, ver. 4. He at once feels an interior light, and is resigned. (Haydock) --- He had defended the truth against men: now, with more resignation, he is content to suffer, and does penance for himself and others. (Worthington)"
      v:007:
        - "JOB:42:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Two friends.</i> It is astonishing that Eliu is not also reprehended, as he was no better than the rest. Some answer, that God had passed sentence upon him first. Others maintain, that he spoke with greater dignity of God's judgments, and that his ignorance was blameless; while others remark, that he was connected with some of the three friends, or only came accidentally to enter into the debate. God gives sentence in favour of Job, though with some reproof for his manner of speaking. --- <i>As.</i> They had maintained false doctrines, and shewed a want of due respect and compassion for their friend; (Tirinus) whereas Job's assertions were true. (Calmet) --- How then can he be accused of denying the divine justice, or of speaking disrespectfully of Providence? God seemed to interrogate him on this account, though he approved of his sentiments, because some might draw such inferences from his words as all his friends did. But Job entertained no such ideas. He was not guilty of such <i>folly,</i> ver. 8. Septuagint, \"Thou hast sinned, and thy two friends, for you have spoken in my presence nothing true like my servant Job.\""

        - "JOB:42:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Offer.</i> Septuagint, \"Thou shalt make an oblation, {GREEK:START karpoma}καρπωα{GREEK:END}, for you.\" (Haydock) --- Yet holocausts seem to have been the only species of sacrifice before Moses. The number seven, has always been in a manner sacred; (Calmet) being doubled, it shews the greatness of the offence. (St. Gregory) (Worthington) --- Job was to present these victims to God, (Calmet) as the priest and mediator, (Du Hamel) of whom God approved. He officiated for his family, (Calmet) and was the most honourable person there. (Haydock) --- It seems Job was not present when God gave this injunction; perhaps some time after their debates. (Calmet) --- <i>Pray.</i> Behold the efficacy of the prayers of the saints, even while upon earth. How much greater will it be, when their charity is greater and unfailing! (Haydock) --- The many sacrifices would not have sufficed, if Job had not joined his prayer, as St. Chrysostom (or 5 con. Judœos) observes. His mediation did not derogate from God's mercy, under the law of nature; not does that of other men injure Christ's, under the law of grace, 2 Corinthians i. 11. We have here also a proof that both sacrifice and the devotion of the offerer, have their distinct effects; <i>opus operatum,</i> and <i>opus operantis,</i> as the schoolmen speak. Thus Job was honourably acquitted, while his friends were justly rebuked. Eliu needed no express condemnation; as what God says to one, must be applied to another in the same circumstances, chap. xxxiii. 14. Protestants are therefore inexcusable, who preach a doctrine not only condemned in their fellows, Luther, &c., but long before in ancient heretics: as the justification by faith alone was in the apostles' time, the rejection of ceremonies in baptism, of confirmation and penance, in the Novatians, &c. See St. Cyprian iv. ep. 2. (Worthington) --- <i>Face.</i> Septuagint, \"For I would not accept his face, and if it were not on his account, I had surely destroyed you. For you have not said to me any thing good (Roman Septuagint, <i>true,</i>) against (or concerning, {GREEK:START kata}κατα{GREEK:END},) my servant Job.\" They acted both against charity and truth. (Haydock) --- <i>Before.</i> Protestants, \"of me <i>the thing which is</i> right.\" The words underlined were not so in the earlier edition by Barker, printer to James I, (1613) where some of the margin translations are also omitted, ver. 14, &c. The matter is of no farther consequence, than to shew that alterations have taken place since the days of James I, whose Bible is supposed to be the standard of the English Church. The marginal version is also frequently neglected altogether, (the year of our Lord 1706) though the authors seem to have looked upon it as equally <i>probable</i> with that in the text. (Pref.) (Haydock)"
      v:010:
        - "JOB:42:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Penance.</i> Hebrew, \"return.\" He resolved to restore him to his former prosperous condition, while he prayed for those who had so cruelly exercised his patience. (Calmet) --- Protestants and Vatable, \"the Lord turned the captivity of Job:\" so any great distress may be styled, though Job was in a manner abandoned to the power and bondage of satan. Septuagint, \"But the Lord gave an increase to Job, and while he was praying for his friends, He forgave them their sin. And,\" &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Twice,</i> excepting children, who were living (Worthington) with God. (Rabbins) (St. Gregory, &c.) --- Some also include the years of Job's life, but that is not clear, (see Spanheim, c. 7.; Calmet) though not improbable; as he might very well live twice as long as he had done, if we suppose that he was about (Haydock) 50 when he was so much distressed (Petau); and thus arrived at the age of 140, ver. 16. (Haydock)"
      v:011:
        - 'JOB:42:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Brethren.</i> Who had before shamefully abandoned him, chap. vi. 13. (Calmet) --- <i>Bemoaned.</i> Literally, "shaked their heads at him," (Haydock) out of pity, (Menochius) or astonishment, (Tirinus; Calmet) at his fallen state, and at the present change for the better. They helped to restore him to affluence, in conformity with the will of God, who caused their presents of multiply. The kindred and friends of Job were undoubtedly numerous. (Haydock) --- <i>Ewe.</i> Kesita, "lamb," as most of the ancients agree, (Spanheim) or a piece of money, (Bochart) marked with the figure of a lamb. (Grotius) See Genesis xxxiii. 19. (Calmet) --- <i>Ear-ring.</i> Hebrew <i>Nezem,</i> an ornament (Haydock) "for the nose," still very common in the East. Symmachus adds, "it was unadorned," (Calmet) or plain. Septuagint, "a piece of gold worth four drachms, and not coined," {GREEK:START asemon}ασημον{GREEK:END}. (Haydock) --- Oleaster supposes that the nose was perforated, like the ear. But the ornament would thus be very inconvenient, and we may rather conclude that it hung down from the forehead upon the nose. (St. Jerome, in Ezechiel xvi.) (Pineda)'
      v:012:
        - 'JOB:42:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Asses.</i> Septuagint, "droves of," &c., which would greatly increase the number.'
      v:014:
        - "JOB:42:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Dies,</i> &c. \"Day....cassia....and horn of antimony.\" (Hebrew) --- <i>Yemima....Ketsiha....Keren hapuc.</i> This last may signify (Haydock) \"horn of change,\" (Pagnin) in allusion to Job's different states. (Menochius) (Du Hamel) --- Sometimes we find the Latin names retained, and at other times translated. It would perhaps be as well to give their force uniformly in English, or rather to insert the original terms, if they could be now properly expressed. But that is impossible. Protestants, <i>Jemima,</i> \"handsome as the day.\" <i>Kezia,</i> \"superficies, angle, or cassia.\" <i>Keren-happuch,</i> \"the horn or child of beauty.\" The marginal explanations are given at least in the edition Edinb. 1787. (Haydock) --- <i>Cassia,</i> an aromatic herb, which is perhaps not now to be found in Europe, Matthiol. in Dios. i. 12. --- The Arabs like to give such names to their children. (Spanheim, Hist. Job.) --- <i>Cornustibii,</i> (Hebrew <i>Puc</i>) means a sort of paint, used to blacken the eyelids, (4 Kings ix. 30.) or a precious stone, Isaias liv. 11. Chaldean, \"brilliant as an emerald.\" She was so styled, on account of her great beauty, (Calmet) in which she was not inferior to her two sisters. Septuagint, \"Horn of Amalthea,\" (Haydock) or of plenty, (Calmet) which is not an approbation of the fable, but to show the abundance which Job now enjoyed. (Nicetas.) --- Cassia might remind him of the bad smells to which he had been exposed. (Menochius) (Tirinus)"
      v:015:
        - 'JOB:42:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Daughters.</i> Alexandrian Septuagint adds, "and sons." --- <i>Brethren.</i> This was contrary to the custom of the Jews, (Numbers xxvii. 8.) but conformable to the Roman laws, and to the Koran. (Sur. 4.) (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - "JOB:42:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Years,</i> in all, as Judith is said to have dwelt in the house of <i>her husband</i> 105 <i>years;</i> though it is agreed that she only lived that space of time. (Haydock) --- Authors are much divided about the length of Job's life. Some suppose that he was afflicted with the leprosy at the age of 70, for several months, (Tirinus) or for a whole year, (Calmet) or for seven, (Salien) and that he lived twice as long after his re-establishment, in all 210. (Calmet) (Tirinus) Septuagint, \"Job lived after his chastisement 170,\" (Grabe substitutes 140 years. Then he marks with an obel as redundant) \"but all the years which he lived were 248;\" and adds from Theodition, \"And Job saw his sons and their children, <i>even</i> the fourth generation.\" (Haydock) --- The old Vulgate had also 248 years; while some Greek copies read 740. But Grotius thinks the life of Job was not extended beyond 200. Petau and Spanheim say 189, (Calmet) and Pindea 210, or rather 280, years. Yet the life of man, in the days of Moses, his contemporary, was not often longer than 120; so that if we allow Job 140, he would be an old man, and might see the fourth generation, ver. 10. (Haydock) --- The Greeks celebrate his festival on the 6th, the Latins on the 10th of May. (Pineda) --- <i>Days.</i> Here a long addition is found in the Greek, Arabic, and old Vulgate; and Theodotion has also inserted it in his version, as it seems to contain a true and ancient tradition, (see Eusebius, præp. ix. 25.) though the Fathers have properly distinguished it from the inspired text. It stands thus in the Alexandrian Septuagint with an obel prefixed: \"But it is written, that he shall be raised again, with those whom the Lord will restore <i>to life.</i>\" He, this man, as it is translated from the Syriac book, lived in the land of Ausites, (Hus.) on the borders of Idumea, and of Arabia, and was before called Jobab. But marrying an Arabian woman, he begot a son by name Ennon. But his father was Zareth, a descendant of the sons of Esau, and his mother was Bossora; (Arabic, a native of Bosra) so that he was the 5th (Arabic, the 6th) from Abraham. Now these were the kings who reigned in Edom; over which country he also ruled. First, Balac, <i>son</i> of Semphor; (others have <i>Beor</i>) and the name of his city was Dennaba. After Balak, Jobab, who is called Job. After him, Assom, a leader from the country of Theman. After this man, Adad, son of Barad, who slew Madian in the plain of Moab; and the name of his city was Gethaim. But the friends who came to him <i>were,</i> Eliphaz, <b>[</b>son of Sophan<b>]</b> of the sons of Esau, king of the Themanites; Baldad, <b>[</b>son of Amnon, of Chobar<b>]</b> of the Auchite tyrant; (Grabe substitutes the tyrant of the Saucheans, as they call our Suhites) Sophar, king of the Mineans.\" What is marked with crotchets, (Haydock) has been probably taken from Theodotion. See the Greek Catena. What follows occurs in the Alexandrian manuscript. (Calmet) --- \"<b>[</b>Theman, son of Eliphaz, he, as the Syriac book is rendered, lived in the land of Ausites, on the borders of the Euphrates. His former name was Jobab, but Zareth was his father, from the sun rising.\"<b>]</b> <i>or</i> eastern country. (Haydock) --- Job might very well be the 5th or 6th from Abraham, if he were a contemporary with Moses, as Levi and Amram would live at the same time with Rahuel and Zare; (See 1 Paralipomenon i. 35, 44.) so that this tradition agrees with history. But what is said of the Syriac version is not so certain. (Calmet) --- Some think the Syriac or Arabic was the original text, as the Greek seems to indicate, {GREEK:START outos ermeneuetai ek tes Suriakes Biblou, en men ge katoikon}ουτοσ ηρμηνηυηται ηκ τησ Συριακησ Βιβλου, ην μην γη κατοικον{GREEK:END}, &c. The passage at the end, where this is repeated, may be an interpolation, as the latter part seems rather to belong to Job. For how could Theman have both Eliphaz and Zareth for his <i>father?</i> Grabe therefore, marks it as such. It would be too long for us to transcribe (Haydock) the praises which the Fathers have given to Job, and the resemblance which they have discovered between him and Jesus Christ. See Hebrews iv. 15 and xiii. 12.; Tertullian, patient.; St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxiv. in Matt. St. Ambrose, in Psalm xxxvii. 21., observes, that his behaviour on the dunghill was the greatest condemnation of satan, who fell by pride, though so highly favoured. (Calmet) --- Besides the literal sense of this book, which displays the trials and victories of Job, we may consider him as a lively figure of Christ; who was perfectly innocent, and yet a man of sorrows: we may raise our minds to the contemplation of the greater glory which will attend the bodies of the just, after the resurrection; and, above all, we may discover lessons of morality, enforcing the observance of every virtue, and particularly of patience and resignation. (St. Gregory, &c.) (Worthington) --- The books of Machabees, which are the only remaining pieces of sacred history, might have been here inserted, as they are in Calmet's edition, that so all the historical part might come together. But it is more common to place those books after the prophets. They only relate a few of the transactions which took place during the 400 or 500 years preceding the Christian era. The rest must be borrowed from Josephus, or from profane authors. It would, however, be proper to read those books, and to have an idea of that period, before we attempt to explain the prophecies.

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - 'This Book takes its name from the holy man, of whom it treats; who, according to the more probable opinion, was of the race of Esau, and the same as Jobab, king of Edom, mentioned [in] Genesis xxxvi. 33. It is uncertain who was the writer of it. Some attribute it to Job himself; others to Moses, or some one of the prophets. In the Hebrew it is written in verse, from the beginning of the third chapter to the forty-second chapter. (Challoner) --- The beginning and conclusion are historical, and in prose. Some have divided this work into a kind of tragedy, the first act extending to chap. xv., the second to chap. xxii., the third to chap. xxxviii., where God appears, and the plot is unfolded. They suppose that the sentiments of the speakers are expressed, though not their very words. This may be very probable: but the opinion of those who look upon the work as a mere allegory, must be rejected with horror. The sacred writers speak of Job as of a personage who had really existed, (Calmet) and set the most noble pattern of virtue, and particularly of patience, Tobias ii. 12., Ezechiel xiv. 14., and James v. 11. Philo and Josephus pass over this history, as they do those of Tobias, Judith, &c. (Haydock) --- The time when Job lived is not clearly ascertained. Some have supposed (Calmet) that he was a contemporary with Esther; (Du Hamel; Thalmud) on which supposition, the work is here placed in its chronological order. But Job more probably lived during the period when the Hebrews groaned under the Egyptian bondage, (Haydock) or sojourned in the wilderness, Numbers xiv. 9. The Syrians place the book at the head of the Scriptures. (Calmet) --- Its situation has often varied, and is of no great importance. The subject which is here treated, is of far more; as it is intended to shew that the wicked sometimes prosper, while the good are afflicted. (Haydock) --- This had seldom been witnessed before the days of Abraham: but as God had now selected his family to be witnesses and guardians of religion, a new order of things was beginning to appear. This greatly perplexed Job himself; who, therefore, confesses that he had not sufficiently understood the ways of God, till he had deigned to explain them in the parable of the two great beasts, chap. xlii. 3. We cannot condemn the sentiments expressed by Job, since God has declared that they were <i>right,</i> chap. xlii. 8) and reprimands Elihu, (chap. xxxviii. 2.) and the other three friends of Job, for maintaining a false opinion, though, from the history of past times, they had judge it to be true. This remark may excupate them from the stain of wilful lying, and vain declamation. (Houbigant) --- However, as they asserted what was false, their words of themselves are of no authority; and they are even considered as the forerunners of heretics. (St. Gregory; St. Augustine, &c.) (Tirinus) --- Job refutes them by sound logic. (St. Jerome) --- We may discover in this book the sum of Christian morality, (Worthington) for which purpose it has been chiefly explained by St. Gregory. The style is very poetical, (Haydock) though at the same time simple, like that of Moses. (Du Hamel) --- It is interspersed with many Arabic and Chaldaic idioms; (St. Jerome) whence some have concluded, that it was written originally by Job and his friends (Haydock) in Arabic, and translated into Hebrew by Moses, for the consolation of his brethren. (Worthington) --- The Hebrew text is in many places incorrect; (Houbigant) and the Septuagint seem to have omitted several verses. (Origen) --- St. Jerome says almost eight hundred, (Calmet) each consisting of about six words. (Haydock) --- Shultens, in 1747, expressed his dissatisfaction with the labours of all preceding commentators. To explain this book may not therefore be an easy task: but we must be as short as possible. (Haydock) --- Those who desire farther information, may consult Pineda, (Worthington) whose voluminous work, in two folios, will nearly (Haydock) give all necessary information. (Calmet)'
