    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'MIC:1:1 | 1 | 1 | Morasthite, "of Maresa," (Chaldean; chap. i. 14.; Calmet) a village near Eleutheropolis. (St. Jerome) --- <i>Kings.</i> They reigned about sixty years. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'MIC:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Witness.</i> Deuteronomy xxxii., Isaias i., and vi.. The prophet discharges his duty, and will not be blameable, if people die in their sins, Jeremias iii. 18. (Worthington) --- This sublime address shews the importance of the subject, and how deep an impression the sins of Israel had made in his breast.'
      v:003:
        - 'MIC:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Earth,</i> to subdue the rebels, Amos iv. 13., and Habacuc iii. 3. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - 'MIC:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Melted.</i> Septuagint, "moved." (Haydock) --- <i>Cleft,</i> as it was to swallow up Core, (Numbers xvi. 31.) with the greatest ease.'
      v:005:
        - "MIC:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Jerusalem.</i> High places were left there under Joathan, 4 Kings xv. 35. Achab had introduced the worship of Baal into Samaria, and though the family of Jehu repressed this worship, it gained ground when Micheas appeared. (Calmet) --- This conduct excited God's indignation. (Haydock) --- He came to punish the most guilty. (Calmet)"
      v:006:
        - 'MIC:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Heap.</i> Septuagint, "hut to keep the fruit." Hebrew, "hillock of the field," (Haydock) to be cultivated. (Grotius) --- <i>Bare,</i> by Salmanasar, 4 Kings xvii. 6. It was afterwards rebuilt, (Calmet) but completely levelled by Hircan. (Josephus, Antiquities xiii. 18.)'
      v:007:
        - "MIC:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Her wages.</i> That is, her donaries or presents offered to her idols; or the hire of all her traffic and labour. (Challoner) --- Samaria had trafficked with infidels, and thus grew rich, but imitated their idolatry; (Worthington) and therefore was ruined, and her citizens and riches (Haydock) removed into Assyria. (Worthington) --- <i>Harlot.</i> They were gathered together by one idolatrous city, viz., Samaria: and they shall be carried away to another idolatrous city, viz., Ninive. (Challoner) --- The hire of prostitution was not to be received in God's temple, (Deuteronomy xxiii. 18.) which prohibition shews the antiquity of this abominable custom, Baruch vi. 9. (St. Augustine, City of God iv. 10.) (Calmet)"
      v:008:
        - 'MIC:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Naked.</i> Ill clothed, (Haydock) to shew the approaching calamity of the Israelites, Isaias xx. (Menochius) --- Septuagint and Chaldean explain all of the people, (Calmet) or of Samaria. "Therefore shall she lament and howl, go barefoot and naked, bewail like," &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Dragons,</i> when they are crushed by the elephant. (Solin xxxviii.) (Menochius) --- <i>Tannim</i> means also (Haydock) whales, &c., which make a horrible noise. --- <i>Ostriches,</i> or swans, Isaias xiii. 21. Both have a mournful note. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - 'MIC:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Gate.</i> That is, the destruction of Samaria shall be followed by the invasion of my people of Juda, and the Assyrian shall come and lay all waste even to the confines of Jerusalem. (Challoner) --- Juda received the worship of Baal from Israel. It shared in the punishment of that kingdom. The prophet alludes to the ravages of Sennacherib, ver 13. Yet Juda was much afflicted by Razin and Phacee, before that invasion: which caused Achaz to call in the aid of Theglathphalassar, 2 Paralipomenon xxviii., and 4 Kings xvi. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - 'MIC:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Geth.</i> Amongst the Philistines, lest they rejoice at your calamity. (Challoner) (2 Kings i. 20., and Amos iii. 9.) (Calmet) --- Tell not these calamities, which I foresee, among your enemies, lest they rejoice. But lament in your own houses, which shall be filled with dust. St. Jerome prays for the light of the Holy Ghost to understand this passage. (Worthington) --- <i>Weep ye not.</i> Keep in your tears, that you may not give your enemies an occasion of exulting over you: but in your own houses, or in your <i>house of dust,</i> your <i>earthly habitation, sprinkle yourselves with dust,</i> and put on the habit of penitents. Some take the house of <i>dust</i> (in Hebrew <i>Haphra</i>) to be the proper name of a city. (Challoner) --- <i>With tears.</i> Hebrew, "at all," (Protestants; Haydock) "in Acco," or Ptolemais, (Reland) or Bochim, (Haydock) a place near Jerusalem, Judges ii. 1. But no reference to this place, or to "the Enakim," (who appear in some copies of the Septuagint) seems to be made. --- <i>Of dust.</i> Samaria, ver. 6. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'MIC:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Place.</i> In Samaria. In the Hebrew, the <i>beautiful place</i> is expressed by the word <i>Shaphir,</i> which some take for the proper name of a city. (Challoner) --- It is thought that St. Jerome has given the sense of several proper names, (Calmet) or this has been done since in the Vulgate by some other. In the edition of his works, (A.D. 1533) we read, "The dwelling of Saphir passes from you: she hath not come out who inhabits Sennan. The house of Asel shall receive," &c. (Haydock) --- Saphir or Diocesarea was a strong place (Josephus, Jewish Wars ii. 37.) of Galilee, where Saanan was also situated, Judges iv. 11. Haetsel may denote "the vicinity." (Calmet) --- People shall not attempt to comfort their neighbours, being themselves under the greatest alarms. (Haydock) --- <i>Forth.</i> That is, they that dwelt in the confines came not forth, but kept themselves within, for fear. --- <i>Adjoining,</i> viz., Judea and Jerusalem, neighbours to Samaria, and partners in her sins, shall share also in her <i>mourning</i> and calamity: though they had pretended to <i>stand by themselves,</i> trusting in their strength. (Challoner) --- All the inhabitants shall be led into captivity naked. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - 'MIC:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Weak,</i> &c. Jerusalem is become weak unto any good; because she dwells in the bitterness of sin. (Challoner) --- Protestants, "the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good." (Haydock) --- We know not of any place called Maroth. Grotius would substitute Ramoth. (Calmet) --- <i>Bitterness.</i> St. Jerome, "Maroth." Symmachus, "provoking to bitterness." They are unable to defend their possessions. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - 'MIC:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Lachis,</i> when Sennacherib came to besiege it, 4 Kings xviii. 13. (Calmet) --- <i>Beginning.</i> That is, Lachis was the first city of Juda that learnt from Samaria the worship of idols, and communicated it to Jerusalem. (Challoner) --- This is not very probable. We may translate, "this is the source of sin," or of chastisement; or the imitation of Israel, is the chief of the crimes of Sion. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'MIC:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Send.</i> Lachis shall send to Geth for help; but in vain: for Geth, instead of helping, shall be found to be a <i>house of lying</i> and <i>deceit</i> to Israel. (Challoner) --- <i>Inheritance.</i> Some translate rather "Moreseth (or Morasthi) of Geth, the houses of Acsib," &c. Both these towns were near Geth, and perhaps at this time subject to it, 2 Paralipomenon xxviii. 18. Achaz sent to ask for aid against the king of Israel, ver. 9. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-Gath, the houses of Achzib <i>shall be</i> a lie to the," &c. (Haydock) --- There is an allusion between <i>Acsib</i> and a <i>lie,</i> as also between <i>Maresa</i> and an <i>heir,</i> (ver. 15.; Calmet) as the terms have those senses. (Haydock)'
      v:015:
        - 'MIC:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Heir.</i> <i>Maresa</i> (which was the name of a city of Juda) signifies <i>inheritance:</i> but here God by his prophet tells the Jews, that he will bring them <i>an heir</i> to take possession of their <i>inheritance:</i> and that <i>the glory of Israel</i> shall be obliged to give place, and to retire even to <i>Odollam,</i> a city in the extremity of their dominions. And therefore he exhorts them to penance in the following verse. (Challoner) --- Maresa shall fall a prey to the king of Assyria. Micheas was a native of this town, and he ironically addresses his countrymen. (Calmet) --- <i>Glory.</i> Thus he denotes "the misery" of Israel, which shall be extended to the last town in Juda. (Worthington) --- Hebrew means also "burden." Odolla was taken by Sennacherib, (Calmet) with the other towns around Jerusalem. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - 'MIC:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Eagle.</i> When it loses its feathers, it becomes languid. (Theodoret) --- This verse should be joined with the next chapter, which regards the kingdom of Israel. (Calmet)'

    verses:
      v:001: 'MIC:1:1 | 1 | 1 | The word {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}of the Lord that came to Micheas, the Morasthite, in the days of Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda: which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.'
      v:002: 'MIC:1:2 | 2 | 2 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Hear, all ye people: and let the earth give ear, and all that is therein: and let the Lord God be a witness to you, the Lord from his holy temple.'
      v:003: 'MIC:1:3 | 3 | 3 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}For behold the Lord will come forth out of his place: and he will come down, and will tread upon the high places of the earth.'
      v:004: 'MIC:1:4 | 4 | 4 | And the mountains shall be melted under him: and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as waters that run down a steep place.'
      v:005: 'MIC:1:5 | 5 | 5 | For the wickedness of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the wickedness of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Juda? are they not Jerusalem?'
      v:006: 'MIC:1:6 | 6 | 6 | And I will make Samaria as a heap of stones in the field when a vineyard is planted: and I will bring down the stones thereof into the valley, and will lay her foundations bare.'
      v:007: 'MIC:1:7 | 7 | 7 | And all her graven things shall be cut in pieces, and all her wages shall be burnt with fire, and I will bring to destruction all her idols: for they were gathered together of the hire of a harlot, and unto the hire of a harlot they shall return.'
      v:008: 'MIC:1:8 | 8 | 8 | Therefore will I lament, and howl: I will go stript and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and a mourning like the ostriches.'
      v:009: 'MIC:1:9 | 9 | 9 | Because her wound is desperate, because it is come even to Juda, it hath touched the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.'
      v:010: 'MIC:1:10 | 10 | 10 | Declare ye it not in Geth, weep ye not with tears: in the house of Dust sprinkle yourselves with dust.'
      v:011: 'MIC:1:11 | 11 | 11 | And pass away, O thou that dwellest in the Beautiful place, covered with thy shame: she went not forth that dwelleth in the confines: the House adjoining shall receive mourning from you, which stood by herself.'
      v:012: 'MIC:1:12 | 12 | 12 | For she is become weak unto good that dwelleth in bitterness: for evil is come down from the Lord into the gate of Jerusalem.'
      v:013: 'MIC:1:13 | 13 | 13 | A tumult of chariots hath astonished the inhabitants of Lachis: it is the beginning of sin to the daughter of Sion, for in thee were found the crimes of Israel.'
      v:014: 'MIC:1:14 | 14 | 14 | Therefore shall she send messengers to the inheritance of Geth: the houses of lying to deceive the kings of Israel.'
      v:015: 'MIC:1:15 | 15 | 15 | Yet will I bring an heir to thee that dwellest in Maresa: even to Odollam shall the glory of Israel come.'
      v:016: 'MIC:1:16 | 16 | 16 | Make thee bald, and be polled for thy delicate children: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle: for they are carried into captivity from thee.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'MIC:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Evil.</i> Septuagint, "labours." Hebrew, "vanity, <i>or</i> an idol." (Haydock) --- That is called unprofitable, which is very detrimental. (Worthington) --- <i>Morning,</i> suddenly and with zeal. (Calmet) --- <i>Is.</i> Hebrew, "has power," (Chaldean) "they have not raised their hands to God." (Septuagint; Arabic)'
      v:002:
        - 'MIC:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Oppressed.</i> Literally, "calumniated," (Haydock) as Jezabel did Naboth, 3 Kings xxi. 13.'
      v:003:
        - 'MIC:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Time.</i> It was very near. Micheas saw the ruin of Samaria, under Theglathphalassar and Salmanasar.'
      v:004:
        - 'MIC:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Say.</i> The Israelites sing this mournful canticle to ver. 7., which the prophet composes for them, to shew the certainty of the event. It is very difficult. (Calmet) --- The whole synagogue speaks. (Menochius) --- <i>Depart.</i> How do you pretend to say that the Assyrian is departing, when indeed he is coming to divide our lands amongst his subjects? (Challoner) --- The Cutheans were sent into the country, 4 Kings xvii. 24. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "and there was none to hinder him from returning, our lands were divided." (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - 'MIC:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>None.</i> Thou shalt have no longer any lot or inheritance in the land of the people of the Lord. (Challoner) --- Strangers had taken possession. (Calmet) --- Virgil has the like affecting thoughts. (Ec. i.) <i>Impius hæc tam culta novalia miles habebit?</i> (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - 'MIC:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Drop.</i> That is, the prophecy shall not come upon these. Such were the sentiments of the people that were unwilling to believe the threats of the prophets. (Challoner) --- The princes order the prophets not to inculcate so many miseries. (Worthington) --- Hebrew, "Make it not rain: they will make it rain: they will cause no rain like this: confusion shall not cease." The people beg that the prophets would not announce such judgments: but, (Calmet) correcting themselves, they bid them to say what they please, (Haydock) as nothing can befall them more terrible. Here the canticle ends. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "shed no tears, nor let them weep for these things, for she will not cast away reproaches, who says the house of Jacob has provoked the spirit," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - 'MIC:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Straitened.</i> Is he inclined to danger? The prophet replies, if God punishes, it is because the people will not repent. (Calmet) --- His mercy is extended to penitents, as well as to the just. (Worthington)'
      v:008:
        - 'MIC:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Away.</i> You have often stripped people of their necessary garments; and have treated such as were innocently passing on the way, as if they were at war with you. (Challoner) --- He alludes to Israel attacking Juda without cause, and killing 120,000 at once, while they took 200,000 women and children (ver. 9.) captives, whom Oded indeed persuaded them to release, 2 Paralipomenon xxviii. 6. Septuagint are very obscure in this chapter. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - "MIC:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Cast out,</i> &c. Either by depriving them of their houses; or, by your crimes, giving occasion to their being carried away captives, and their children, by that means, never learning to praise the Lord. (Challoner) --- The Jews accustomed them to sing God's praises early, while they were still innocent, Psalm viii. 2. Misery might cause them to complain of Providence. Perhaps the prophet alludes to the custom of divorces, Malachias ii. 15."
      v:010:
        - 'MIC:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Corruption.</i> Your sins will not permit you to remain any longer, and strangers shall defile this land. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - "MIC:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Would God,</i> &c. The prophet could have wished, out of his love to his people, that he might be deceived in denouncing to them these evils that were to fall upon them: but by conforming himself to the will of God, he declares to them that he is sent to prophesy, literally to <i>let drop</i> upon them, the wine of God's indignation, with which they should be made drunk; that is, stupified and cast down. (Challoner) --- Protestants, \"If a man, walking in the spirit of falsehood, do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and strong drink, he shall even be a prophet of this people.\" But I cannot thus deceive you. (Haydock)"
      v:012:
        - 'MIC:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Assemble.</i> God shews his mercy, in gathering his Church out of all nations. (Worthington) --- At least the Jews shall be converted, (Romans xi. 25.; St. Jerome; Eusebius, Dem. ii. 50.) or they shall be butchered by the Assyrians. (Sanct.) --- <i>Men.</i> The country was very populous when the Romans destroyed the Jews. They had returned by degrees. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - 'MIC:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Open.</i> Hebrew, "break down." (Haydock) --- <i>Divide.</i> Hebrew, "make a breach." They shall return boldly, and in triumph. (Calmet)'

        - 'MIC:4:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Last days.</i> This sometimes means after this, Isaias ix. 1. But here it denotes the time which shall elapse from Christ till the day of eternity. The Jews allow that this prediction regards the Messias, though they will not explain it of Jesus Christ. Their exceptions are well refuted by Ribera. (Worthington) --- It is plain that it can be verified nowhere else, but in the Church of Christ; though some expressions may, as usual, refer to the return of the captives. Isaias, (ii. 2.) &c., had already used the like terms under Ozias. Juda is here comforted, after its ruin had been denounced.'

The Church alone is stable, and built upon the rock.

      v:002:
        - "MIC:5:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Ephrata.</i> This was the ancient name (Haydock) of Bethlehem, (Genesis xxxv. 16.) though some think that it was so called after Caleb's wife, 1 Paralipomenon ii. 19. --- <i>Art,</i> or \"art thou?\" &c., which makes it agree with Matthew ii. 4. --- <i>Little.</i> Hebrew <i>tsahir,</i> (Haydock) is often rendered \"considerable.\" (Chaldean) --- <i>Thousands:</i> capital cities, Zacharias ix. 7. Bethlehem seemed too mean to send forth a ruler over the rest. The ancient Jews clearly understood this of the Messias. The moderns explain it of Zorobabel: but the expressions are too grand for him. (Calmet) --- St. Jerome accuses the Jews of having designedly omitted some cities, (Josue xv. 60.) because Bethlehem Ephrata is one. It is nowhere else thus described. (Kennicott) --- The priests substituted <i>land of Juda</i> instead of <i>Ephrata,</i> Matthew ii. (Haydock) --- The evangelist recites their words, to shew their negligence in quoting Scripture. \"Yet some assert, that in almost all quotations from the Old Testament the order or words are changed, and sometimes the sense,....as the apostles did not write out of a book, but trusted to memory, which is sometimes fallacious.\" (St. Jerome) --- This principle would he very dangerous, (Simon. Crit. i. 17.) and we should attribute the variation to other causes, as the sacred penman could not mistake. (Haydock) --- Bethlehem, though a little town, was rendered more illustrious than many others by the birth of Christ. (Worthington) --- <i>Forth.</i> That is, he who <i>as man</i> shall be born in thee, <i>as God</i> was born of his Father from all eternity. (Challoner) --- His coming was also long before announced. (Origen, contra Cels. i.) --- But the former sense is preferable. (Calmet) --- <i>Eternity</i>. These expressions singly imply a long time; (Exodus xxi. 6., and Psalm xxiii. 7.) but when doubled, <i>sæculum sæculi,</i> &c., they must be understood of an absolute eternity, which Christ enjoyed with the Father and the Holy Ghost; though, in his human nature, he was born in time.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'MIC:7:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Figs,</i> which are the worst. (St. Jerome; St. Ambrose in Luke vii. 3.) Yet they were eagerly sought after, before the other figs came to maturity. They had escaped the rigours of winter. Such Christ (Calmet) seemed to expect, Mark xi. 13.'
      v:002:
        - "MIC:7:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Holy man.</i> Hebrew <i>chasid,</i> (Haydock) \"the pious\" Assidean, 2 Machabees xiv. 6. The disorder of Israel was great, though some were religious. (Calmet) --- Such expressions only mean that few could be found, and that the far greatest number rejected the prophet's advice. (Worthington)"
      v:003:
        - 'MIC:7:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Giving.</i> Septuagint, "speaks words of peace." He flatters the prince, (Haydock) and dares not oppose the unjust. Syriac, "he says, bring presents." --- <i>Troubled it;</i> or, "have thy?" &c. Hebrew, "they confirm it."'
      v:004:
        - 'MIC:7:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Brier.</i> Hebrew <i>chedek,</i> or "thorn." Septuagint, "a consuming moth." --- <i>Inspection,</i> or of thy chiefs (Haydock) and prophets. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'MIC:7:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Bosom.</i> In times of general distress, even domestics are not trusted; because all are solicitous for themselves, even to the prejudice of others. (Worthington) --- Before the ruin of Israel civil wars raged, 4 Kings xv. Our Saviour alludes to this passage, Matthew x. 35., Luke xii. 52., and xxi. 16. People will rise up to oppress true believers; and these must abandon their nearest relations, when they prove an obstacle to salvation. Thus is the moral, and the other the literal sense. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - 'MIC:7:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>She;</i> Babylon, my enemy. (Challoner) --- It was taken by the Medes and Persians, who set the Jews at liberty, to the great mortification of their enemies.

It stood for some time afterwards. (Calmet)'

        - 'MIC:7:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Fortified.</i> Hebrew also, "Egypt, and from Egypt to the river Euphrates," &c. The Jews shall occupy their ancient limits, Amos viii. 12. (Calmet) --- The fenced <i>cities</i> may be Pelusium, Gaza, Tyre, &c. From all parts the captives shall return. (Haydock) --- They were very numerous under the Machabees, and in the time of Christ. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - 'MIC:7:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Land</i> of Babylon, (Challoner) or "the land of Judea (Haydock) has been," &c. It might also be again made desolate, because the captives built houses for themselves, and neglected the temple, Aggeus i. 10.'
      v:014:
        - 'MIC:7:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Alone:</i> destitute of all things, or in full security, Jeremias xv. 17., and Numbers xxiii. 9. God will feed his people (Calmet) in the most fertile places, designated by Carmel and Basan. (Haydock) --- A pastor must maintain sound doctrine and discipline. (Worthington)'
      v:015:
        - 'MIC:7:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Wonders.</i> The prophets speaking of the return, have Christ and his religion in view; so that they seem not to find terms sufficiently magnificent, Isaias ix. 15., and xliii. 16., and Zacharias x. 11. We know from Esdras that nothing so surprising attended the liberation of the people. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'MIC:7:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Strength,</i> because they cannot overcome the Hebrews or Christians. (Menochius) --- <i>Deaf,</i> being astonished, Job xxi. 5.'
      v:017:
        - 'MIC:7:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Serpents,</i> (Genesis iii. 14.) out of respect or rage. (Calmet) --- Converts shall humbly apply to the ministers of Christ to receive baptism and confirmation. (Theodoret; Sanct. lxvii.)'
      v:018:
        - 'MIC:7:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>No more,</i> for past offences. Yet, if they transgress again, they must not expect impunity. The Jews still bleed for the murder of the Messias. (Calmet)'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - '<strong>Micheas,</strong> of Morasti, a little town in the tribe of Juda, was cotemporary with the prophet Isaias, whom he resembles both in his spirit and his style. He is different from the prophet Micheas, mentioned in the Third Book of Kings, (chap. xxii.) for that Micheas lived in the days of king Achab, one hundred and fifty years before the time of Ezechias, under whom this Micheas prophesied, (Challoner) as he did in the two preceding reigns. (Haydock) --- He addresses both Israel and Juda, and predicts the happiness of the Jews after the captivity, as a figure of what the church should enjoy. (Calmet) --- The Jews shall embrace the faith at last, after the Gentiles. (Worthington) --- We have only a small part of the predictions of Micheas, though he may have written no more. His style is obscure, like that of Osee. (Calmet) --- His name signifies "humility," or "who <i>is</i> like." (St. Jerome)'
