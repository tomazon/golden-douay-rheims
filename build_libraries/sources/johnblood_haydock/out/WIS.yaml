    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'WIS:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Goodness.</i> Entertain just sentiments of the Deity, and avoid all duplicity. This truth is placed in the strongest light in the five first chapters, or preface.'
      v:003:
        - 'WIS:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Unwise.</i> He shews that their wisdom is all folly, and that they cannot withstand his power. (Calmet) --- There are mortal sins of <i>thought.</i> (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - 'WIS:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Subject.</i> Or "enslaved to sin." (Haydock) --- Soul and body are intimately connected, so that the actions of one defile the other, and banish wisdom.'
      v:005:
        - 'WIS:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Discipline.</i> The instructive light of the Holy Ghost. --- <i>Understanding.</i> Those who deny God or Providence, (Calmet) and lead a wicked life, are abandoned. (Haydock) --- <i>Not abide. <u>Elegchthesetai</u>:</i> "He shall be connected <i>or</i> manifested," shewing that he will not <i>acquit</i> the guilty, ver. 6. (Menochius) --- When Solomon fell, his wisdom ceased. Iniquity soon betrays itself. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'WIS:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>That.</i> St. Augustine reads <i>hic,</i> "this who," more correctly than <i>hoc,</i> as it refers to the spirit, (Calmet) which having made and filled all things, must be perfectly acquainted with every transaction. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - 'WIS:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Jealousy.</i> God is <i>strong and jealous,</i> Exodus xx. (Calmet) --- He examines the smallest deviation from the paths of rectitude. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - 'WIS:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Seek not</i> with such eagerness (<i>zelare</i>) your own ruin, (Calmet) by an evil life, (Worthington) or rather throw not the blame on death, as if you were necessitated to sin. God created man to be immortal.'
      v:014:
        - 'WIS:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Health.</i> Good, Genesis i. 31. (Calmet) --- <i>Poison,</i> or medicine, (Worthington) <i>medicamentum.</i> (Worthington) --- Poison and wild beasts become noxious to man only after sin. It is this which infects the veins. All may derive an antidote from Jesus Christ.'
      v:016:
        - 'WIS:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>It.</i> Septuagint, {GREEK:START auton}αυτον{GREEK:END}. --- <i>Death.</i> The wicked strive (Menochius) to draw upon themselves the second death (Calmet) as they will not repent. (Worthington) (Isaias xxviii. 15.) (Haydock)'

      v:001: 'WIS:1:1 | 1 | 1 | Love justice, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}you that are the judges of the earth. Think of the Lord in goodness, and seek him in simplicity of heart:'
      v:002: 'WIS:1:2 | 2 | 2 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}For he is found by them that tempt him not: and he sheweth himself to them that have faith in him.'
      v:003: 'WIS:1:3 | 3 | 3 | For perverse thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise:'
      v:004: 'WIS:1:4 | 4 | 4 | For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.'
      v:005: 'WIS:1:5 | 5 | 5 | For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding, and he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in.'
      v:006: 'WIS:1:6 | 6 | 6 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent, and will not acquit the evil speaker from his lips: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 1}for God is witness of his reins, and he is a true searcher of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.'
      v:007: 'WIS:1:7 | 7 | 7 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world: and that which containeth all things, hath knowledge of the voice.'
      v:008: 'WIS:1:8 | 8 | 8 | Therefore he that speaketh unjust things, cannot be hid, neither shall the chastising judgment pass him by.'
      v:009: 'WIS:1:9 | 9 | 9 | For inquisition shall be made into the thoughts of the ungodly, and the hearing of his words shall come to God, to the chastising of his iniquities.'
      v:010: 'WIS:1:10 | 10 | 10 | For the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the tumult of murmuring shall not be hid.'
      v:011: 'WIS:1:11 | 11 | 11 | Keep yourselves, therefore, from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and refrain your tongue from detraction, for an obscure speech shall not go for nought: and the mouth that belieth, killeth the soul.'
      v:012: 'WIS:1:12 | 12 | 12 | Seek not death in the error of your life, neither procure ye destruction by the works of your hands.'
      v:013: 'WIS:1:13 | 13 | 13 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}For God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.'
      v:014: 'WIS:1:14 | 14 | 14 | For he created all things, that they might be: and he made the nations of the earth for health: and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor kingdom of hell upon the earth.'
      v:015: WIS:1:15 | 15 | 15 | For justice is perpetual and immortal.
      v:016: 'WIS:1:16 | 16 | 16 | But the wicked, with works and words have called it{VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0} to them: and esteeming it a friend, have fallen away, and have made a covenant with it: because they are worthy to be of the part thereof.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'WIS:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Right.</i> He shews how the wicked brought death into the world, and expresses the sentiments of the epicureans, as in Ecclesiastes. The six first chapters are a sort of paraphrase of the nine first of Proverbs, in which the attractions of virtue and of pleasure are contrasted, &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Remedy.</i> Literally, "refreshment." Septuagint, "healing." --- <i>Hell,</i> or the grave. (Haydock) --- They reject as fabulous, the accounts of people being raised to life by miracle. (Calmet) --- They suppose that the soul is mortal, and that there is neither reward nor punishment after death. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - 'WIS:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Nothing.</i> Septuagint, "by chance." The epicureans imagined that the first man was produced by the conflux of atoms. (Lucret. i. 5.) (Calmet) --- <i>Smoke,</i> or vanishes like it. --- <i>And speech.</i> Budæus would substitute "a little spark." --- <i>Speech</i> may be used for "thing." Our life is something like a spark. (Menochius) --- Speech is an effect of the rational soul, as a spark comes from fire. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'WIS:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Sealed,</i> like one in the tomb, Matthew xxvii. 66. The epicureans were well convinced of the fragility of our nature: but they drew false inferences from it, pretending that we should enjoy ourselves now, as there will be no future life. This they ought to have proved. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - WIS:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Come.</i> From the disbelief of future rewards and punishments proceeds the epicure's life. (Worthington)
      v:007:
        - 'WIS:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Time.</i> Alexandrian Septuagint, "of spring." (Haydock) --- Youth is the spring of life. The voluptuous conclude, from the transitory nature of things, that we should make use of them. Would it not be more rational to despise them? (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'WIS:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Worth.</i> Strange maxims! which few will dare to proclaim, though they act according to them. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'WIS:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Just.</i> Infidels are not content to live in riot: they also persecute the just. (Worthington) --- This passage points out the conduct of the Jews towards our Saviour, in so striking a manner, that Grotius would assert it has been altered by some Christian. But the Fathers adduce it as a clear prediction (Calmet) of the Jewish malice, Matthew xxvii. 41., and Mark xiv. 53. (Worthington)'
      v:013:
        - 'WIS:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Knowledge.</i> The prophets spoke to sinners in the name of God, and many of them lost their lives in the cause. Christ appeared as a new star, to promote their welfare; yet this only serves to irritate them. (Calmet) (John viii. 16.)'
      v:020:
        - 'WIS:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Words.</i> Or he shall be punished for what he has said. (Syriac, Vat.[Vatable?], &c.) (Matthew xxvi. 61.) (Calmet) --- We shall hence form a judgment of his real merits, (Menochius) unless this be spoken ironically; as if the just had foolishly flattered himself with the divine protection, Matthew xxvii. 43. (Haydock)'
      v:022:
        - 'WIS:2:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Secrets.</i> The disbelief of mysteries leads to a dissolute life, and to the persecution of the just. (Worthington) --- The pagans knew not the advantages of suffering, and even the apostles were ignorant of the mystery of the cross, till after the resurrection. (Calmet)'
      v:024:
        - 'WIS:2:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Envy.</i> Lucifer thought that the honour of the hypostatic union (Calmet) belonged to the angelical, rather than to the human nature; and this he was guilty of envy, (Haydock) and strove to become <i>like the most High,</i> Isaias xiv. 14. (St. Bernard, ser. xvii. in Canticle of Canticles) (Cornelius a Lapide, &c.)'

    verses:
      v:001: 'WIS:2:1 | 1 | 1 | For they have said, reasoning with themselves, <i>but</i> not right: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}The time of our life is short and tedious, and in the end of a man there is no remedy, and no man hath been known to have returned from hell:'
      v:002: 'WIS:2:2 | 2 | 2 | For we are born of nothing, and after this we shall be as if we had not been: for the breath in our nostrils is smoke: and speech a spark to move our heart,'
      v:003: 'WIS:2:3 | 3 | 3 | Which being put out, our body shall be ashes, and our spirit shall be poured abroad as soft air, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, which is driven away by the beams of the sun, and overpowered with the heat thereof:'
      v:004: 'WIS:2:4 | 4 | 4 | And our name in time shall be forgotten, and no man shall have any remembrance of our works.'
      v:005: 'WIS:2:5 | 5 | 5 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}For our time is <i>as</i> the passing of a shadow, and there is no going back of our end: for it is fast sealed, and no man returneth:'
      v:006: 'WIS:2:6 | 6 | 6 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Come, therefore, and let us enjoy the good things that are present, and let us speedily use the creatures as in youth.'
      v:007: 'WIS:2:7 | 7 | 7 | Let us fill ourselves with costly wine, and ointments: and let not the flower of the time pass by us.'
      v:008: 'WIS:2:8 | 8 | 8 | Let us crown ourselves with roses, before they be withered: let no meadow escape our riot.'
      v:009: 'WIS:2:9 | 9 | 9 | Let none of us go without his part in luxury: let us every where leave tokens of joy: for this is our portion, and this <i>our</i> lot.'
      v:010: 'WIS:2:10 | 10 | 10 | Let us oppress the poor just man, and not spare the widow, nor honour the ancient grey hairs of the aged.'
      v:011: 'WIS:2:11 | 11 | 11 | But let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.'
      v:012: 'WIS:2:12 | 12 | 12 | Let us, therefore, lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn, and he is contrary to our doings, and upbraideth us with transgressions of the law, and divulgeth against us the sins of our way of life.'
      v:013: 'WIS:2:13 | 13 | 13 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God.'
      v:014: 'WIS:2:14 | 14 | 14 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}He is become a censurer of our thoughts.'
      v:015: "WIS:2:15 | 15 | 15 | He is grievous unto us, even to behold: for his life is not like other men's, and his ways are very different."
      v:016: 'WIS:2:16 | 16 | 16 | We are esteemed by him as triflers, and he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness, and he preferreth the latter end of the just, and glorieth that he hath God for his father.'

      v:018: 'WIS:2:18 | 18 | 18 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies.'

  c:003:
    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'WIS:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Of death,</i> is not in Septuagint. During life the just are protected by God, (Luke xii. 7.) and still more in death. This passage is very applicable to martyrs. (Calmet) --- Temporal death is to the just the road to happiness, where they shall not incur damnation, or <i>the torment of death.</i> Though the martyrs seem to be utterly destroyed, they pass to joys eternal and unspeakable. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - 'WIS:3:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Die.</i> In this the wicked are not under a mistake; but they err when they suppose that the just shall be no more. If the hopes of the pious were confined to this world, they would be the most miserable of all, 1 Corinthians xv. 19. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'WIS:3:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Holocaust.</i> The sufferings (Menochius) which they have voluntarily endured, cause them to be pleasing to God. (Haydock) (Zacharias xiii. 9.) --- <i>Time</i> of judgment, or of death. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "at the time of their visitation, they shall shine, and," &c., ver. 7., and Matthew xiii. 43. (Haydock) (Zacharias xii. 6.)'
      v:008:
        - "WIS:3:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Judge.</i> All the just shall approve of God's condemning the wicked. (Worthington) --- They shall be invested with power, (Apocalypse ii. 26., and Matthew xix. 28.) which, like that of Christ, will be of a spiritual nature, (Haydock) and will appear most terrible at the last day, Matthew xxviii. 18., and Apocalypse xix. 6. (Calmet)"
      v:009:
        - "WIS:3:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Elect.</i> Septuagint add, \"and a visitation for his saints.\" Charity secures both faith and hope; which, without it, are unavailing to happiness. (Haydock) --- Those who have the virtue of hope, will await the completion of God's promises."
      v:012:
        - 'WIS:3:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Foolish.</i> Dissolute, as the sequel shews, Proverbs ix. 13., and Romans i. 26. The family of the wicked imitate his conduct, and become his torment. (Calmet) --- This is often the case. In the moral sense, the sensuality and works of the impious are corrupt. (Worthington)'
      v:013:
        - 'WIS:3:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Barren.</i> The Jews deemed this a reproach. But it is better than to have children by a crime. (Menochius) --- <i>Fruit.</i> Her good works shall serve instead of children for her glory, at the hour of death.'
      v:016:
        - 'WIS:3:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Perfection.</i> Literally, "shall be in consummation," or wholly destroyed. (Haydock) --- They shall not come to age, or Septuagint, "initiated." The pagans excluded the base-born from their mysteries, as the Church does from holy orders; and experience shews, that the fruits of adultery are often miserable, (Calmet) and while they imitate their parents, they can have no hope, ver. 18.'
      v:018:
        - 'WIS:3:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Trial.</i> Literally, "of knowing" (Haydock) the works of all. The crime of adulterers is not imputed to their offspring; and it sometimes happens, that the children of saints are cast away.'

        - 'WIS:4:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Glory.</i> The offspring of the chaste is happy, (Calmet) and honourable: (Haydock) very different from that of adulterers. (Calmet) --- Bodily chastity is a great virtue; but purity of faith is more requisite to please God, being the foundation of all virtues. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - 'WIS:4:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Itself.</i> Virtue extorts the esteem even of worldlings. Antiochus wept for Onias, 2 Machabees iv. 37. (Calmet) --- <i>Sublatum ex oculis quærimus invidi.</i> (Horace, iii. od. 24.) --- <i>Conflicts.</i> In the cause of continence. (Calmet)'

        - 'WIS:4:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Death.</i> He is always ready; but dies in his youth. (Calmet) --- Whenever death comes, it is for his advantage, and if he depart in his youth, his immaculate life is to be preferred before the old age of the wicked, ver. 16. (Worthington)'
      v:011:
        - "WIS:4:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Away.</i> Like Henoch, Genesis v. 24., and Hebrews xi. 5. (Calmet) --- \"Bad conversations corrupt the best manners,\" 1 Corinthians xv. 33., and Isaias lvii. 1. But could not God have supported the just under temptation? Undoubtedly. His judgments are unsearchable. (St. Augustine, de Præd. xiv.) (Calmet) --- The holy doctor thence proves, that those who die in a just state, might have forfeited it, if they had lived longer. God knew this possibility, and that it would not take place, and his foreknowledge agrees with man's free-will, which some, inclining to Pelagianism, would controvert. They objected to this authority: and he was therefore obliged to prove that the book of Wisdom is canonical. (Ibid.[St. Augustine, de Præd. xiv.?]) (Worthington)"
      v:012:
        - 'WIS:4:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Bewitching.</i> Thus the pleasures and goods of the world are well described. For as <i>fascination</i> consists in a delusion of the people, who suppose that their senses are deceived by vain appearances; so it is the mistake of worldlings to believe that the objects of their desires are real goods, and contain no danger.'
      v:019:
        - 'WIS:4:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Speechless.</i> The damned shall have no excuse, being condemned by their own conscience, (Worthington) which shall be instead of a thousand witnesses. (Menochius) --- In three words, three different punishments are specified.'

      v:026:
        - 'WIS:7:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Goodness.</i> This is particularly noticed, as he speaks of the favours received. It was also an effect of infinite goodness, that the Deity should communicate itself substantially, in the generation of the Son, and the procession of the Holy Ghost. (Menochius)'
      v:027:
        - 'WIS:7:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Prophets.</i> No age or nation has been left destitute by God. Among the Gentiles, Job was a saint. (Haydock) --- The philosophers also knew God, (Romans i. 21.) and taught many important truths, (Calmet) though they erred in other respects, and dishonoured their profession.

(Menochius) --- When Anaxagoras discovered the latter, he durst not write, but only instructed his disciples in secret, for fear of being taken for an atheist, or magician. (Plut.[Plutarch?] in Nicias.) --- The sciences, which are now common, were formerly confined to few; and the people looked upon eclipses as so many prodigies.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'WIS:13:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Vain.</i> Septuagint, "foolish by nature, who are ignorant of God." (Haydock) --- In this and the three following chapters, the miseries of idolatry are described, to shew the value of wisdom and piety. (Calmet) --- Without the knowledge of God, all is darkness, 1 Corinthians ii. 2. (St. Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho) --- <i>Is. He who is,</i> must be the most proper name of God, Exodus iii. 14. Philosophers could perceive that all creatures had a beginning, and that there must be some first cause or God, whom some confessed, but did not honour as they ought, Romans i. (Worthington) --- <i>Could not.</i> Inasmuch as they were vain. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - 'WIS:13:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Fire.</i> The chief god of the Persians. --- <i>Wind.</i> Zephyrus, &c. --- <i>Air.</i> Which is perhaps the wind. Socrates was accused of adoring nothing, but heaven and the clouds, (Aristot.[Aristotle?] nub.) as the Jews were. <i>Nil præter nubes et Cœli numen adorant.</i> (Juvenal xiv. 97.) --- <i>Stars.</i> The zodiac, or pleiads. This species of idolatry was most ancient and general. --- <i>Water.</i> The ocean, Neptune, &c. The Egyptians adored water above all, as the origin of other things. Hence they were punished first by it. (Philo, vit. Mor. 1.) --- <i>Moon.</i> These were mostly the objects of worship, under the names of Baal, Astarte, (Calmet) the Phœbus, or Dianæ of the Romans. (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - 'WIS:13:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Thereby.</i> God is announced by the heavens, and by all creatures, Psalm xviii. 1., and Romans i. 20. "Who can look up to heaven, and be so foolish as not to allow that there is a God?" (Cicero, Harusp.)'
      v:010:
        - "WIS:13:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Of men.</i> The pagans in general took the material statue to be the residence of a god. (St. Augustine, City of God chap. vii. 6., and viii. 13.) --- The more learned regarded the figures of the sun, &c., as his representations, while others supposed that Jupiter meant the heavens, Juno the air, Vulcan, fire, &c. --- <i>Hand.</i> This is to abuse antiquity. The idol of the Arabs was a rough stone. In more polished nations, the workmanship of Praxiteles, Phidias, &c., was more regarded. (Calmet) --- As no creature deserves to be esteemed a god, much less do the works of men's hands. (Worthington)"
      v:014:
        - 'WIS:13:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Vermilion.</i> The ancients greatly esteemed this colour, (Calmet) and painted with it the statues of their gods on festival days, and the bodies of those who had the honour of a triumph. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxiii. 6.)'
      v:015:
        - 'WIS:13:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Iron.</i> Baruch (vi. 26.) ridicules the same custom, and the other prophets intimate that the pagans took these statues to be really gods, otherwise their practice was no more blameable than that of the Jews, who fastened the cherubim to the ark with gold, and carried them. But the latter did not believe that the Deity resided personally in those images; no more than we do, that Christ is attached to his image on the cross. This distinguishes the behaviour of the faithful from that of pagans. (Calmet)'

Heb.) --- The corruption of morals was the natural consequence, ver. 12. --- <i>Ever.</i> Christ shall destroy them. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - "WIS:14:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Servants.</i> This was at first done privately, and made the way for public idolatry. Calvin attempts to refute this assertion, maintaining that Laban's idols were more ancient, and not images. But this argument is nugatory, as <i>theraphim</i> may be rendered either <i>images,</i> (Protestants, 1552.) or <i>idols.</i> (Protestants, 1603.) The latter version is preferable, as Laban called them his gods, and the Greek and Latin have idols. It is also certain, that Ninus set up the image of his father, Jupiter Belus, to be honoured by the people, before Abraham's time; and the fathers agree, that the making of images in memory of the dead, was the first occasion of idolatry. (St. Chrysostom, hom. 87. in Matthew; St. Jerome in Osee ii., &c.) (Worthington) --- Nimrod ordered divine honours to be paid to his deceased son. (Gul. Paris. Leg.) --- Yet this fact is not certain. Diophante, the Lacedemonian, assigns the same origin to idolatry as is here given. (Grotius)"

They fear no harm, ver. 29. Yet they are perjured if they believe Jupiter, for example, to be a god, (St. Augustine, ep. 54. ad Pub.) and if they do not, they are impious; abusing an oath, which is in itself sacred. (Calmet)'

      v:009: 'WIS:17:9 | 9 | 9 | For though no terrible thing disturbed them: yet being scared with the passing by of beasts, and hissing of serpents, they died for fear: and denying that they saw the air, which could by no means be avoided.'

      v:016: 'WIS:17:16 | 16 | 16 | For if any one were a husbandman, or a shepherd, or a labourer in the field, and was suddenly overtaken, he endured a necessity from which he could not fly.'
      v:017: 'WIS:17:17 | 17 | 17 | For they were all bound together with one chain of darkness. Whether it were a whistling wind, or the melodious voice of birds, among the spreading branches of trees, or a fall of water running down with violence,'
      v:018: 'WIS:17:18 | 18 | 18 | Or the mighty noise of stones tumbling down, or the running that could not be seen of beasts playing together, or the roaring voice of wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the highest mountains: these things made them to swoon for fear.'

But they induce no more confusion than the various strings of a harp, when they are touched with skill, though they have each their respective name and sound. The ancients frequently compared the harmony of the universe to a musical instrument.

But it seems some thing should be said respecting the original petition for wisdom; whence we conclude, with Grotius, that the work is imperfect: (Calmet) though this is by no means clear, as the prayer is sufficiently expressed in the nine first chapters, if not in the whole book, and God answers it, 3 Kings ix.

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "This book is so called, because it treats of the excellence of <b>Wisdom,</b> the means to obtain it, and the happy fruits it produces. It is written in the person of Solomon, and contains his sentiments. But it is uncertain who was the writer. It abounds with instructions and exhortations to kings and magistrates to administer justice in the commonwealth, teaching all kinds of virtues under the general names of justice and wisdom. It contains also many prophecies of Christ's coming, passion, resurrection, and other Christian mysteries. The whole may be divided into three parts: [<b>1.</b>] In the six first chapters, the author admonishes all superiors to love and exercise justice and wisdom. [<b>2.</b>] In the next three, he teacheth that wisdom proceedeth only from God, and is procured by prayer, and a good life. [<b>3.</b>] In the other ten chapters, he sheweth the excellent effects, and utility of wisdom and justice. (Challoner) --- Their authority is surely greater than that of the Jews, (Calmet) whom Protestants choose to follow. (Haydock) --- Before they attack us, they must, however, answer this prescription. (Calmet) --- St. Irenæus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, St. Athanasius, &c., attribute this book to Solomon; and, though St. Jerome and St. Augustine call this in question, they maintain its divine authority. Sometimes the Fathers abstain from urging it against the Jews, because they[the Jews] reject it, for the same reason as our Saviour proved the immortality of the soul, against the Sadducees, from the books of Moses alone, though other texts might have been adduced. The Councils of Carthage, 419, Florence, Trent, &c., declare this book canonical, (Worthington) agreeably to the ancient Fathers. (St. Augustine, Præd. xiv., and City of God xvii. 20., &c.) --- Philo (St. Jerome) the elder, (Worthington; Menochius) one of the Septuagint (Genebrard) might compile this work from the sentences of Solomon, preserved by tradition, as Sirach's son did that of Ecclesiasticus; (Worthington) or it is styled \"Solomon's Wisdom,\" (Septuagint; Haydock) on account of its resembling his works, in like manner as the Second of Kings is called <i>Samuel's,</i> though he wrote none of that book. (Worthington) --- Sixtus (Bib. viii. hær. ix.) and others, maintain, that this was written originally in Hebrew, and some think by Solomon; being translated by the Septuagint. But these go too far. (Calmet) --- The nine first chapters seem, however, to be the production of Solomon, though the latter may have been added by the Greek translator, (Houbigant) who must, therefore, have been divinely inspired. (Haydock) --- The sentiments are very grand, (Calmet) and contain a prediction of the sufferings of the <i>just</i> one, whence we may infer, that the name of the author was originally in the title, like that of all other prophets. The arguments which Calmet adduces, to prove that Solomon was not the author of the first part of this work, may easily be refuted. In the New Testament, that part is frequently quoted, whence we may gather, that it was allowed to be the work of Solomon. (Houbigant, præf. p. 176.) --- Some style this work <i>Panaretos,</i> as being an exhortation to all virtues. (Calmet) --- All the five sapiential books (Proverbs, &c.) are cited under the title of Wisdom in the mass-book. Superiors are here admonished to act with justice, and taught that wisdom is to be obtained by prayer, and by a good life, chap. ix. Its effect and utility (Worthington) form the subject of the latter part. See Apocrypha, vol. i. p. 597. (Haydock)"
