    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1MA:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Now.</i> Literally, "And." (Haydock) --- Thus many Hebrew books commence, as Exodus, Josue, Baruch, &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Greece,</i> over the whole. He was chosen generalissimo. (Haydock) --- He conquered many of the Greeks, and overthrew Darius Condomanus, the year of the world 3674. (Calmet) --- His dominion in Syria may be meant. (Grotius) --- Alexander [the Great] was the first who reigned in that great monarchy, which he founded. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - 1MA:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Holds.</i> He was never defeated. (Just. xii.)
      v:003:
        - '1MA:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Earth,</i> even to India, beyond which the ancients knew of nothing. --- <i>Quiet,</i> or silent; depopulated, (Isaias xiv. 7.) and obedient, Habacuc ii. 20.'
      v:004:
        - '1MA:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Up.</i> He was spoiled by prosperity, (Calmet) and would pass for a god, and be styled "king of the world." (Just. xii.)'
      v:006:
        - '1MA:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Bed.</i> Some suppose through poison, (Diodorus xvii.; St. Jerome, ad Lætam.) or excess of wine. (Atheneus x. 11.) --- This was enough. (Haydock) --- So perished the man who would claim divine honours! (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - '1MA:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Servants.</i> On the ninth day of sickness which preceded his death, he admitted all his soldiers to kiss his hand. Then he asked his friends, if they thought they should find such another king? As they were silent, he predicted what bloodshed would ensue, and told them to bury him in the temple of Ammon. When they asked to whom he left the throne, he said, "to the most worthy." He gave his ring to Perdiccas; whence all inferred, that he should be regent till the proper heirs came of age. Perdiccas desired to know when he would have divine honours: to which Alexander [the Great] replied with these his last words, "when you are happy:" (Just. xii.; Diodorus xvii.) as much as to say, never. (Haydock) --- This seems contrary to the sacred historian. But his authority is far superior. (Calmet) --- <i>Kingdom.</i> This is otherwise by Q. Curtius; though he acknowledges that divers were of that opinion, and that it had been delivered by some authors. (liber[book] x.) But here we find from the sacred text that he was in error. (Challoner) --- By delivering his ring to Perdiccas, Alexander gave him authority to make this division. (Worthington) --- Many assert, that he gave him directions in his last will. This was observed for some time, ver. 10.'
      v:008:
        - '1MA:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Twelve.</i> Josephus, &c. Some add, a few months. He was about thirty-three years old.'
      v:010:
        - '1MA:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Death,</i> twelve years being expired, when all the posterity of Alexander [the Great] were dead. His generals gradually destroyed each other, and four took the diadem at the same time: Ptolemy, in Egypt; Seleucus, in Syria; Cassander, in Macedonia; and Lysimachus, in Thrace. (Just. xiii., and xv.) (Calmet) --- Those who choose to read in order, may, after the preface [in] 2 Machabees ii. 20., read the above, then 2 Machabees iii. 1. (Worthington)'
      v:011:
        - '1MA:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Antiochus the illustrious;</i> Epiphanes, the younger son of Antiochus the great, who usurped the kingdom, to the prejudice of his nephew Demetrius, son of his elder brother, Seleucus Philopater. (Challoner) --- Epiphanes means "renowed." (Worthington) --- He took this title, particularly after the Samaritans had offered it to him. (Josephus, Antiquities xii.; Vaillant. A. 145.) --- His medals have always <i>God</i> prefixed, "the god appearing;" as he came opportunely, like a god, to defend the kingdom against the Egyptians, after he had been fourteen years a hostage at Rome. (Calmet) --- Nothing could be more abject than his character. (St. Jerome, in Daniel viii., and ix.) (Atheneus v. 4., and x. 12.) --- <i>Greeks,</i> counting not from the beginning of the reign of Alexander [the Great], but from the first year of Seleucus Nicator. (Challoner) --- The era of the Seleucides began in spring or autumn, the year of the world 3692, the year before Christ 312, though the Chaldeans and Ptolemy date from the following spring. (Calmet) --- The Grecian monarchy had then stood twenty years. (Eusebius) (Worthington)'
      v:012:
        - '1MA:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Men.</i> Jason attempted to supplant Onias III and introduced pagan customs, when he was dead. Menelaus treated him in like manner. Being cited to pay what he had promised, he left Lysimachus in his place, who was slain in the temple, which he was robbing, 2 Machabees iv. --- <i>Us.</i> Thus the Jews complained in the days of Jeremias, (xliv. 18.) and the Christian religion was blamed for all the miseries which fell upon the Roman empire. (Calmet) --- St. Augustine proves in his City of God, that this accusation was false. (Haydock)'
      v:015:
        - '1MA:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Exercise,</i> to wrestle (Calmet) and teach. (Lyranus)'
      v:016:
        - '1MA:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Made.</i> St. Jerome thinks the attempt useless. But the Jews discovered the art. (St. Epiphanius; Pond. xvi.; Bartol.) (1 Corinthians vii. 18.) --- <i>Sold</i> to the devil, becoming his instruments, 3 Kings xxi. 25., and Romans vii. 14. (Calmet) --- Go to 2 Machabees iv. 7.'
      v:017:
        - '1MA:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Egypt.</i> He coveted this kingdom, having Syria already. (Worthington) --- He was not very fit for war: but Egypt was not under Philometor a child, and Ephphanes made an easy conquest. This was his second visit to that country. While he besieged Alexandria, a report of his death was spread; and as he was informed that the Jews rejoiced at it, he fell upon them, ver. 21. (Calmet) --- After ver. 20, read 2 Machabees iv. 21. (Worthington)'
      v:023:
        - '1MA:1:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Sanctuary.</i> Josephus (Antiquities xii. 6.) writes, that Antiochus slew such as opposed his entrance into the city, and afterwards those who opened the gates, but would have prevented his plundering the temple. (Worthington) --- Menelaus conducted the king, 2 Machabees v. 15. Profane authors condemn this conduct of the king towards a city subject to him. (Josephus, contra Apion 2.) --- Diodorus relates several fables on this occasion. (Calmet)'
      v:030:
        - '1MA:1:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>The chief collector,</i> &c. Apollonius. (Challoner) (2 Machabees v. 24.) (Worthington) --- He basely fell upon the unsuspecting citizens on a sabbath day. (Haydock)'
      v:033:
        - '1MA:1:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Fire,</i> thus destroying a great part. (Josephus, Antiquities xii. 7.)'
      v:035:
        - '1MA:1:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>The city of David.</i> That is, the castle of Sion. (Challoner) --- In it was placed a garrison of Macedonians. (Worthington) --- This castle had been occupied by Syrians before. It was now enlarged, 2 Machabees iv. 27., and v. 5.'
      v:038:
        - '1MA:1:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Sanctuary,</i> to pillage all who came to the temple. (Calmet) --- <i>An evil devil.</i> Literally, an adversary, watching constantly to do harm, as the evil spirit is always watching and seeking whom he could devour. (Challoner)'
      v:040:
        - '1MA:1:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Fled</i> with Judas, &c. (2 Machabees v.) Josephus (Antiquities xii. 7.) assures us that the Samaritans flattered Epiphanes, and begged their temple might be consecrated to Jupiter, &c. They pretended that they were of Sidonian extraction.'
      v:043:
        - '1MA:1:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Be one.</i> This reason herself teaches. But the king wished to establish a false religion, or rather he desired to root out all religion, and to shew his authority. (Haydock) --- <i>Demere superstitionem & mores Græcorum dare adnixus.</i> (Tacitus v.) --- He was not content with plunder, unless he ruined souls. (Worthington)'
      v:045:
        - '1MA:1:45 | 45 | 45 | <i>Service,</i> or worship, (Calmet) introduced by Epiphanes. (Haydock)'
      v:049:
        - 1MA:1:49 | 49 | 49 | <i>People.</i> He forced them to eat forbidden meat.
      v:057:
        - '1MA:1:57 | 57 | 57 | <i>Fifteenth.</i> In all other places the 25th, whence this may be incorrect, (Calmet) or the altar was now set up, (Haydock) though sacrifices were not yet offered. (Calmet) --- <i>Idol.</i> The statue of Jupiter Olympius, (Challoner) as Daniel (ix.) had foretold, as a figure of what antichrist would do, (Matthew xxiv.; Worthington) as well as the Romans, when they took Jerusalem.'
      v:058:
        - '1MA:1:58 | 58 | 58 | <i>Doors,</i> to Trivia, Isaias lvii. 8. (Calmet)'
      v:059:
        - '1MA:1:59 | 59 | 59 | <i>Law,</i> and all the sacred writings. (Josephus; Sulpitius ii.) --- The pious Jews secreted what they could, and Judas took care to collect them, 2 Machabees i. 14., and iii. 48. (Calmet)'
      v:061:
        - "1MA:1:61 | 61 | 61 | <i>After month.</i> The officers took an account of the slain, (Grotius) or the dedication of the statue was renewed, or rather the king's nativity was kept, 2 Machabees vi. 7. (Calmet) --- But this would only occur once a-year. People were compelled to sacrifice on the same day of each month on which the statue had been dedicated, ver. 62."
      v:062:
        - '1MA:1:62 | 62 | 62 | <i>Over-against,</i> or (Haydock) "upon," {GREEK:START epi}ηπι{GREEK:END}. The Greek altars were of a smaller size.'

        - '1MA:1:67 | 67 | 67 | <i>Wrath.</i> God seemed displeased, as he was with too many. The pious were exposed to various trials, and to the fury of persecutors. (Haydock) --- Read 2 Machabees v. 11. (Worthington)'

        - "1MA:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Joarib.</i> This family was the most distinguished, as Josephus, who sprung from it, asserts, (Haydock) being the first of the twenty-four families of priests, 1 Paralipomenon xxiv. 7, 19. (Menochius) --- Mathathias was probably a descendant of <i>Phinees,</i> (ver. 54.) and was officiating when the impious orders arrived. Whereupon he retired to Modin, (Calmet) near Diospolis. (St. Jerome) --- Many say he was chosen high priest; and therefore decided the question about fighting on the sabbath. But any other, in similar emergencies, might have given that decision. (Calmet) --- Judas was chosen, (Josephus) and Jonathas exercised the functions. (Antiquities xx. 8.) --- To verify the prediction of Jacob, some have concluded that the Machabees were allied to the tribe of Juda by the mother's side. (St. Jerome; St. Augustine, contra Faust. i. 72.) --- Yet this is not proved, nor requisite. They were called Asmoneans, either from the town of Asamon, (Josue xv. 27.) or from Assamoneus, great grandfather of Mathathias. (Josephus, Antiquities xii. 8.) --- This family ruled till Herod, 128 years. (Calmet) --- Here an account is given of their wars, and more fully in the eight last chapters of the second Book[2 Machabees]. (Worthington) --- Perhaps John, Mathathias, &c., were chosen high priests by the people, while the king sent others. (Selden)"

      v:004:
        - '1MA:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Machabeus.</i> The common etymology has been given [in the Introduction]. (Haydock) --- But Judas had then no banners, and there is no proof that the Jews used such abbreviations, (Calmet) though moderns write <i>Rambam,</i> for "R. Moses, son of Maimon," <i>Moce-bie,</i> (Haydock) "conquering in God," (equivalent to <i>Nicator,</i> the title of Sedeucus) seems better, particularly as the word is written <i>Machabee.</i> (Calmet) --- Yet this is liable to the objection of <i>c</i> being placed instead of <i>k,</i> which occurs invariably in the Chaldean and Syriac. (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - '1MA:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Abaron,</i> "passing," <i>undaunted,</i> (Calmet) or "potent." --- <i>Apphus,</i> "the wrath <i>or</i> flying of counsel," (Pagnin) "fainting, abundant, <i>or</i> dissipating." (Calmet) --- This small help, of great importance, was foretold by Daniel, xi. 34. (Worthington)'

      v:018:
        - '1MA:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>They.</i> Josephus mentions Apelles. Persecutors have thus frequently attempted to delude the faithful; first by flattery, and then by torments.'
      v:021:
        - 1MA:2:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Profitable.</i> But quite the reverse both for this world and for the next. It is a dreadful crime.

      v:037:
        - '1MA:2:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Innocency.</i> Literally, "simplicity," has often this sense. Their piety was not, however, enlightened, as the ceremonial law gives way on such occasions. (Calmet) --- Their simplicity is commended by St. Ambrose, Of. i. 40. Yet they had not the prudence of serpents, which is also requisite. The Church remains. (Worthington)'
      v:041:
        - "1MA:2:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Come up.</i> They say not that they will attack. (Calmet) --- Pompey perceived this, and made his advances and works on the sabbath, without opposition. (Josephus, Jewish Wars i. 5.) --- Pompey I had thus taken Jerusalem. (Josephus, Antiquities xii. 1.) --- The Samaritans will not move on that day. (Exodus xvi. 29.; ep. 2. ad Scaliger) --- The Jews now take care of the sick, but will not help a beast out of the ditch on the sabbath, though in our Saviour's time they did just the reverse, Luke xiv. 5. The law has thus been variously explained. The Machabees judged with prudence. Yet superstition had again gained ground, when Josephus (vita) would not fight or assemble his forces on the sabbath, as being contrary to the law. In a storm, a Jewish pilot abandoned the helm till the danger was evident. (Synes. ep. iv.)"

(Cornelius a Lapide) --- <i>Esidim</i> (Haydock) means "the pious," Ecclesiasticus xliv. 10. Many think they were the same with the Cinites, Rechabites, and Essenes. From them sprung the Pharisees. (Calmet) --- The society was intent on adorning the temple, (Scaliger) by which they swore, Matthew xxiii. 6. (Calmet) --- They were like monks in the old law. (Simon.) (Menochius) --- These Essenes followed piety, avoiding the hypocrisy and error of the Pharisees and Sadducees. (Worthington) (Josephus, Jewish Wars ii. 12.)'

      v:002: '1MA:2:2 | 2 | 2 | And he had five sons: John, who was surnamed Gaddis;'
      v:003: '1MA:2:3 | 3 | 3 | And Simon, who was surnamed Thasi;'
      v:004: '1MA:2:4 | 4 | 4 | And Judas, who was called Machabeus;'
      v:005: '1MA:2:5 | 5 | 5 | And Eleazar, who was surnamed Abaron; and Jonathan, who was surnamed Apphus.'
      v:006: '1MA:2:6 | 6 | 6 | These saw the evils that were done in the people of Juda, and in Jerusalem.'
      v:007: '1MA:2:7 | 7 | 7 | And Mathathias said: Wo is me, wherefore was I born to see the ruin of my people, and the ruin of the holy city, and to dwell there, when it is given into the hands of the enemies?'
      v:008: '1MA:2:8 | 8 | 8 | The holy places are come into the hands of strangers: her temple is become as a man without honour.'
      v:009: '1MA:2:9 | 9 | 9 | The vessels of her glory are carried away captive; her old men are murdered in the streets, and her young men are fallen by the sword of the enemies.'
      v:010: '1MA:2:10 | 10 | 10 | What nation hath not inherited her kingdom, and gotten of her spoils?'
      v:011: 1MA:2:11 | 11 | 11 | All her ornaments are taken away. She that was free is made a slave.
      v:012: '1MA:2:12 | 12 | 12 | And behold our sanctuary, and our beauty, and our glory is laid waste, and the Gentiles have defiled them.'
      v:013: 1MA:2:13 | 13 | 13 | To what end then should we live any longer?
      v:014: '1MA:2:14 | 14 | 14 | And Mathathias and his sons rent their garments, and they covered themselves with haircloth, and made great lamentation.'
      v:015: '1MA:2:15 | 15 | 15 | And they that were sent from king Antiochus, came thither, to compel them that were fled into the city of Modin, to sacrifice, and to burn incense, and to depart from the law of God.'
      v:016: '1MA:2:16 | 16 | 16 | And many of the people of Israel consented and came to them: but Mathathias and his sons stood firm.'
      v:017: '1MA:2:17 | 17 | 17 | And they that were sent from Antiochus, answering, said to Mathathias: Thou art a ruler, and an honourable, and great man in this city, and adorned with sons, and brethren.'
      v:018: "1MA:2:18 | 18 | 18 | Therefore, come thou first, and obey the king's commandment, as all nations have done, and the men of Juda, and they that remain in Jerusalem: and thou, and thy sons, shall be in the number of the king's friends, and enriched with gold, and silver, and many presents."
      v:019: '1MA:2:19 | 19 | 19 | Then Mathathias answered, and said with a loud voice: Although all nations obey king Antiochus, so as to depart every man from the service of the law of his fathers, and consent to his commandments:'
      v:020: '1MA:2:20 | 20 | 20 | I and my sons, and my brethren will obey the law of our fathers.'
      v:021: '1MA:2:21 | 21 | 21 | God be merciful unto us: it is not profitable for us to forsake the law, and the justices of God:'
      v:022: '1MA:2:22 | 22 | 22 | We will not hearken to the words of king Antiochus, neither will we sacrifice and transgress the commandments of our law, to go another way.'
      v:023: "1MA:2:23 | 23 | 23 | Now as he left off speaking these words, there came a certain Jew in the sight of all to sacrifice to the idols upon the altar in the city of Modin, according to the king's commandment."
      v:024: '1MA:2:24 | 24 | 24 | And Mathathias saw, and was grieved, and his reins trembled, and his wrath was kindled according to the judgment of the law, and running upon him he slew him upon the altar:'
      v:025: '1MA:2:25 | 25 | 25 | Moreover the man whom king Antiochus had sent, who compelled them to sacrifice, he slew at the same time, and pulled down the altar.'
      v:026: '1MA:2:26 | 26 | 26 | And shewed zeal for the law, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}as Phinees did by Zamri, the son of Salomi.'

      v:028: '1MA:2:28 | 28 | 28 | So he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that they had in the city.'
      v:029: '1MA:2:29 | 29 | 29 | Then many that sought after judgment, and justice, went down into the desert:'

      v:031: "1MA:2:31 | 31 | 31 | And it was told to the king's men, and to the army that was in Jerusalem, in the city of David, that certain men, who had broken the king's commandment, were gone away into the secret places in the wilderness, and that many were gone after them."

      v:034: "1MA:2:34 | 34 | 34 | And they said: We will not come forth, neither will we obey the king's edict, to profane the sabbath day."
      v:035: 1MA:2:35 | 35 | 35 | And they made haste to give them battle.
      v:036: '1MA:2:36 | 36 | 36 | But they answered them not, neither did they cast a stone at them, nor stopped up the secret places,'
      v:037: '1MA:2:37 | 37 | 37 | Saying: Let us all die in our innocency: and heaven and earth shall be witnesses for us, that you put us to death wrongfully.'
      v:038: '1MA:2:38 | 38 | 38 | So they gave them battle on the sabbath: and they were slain with their wives, and their children, and their cattle, to the number of a thousand persons.'
      v:039: '1MA:2:39 | 39 | 39 | And Mathathias and his friends heard of it, and they mourned for them exceedingly.'
      v:040: '1MA:2:40 | 40 | 40 | And every man said to his neighbour: If we shall all do as our brethren have done, and not fight against the heathens for our lives, and our justifications: they will now quickly root us out of the earth.'
      v:041: '1MA:2:41 | 41 | 41 | And they determined in that day, saying: Whosoever shall come up against us to fight on the sabbath day, we will fight against him: and we will not all die, as our brethren that were slain in the secret places.'
      v:042: '1MA:2:42 | 42 | 42 | Then was assembled to them the congregation of the Assideans, the stoutest of Israel, every one that had a good will for the law.'
      v:043: '1MA:2:43 | 43 | 43 | And all they that fled from the evils, joined themselves to them, and were a support to them.'
      v:044: '1MA:2:44 | 44 | 44 | And they gathered an army, and slew the sinners in their wrath, and the wicked men in their indignation: and the rest fled to the nations for safety.'
      v:045: '1MA:2:45 | 45 | 45 | And Mathathias and his friends went round about, and they threw down the altars:'
      v:046: '1MA:2:46 | 46 | 46 | And they circumcised all the children whom they found in the confines of Israel that were uncircumcised: and they did valiantly.'
      v:047: '1MA:2:47 | 47 | 47 | And they pursued after the children of pride, and the work prospered in their hands:'
      v:048: '1MA:2:48 | 48 | 48 | And they recovered the law out of the hands of the nations, and out of the hands of the kings: and they yielded not the horn to the sinner.'
      v:049: '1MA:2:49 | 49 | 49 | Now the days drew near that Mathathias should die, and he said to his sons: Now hath pride and chastisement gotten strength, and the time of destruction, and the wrath of indignation:'
      v:050: '1MA:2:50 | 50 | 50 | Now, therefore, O my sons, be ye zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers.'

      v:020: '1MA:4:20 | 20 | 20 | And Gorgias saw that his men were put to flight, and that they had set fire to the camp: for the smoke that was seen declared what was done.'
      v:021: '1MA:4:21 | 21 | 21 | And when they had seen this, they were seized with great fear, seeing at the same time Judas and his army in the plain ready to fight.'

      v:030: '1MA:4:30 | 30 | 30 | And they saw that the army was strong, and he prayed, and said: Blessed art thou, O Saviour of Israel, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}who didst break the violence of the mighty by the hand of thy servant David, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 1}and didst deliver up the camp of the strangers into the hands of Jonathan, the son of Saul, and of his armour-bearer.'

      v:037: '1MA:4:37 | 37 | 37 | And all the army assembled together, and they went up into Mount Sion.'
      v:038: '1MA:4:38 | 38 | 38 | And they saw the sanctuary desolate, and the altar profaned, and the gates burnt, and shrubs growing up in the courts as in a forest, or on the mountains, and the chambers joining to the temple thrown down.{VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}'

      v:003:
        - '1MA:5:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Idumea.</i> Alexandrian manuscript has, "Judea." Both may be right. The country had been wrested from Juda by the Idumeans. --- <i>Acrabathane</i> is "the ascent of scorpions," (<i>hakrabim</i>) which were probably numerous, to the south of the Dead Sea, Numbers xxxiv. 4., and Deuteronomy viii. 15.'
      v:004:
        - '1MA:5:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Bean;</i> perhaps Beon, near the sea of Sodom, (Calmet) or Bathaner, beyond the Jordan [River]. (Serarius)'
      v:005:
        - '1MA:5:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Destruction.</i> Sometimes the people were spared. All depended on the wording of the vow, Leviticus xxvii. 28., and Numbers xxi. 1. See other particulars, 2 Machabees x. 16., to 23. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - '1MA:5:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Gazer,</i> in Ephraim. But Jazer, in the tribe of Gad, seems to be meant, as the Greek expresses it. (Menochius) --- <i>Towns.</i> Literally, "daughters," or dependant (Haydock) villages. (Worthington) --- Afterwards Judas returned and defeated Timotheus, 2 Machabees x. 24.'
      v:009:
        - '1MA:5:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Galaad.</i> Most of the towns had been seized by the Ammonites, &c. After the return of the captives, they were probably driven out. They attempted to regain possession, when Epiphanes declared against the Jews. --- <i>Datheman;</i> Petra, (Calmet) or perhaps Rathma, Numbers xxxiii. 18. (Drusius)'
      v:011:
        - '1MA:5:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Timotheus.</i> Another of this name had been slain the preceding year, [the year of the world] 3840, at Gazara, 2 Machabees x. 37.'

        - '1MA:5:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Barasa;</i> probably the Bozra of Moab. Greek, "Bosorra." (Jos.[Josephus?]) --- <i>Bosor</i> means a fortress.

      v:041:
        - "1MA:5:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Afraid.</i> He interpreted the delay in this sense, which was very precarious, (Haydock) as nothing could be more superstitious. Jonathan begged for a similar proof of God's favour. But Timotheus consulted only himself, 1 Kings xiv. 9. (Calmet)"
      v:042:

      v:046:
        - "1MA:5:46 | 46 | 46 | <i>Ephron,</i> beyond the Jordan [River]. The situation is unknown. With regard to the right which Judas had to treat it with such severity, see Numbers xx. 18., and Judges viii. 5. (Calmet) --- It probably belonged to God's people, and was unjustly detained.

        - '1MA:5:54 | 54 | 54 | <i>Not one.</i> The 12,000 who defeated the Madianites, were preserved by God in like manner, Numbers xxxi. 49. (Haydock)'
      v:056:
        - '1MA:5:56 | 56 | 56 | <i>And Azarias.</i> These two are known only for their disobedience and misconduct. In holy wars, God does not favour those who are actuated by base motives, ver. 18, 60. (Calmet) --- Men who depend on themselves, and who are not properly authorized, receive not assistance from above; so these failed, as they were not chosen like those who were to save Israel, (Worthington) of the family of the Machabees. (Menochius)'
      v:058:
        - '1MA:5:58 | 58 | 58 | <i>Jamnia,</i> a maritime city of the Philistines near Joppe. Gorgias, an experienced warrior, had retired thither, chap. iv. 5., and 2 Machabees viii. 9. (Calmet)'
      v:062:
        - '1MA:5:62 | 62 | 62 | <i>Israel.</i> The late Rev. Robert Bannister applied this to Protestant writers of sermons, to dissuade young divines from applying to such authors as Tillotson, &c. It may also shew the reason why heretics succeed so ill in their foreign missions. (Haydock) --- They know how to pervert Catholics, not how to convert infidels. (Tertullian)'
      v:063:
        - '1MA:5:63 | 63 | 63 | <i>Men.</i> Greek, "man, Judas, and his brethren were," &c. (Haydock) --- See a similar expression [in] Exodus xiv. 3., respecting Moses.'
      v:065:
        - '1MA:5:65 | 65 | 65 | <i>Chebron,</i> or Hebron, which the Idumeans had seized. Judas retook it after he had defeated Gorgias, 2 Machabees xii. 32.'
      v:066:
        - '1MA:5:66 | 66 | 66 | <i>Aliens;</i> Philistines, ver. 68. --- <i>Samaria.</i> This seems too remote. Some substitute Saraia; (Jos.[Josue?] xv. 35.) others Maresa, (2 Machabees xii. 35.) Marissa, (Jos.[Josephus?]) the same as Ressa, Numbers xxxiii. 21.'
      v:067:
        - '1MA:5:67 | 67 | 67 | <i>Desiring.</i> They were only too brave. This quality was not incompatible with the priesthood. Greek Alexandrian has, "while he (Judas) was desiring," &c. Others have, "priests of the cities, while they," &c. The Roman edition agrees with us, (Calmet) and Grabe prints accordingly. (Haydock)'

      v:016: '1MA:5:16 | 16 | 16 | Now when Judas and all the people heard these words, a great assembly met together to consider what they should do for their brethren that were in trouble, and were assaulted by them.'
      v:017: '1MA:5:17 | 17 | 17 | And Judas said to Simon, his brother: Choose thee men, and go, and deliver thy brethren in Galilee: and I, and my brother Jonathan, will go into the country of Galaad:'
      v:018: '1MA:5:18 | 18 | 18 | And he left Joseph, the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of the people, with the remnant of the army in Judea, to keep it:'
      v:019: '1MA:5:19 | 19 | 19 | And he commanded them, saying: Take ye the charge of this people; but make no war against the heathens, till we return.'
      v:020: '1MA:5:20 | 20 | 20 | Now three thousand men were allotted to Simon, to go into Galilee: and eight thousand to Judas, to go into the land of Galaad.'
      v:021: '1MA:5:21 | 21 | 21 | And Simon went into Galilee, and fought many battles with the heathens: and the heathens were discomfited before his face, and he pursued them even to the gate of Ptolemais.'
      v:022: '1MA:5:22 | 22 | 22 | And there fell of the heathens almost three thousand men, and he took the spoils of them.'
      v:023: '1MA:5:23 | 23 | 23 | And he took with him those that were in Galilee and in Arbatis, with their wives, and children, and all that they had, and he brought them into Judea with great joy.'
      v:024: "1MA:5:24 | 24 | 24 | And {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Judas Machabeus, and Jonathan, his brother, passed over the Jordan, and went three days' journey through the desert."
      v:025: '1MA:5:25 | 25 | 25 | And the Nabutheans met them, and received them in a peaceable manner, and told them all that happened to their brethren in the land of Galaad,'
      v:026: '1MA:5:26 | 26 | 26 | And that many of them were shut up in Barasa, and in Bosor, and in Alima, and in Casphor, and in Mageth, and in Carnaim; all these strong and great cities.'
      v:027: '1MA:5:27 | 27 | 27 | Yea, and that they were kept shut up in the rest of the cities of Galaad, and that they had appointed to bring their army on the morrow near to these cities, and to take them, and to destroy them all in one day.'
      v:028: '1MA:5:28 | 28 | 28 | Then Judas and his army suddenly turned their march into the desert, to Bosor, and took the city: and he slew every male by the edge of the sword, and took all their spoils, and burnt it with fire.'
      v:029: '1MA:5:29 | 29 | 29 | And they removed from thence by night, and went till they came to the fortress.'
      v:030: '1MA:5:30 | 30 | 30 | And it came to pass that early in the morning, when they lifted up their eyes, behold there were people without number, carrying ladders and engines to take the fortress, and assault them.'
      v:031: '1MA:5:31 | 31 | 31 | And Judas saw that the fight was begun, and the cry of the battle went up to heaven like a trumpet, and a great cry out of the city:'
      v:032: '1MA:5:32 | 32 | 32 | And he said to his host: Fight ye to-day for your brethren.'
      v:033: '1MA:5:33 | 33 | 33 | And he came with three companies behind them, and they sounded their trumpets, and cried out in prayer.'
      v:034: '1MA:5:34 | 34 | 34 | And the host of Timotheus understood that it was Machabeus, and they fled away before his face: and they made a great slaughter of them: and there fell of them in that day almost eight thousand men.'
      v:035: '1MA:5:35 | 35 | 35 | And Judas turned aside to Maspha, and assaulted, and took it, and he slew every male thereof, and took the spoils thereof, and burnt it with fire.'
      v:036: '1MA:5:36 | 36 | 36 | From thence he marched, and took Casbon, and Mageth, and Bosor, and the rest of the cities of Galaad.'
      v:037: '1MA:5:37 | 37 | 37 | But after this Timotheus gathered another army, and camped over-against Raphon, beyond the torrent.'
      v:038: '1MA:5:38 | 38 | 38 | And Judas sent men to view the army: and they brought him word, saying: All the nations, that are round about us, are assembled unto him an army exceeding great:'
      v:039: '1MA:5:39 | 39 | 39 | And they have hired the Arabians to help them, and they have pitched their tents beyond the torrent, ready to come to fight against thee. And Judas went to meet them.'
      v:040: '1MA:5:40 | 40 | 40 | And Timotheus said to the captains of his army: When Judas and his army come near the torrent of water, if he pass over unto us first, we shall not be able to withstand him: for he will certainly prevail over us.'
      v:041: '1MA:5:41 | 41 | 41 | But if he be afraid to pass over, and camp on the other side of the river, we will pass over to them and shall prevail against him. 42 Now when Judas came near the torrent of water, he set the scribes of the people by the torrent, and commanded them, saying: Suffer no man to stay behind: but let all come to the battle.'
      v:043: '1MA:5:43 | 43 | 43 | And he passed over to them first, and all the people after him, and all the heathens were discomfited before them, and they threw away their weapons, and fled to the temple that was in Carnaim.'
      v:044: '1MA:5:44 | 44 | 44 | And he took that city, and the temple he burnt with fire, with all things that were therein: and Carnaim was subdued, and could not stand against the face of Judas.'
      v:045: '1MA:5:45 | 45 | 45 | And Judas gathered together all the Israelites that were in the land of Galaad, from the least even to the greatest, and their wives and children, and an army exceeding great, to come into the land of Juda.'
      v:046: '1MA:5:46 | 46 | 46 | And they came as far as Ephron: now this was a great city, situate in the way, strongly fortified, and there was no means to turn from it on the right hand or on the left, but the way was through the midst of it.'
      v:047: '1MA:5:47 | 47 | 47 | And they that were in the city, shut themselves in, and stopped up the gates with stones: and Judas sent to them with peaceable words,'
      v:048: '1MA:5:48 | 48 | 48 | Saying: Let us pass through your land, to go into our country: and no man shall hurt you; we will only pass through on foot. But they would not open to them.'
      v:049: '1MA:5:49 | 49 | 49 | Then Judas commanded proclamation to be made in the camp, that they should make an assault, every man in the place where he was.'
      v:050: '1MA:5:50 | 50 | 50 | And the men of the army drew near, and he assaulted that city all the day, and all the night; and the city was delivered into his hands:'
      v:051: '1MA:5:51 | 51 | 51 | And they slew every male with the edge of the sword; and he razed the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed through all the city over them that were slain.'
      v:052: 1MA:5:52 | 52 | 52 | Then they passed over the Jordan to the great plain that is over-against Bethsan.
      v:053: '1MA:5:53 | 53 | 53 | And Judas gathered together the hindmost, and he exhorted the people, all the way through, till they came into the land of Juda.'
      v:054: '1MA:5:54 | 54 | 54 | And they went up to Mount Sion with joy and gladness, and offered holocausts, because not one of them was slain, till they had returned in peace.'
      v:055: '1MA:5:55 | 55 | 55 | Now in the days that Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Galaad, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and Simon, his brother, in Galilee, before Ptolemais,'
      v:056: '1MA:5:56 | 56 | 56 | Joseph, the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captain of the soldiers, heard of the good success, and the battles that were fought,'
      v:057: '1MA:5:57 | 57 | 57 | And he said: Let us also get us a name, and let us go fight against the Gentiles that are round about us.'
      v:058: '1MA:5:58 | 58 | 58 | And he gave charge to them that were in his army, and they went towards Jamnia.'
      v:059: '1MA:5:59 | 59 | 59 | And Gorgias and his men went out of the city, to give them battle.'
      v:060: '1MA:5:60 | 60 | 60 | And Joseph and Azarias were put to flight, and were pursued unto the borders of Judea: and there fell on that day, of the people of Israel, about two thousand men, and there was a great overthrow of the people:'
      v:061: '1MA:5:61 | 61 | 61 | Because they did not hearken to Judas and his brethren, thinking that they should do manfully.'
      v:062: 1MA:5:62 | 62 | 62 | But they were not of the seed of those men by whom salvation was brought to Israel.
      v:063: '1MA:5:63 | 63 | 63 | And the men of Juda were magnified exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and of all the nations where their name was heard.'
      v:064: 1MA:5:64 | 64 | 64 | And people assembled to them with joyful acclamations.
      v:065: '1MA:5:65 | 65 | 65 | Then Judas and his brethren went forth and attacked the children of Esau, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}in the land towards the south, and he took Chebron and her towns: and he burnt the walls thereof, and the towers all round it.'
      v:066: '1MA:5:66 | 66 | 66 | And he removed his camp to go into the land of the aliens, and he went through Samaria.'
      v:067: '1MA:5:67 | 67 | 67 | In that day some priests fell in battle, while desiring to do manfully they went out unadvisedly to fight.'

The Roman copy, Syriac, Josephus, style the place Elymais, where the temple was. (Calmet) --- Profane authors agree that this temple was very rich, and that Epiphanes attempted to plunder it. (St. Jerome, in Daniel xi.) --- <i>Nanea.</i> Venus or Diana was the deity there adored, whom the king pretended he would marry, 2 Machabees i. 13., and ix. 2. (Calmet) --- The account of the death of Epiphanes is given to ver. 16., and 2 Machabees ix. (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - "1MA:6:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Battle.</i> It is not known whether Elymais belonged to the king. Strabo (16) observes it was very jealous of its liberty, which it maintained against the Persians and the successors of Alexander [the Great]. (Calmet) --- <i>Babylonia.</i> At last he returned towards the country of Babylon. But before he arrived, the news of his generals' bad success in Judea filled him with vexation, and brought on desperate diseases, ver. 8., and 2 Machabees ix. 5. (Worthington) --- He intended to pass by the country or city of Babylon, but was prevented by illness on the mountains which divide it from Persia."

        - '1MA:6:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Friends,</i> educated with him. He appointed him regent instead of Lysias. (Calmet) --- His son Eupator was only nine years old. (Appian.) --- He made him appear and be recognized by the army. Eupator means one "born of a good father." (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - '1MA:6:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Nine.</i> He began his persecution the year [of the kingdom of the Greeks?] 143, so that it lasted six years and almost four months, or 2300 days, (Daniel viii. 14.) during which time Judas purified the temple, some months before the death of Epiphanes. (Worthington)'
      v:020:
        - "1MA:6:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Fifty.</i> How then was peace made in [the year of the kingdom of the Greeks?] 148, as we read [in] 2 Machabees xi. 21.? Usher ([the year of the world] 3841) supposes the era was reckoned according to the Chaldean custom, which defers it six months. Basnage (ii. 1.) rather thins that the letter is placed out of its proper order, and should occur at the beginning of Eupator's reign. See 2 Machabees x. --- <i>Slings,</i> or to thrown stones, &c., <i>ballistas.</i> (Haydock) --- The Greek and Josephus rather indicate terraces, or towers where the machines were placed."
      v:030:
        - '1MA:6:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Hundred.</i> The 2 Machabees xi. 2., specifies 80,000. But it speaks of a subsequent action.'
      v:031:
        - '1MA:6:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Idumea.</i> The passes on the north were probably occupied. --- <i>Bethsura</i> lay to the south of Jerusalem. (Calmet)'
      v:032:
        - '1MA:6:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Bethzacharam,</i> a defile (Josephus) between the city and Bethsura. Judas abandoned the siege of the castle on Sion. (Calmet)'
      v:034:
        - '1MA:6:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Blood of grapes,</i> or wine, (Deuteronomy xxxii. 14.) and the juice of mulberries incite elephants to fight, as the smell of some sorts of blood causes dogs to hunt. (Vales. Phil. lxxxii.) (Worthington) --- This might be done to accustom the elephants to the sight of blood. (Calmet) --- White colours irritate them most, as red do bulls. (Plutarch, de Fort. Alex.) --- Sometimes wine and spirits were given them to drink, when they were to trample on criminals: but it was only shewn them when going to battle, as by drinking they lose their strength. (Elian, Hist. ii. 40., and xiii. 8., and 3 Machabees v. 30.)'
      v:037:
        - '1MA:6:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Thirty-two.</i> Bochart looks upon this and other such accounts as fabulous. He does not determine how many might fight in these towers; but allows that there must have been above two or three, as some would correct the Greek text, "two or three strong men fighting with darts upon them." An elephant has been known to carry above 5000 pounds, and thirty-two men would weigh no more than 4800. Pliny ([Natural History?] viii. 7.) observes that sixty people have been seen upon an elephant. Eupator probably had his from India, where they are larger than in Africa. A person of that country was deemed fittest to manage them.'
      v:038:
        - '1MA:6:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Trumpets.</i> It would seem as if the infantry had none. Yet this does not appear probable. The Greek reads in a different manner. Some copies have "to stir up and enclose them in the defiles," which seems useless; or "to keep them together in the phalanxes," (Alexandrian manuscript; Calmet) as the Vulgate has read. (Menochius)'
      v:039:
        - '1MA:6:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Gold.</i> The Argyraspides of Alexander [the Great] had "shields of silver." His successors might surpass this magnificence; or the officers might have golden and the soldiers brazen bucklers.'
      v:042:
        - '1MA:6:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>Six,</i> &c., before the exploit of Eleazer. Others fell afterwards, 2 Machabees xi. 11., specifies 11,000 foot, and 600 horse. Josephus says 1000 of the vanguard.'
      v:043:
        - '1MA:6:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Saura.</i> Greek, "Avaron," (Calmet) Alexandrian, "the Sauaran." (Haydock) --- He is styled Abaron, (chap. ii. 5.) the brother of Judas. (Calmet) (Josephus) (Sa) (Menochius) --- Arabic says "his servant." This feat is attributed to Judas, (2 Machabees xiii. 15.) as he was general, and approved of, or "commanded" Eleazar to act thus, according to Ben. Gorion, (iii. 20.) and the Arabic. --- <i>Harness,</i> for greater security. The skin is very hard, except under the belly. (Calmet) --- Elephants in the army of Antiochus the great, or rather "the coward," were richly adorned. (Flor. ii. 8.) --- Porus, king of India, rode on one covered with gold. (Curtius viii.)'
      v:044:
        - '1MA:6:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>Name.</i> This motive has made some condemn the exploit. But surely a person may seek to acquire fame, even by exposing himself to danger. Eleazar might well hope that the beast would not fall so suddenly. The other motive specified is truly noble and virtuous, and we cannot condemn this hero without stronger proofs. St. Gregory (Mor. xix. 13.) represents him as a figure of the proud: but he might not therefore be one of the number, (Calmet) no more than Esau, who was a type of the reprobate, Malachias i. 3. (Haydock) --- St. Ambrose (Off. i. 40.) highly commends the fortitude of this soldier exposing himself to the danger of death for religion. (Worthington) --- This is the general sentiment. See Serarius; Menochius; Tirinus; and Grotius, jure. iii. 4. a. 18.'
      v:046:

      v:047:
        - '1MA:6:47 | 47 | 47 | <i>Them.</i> Judas thought proper to retire to the temple, which alone was fortified, and in his power. The citadel of Sion held for the king, and the city was defenceless. Only what lay to the north of Bethsura was then called Judea. The Idumeans occupied the rest. Eupator blockaded the temple, and besieged Bethsura, which he took, ver. 41. This siege is related more at length, 2 Machabees xii. 19. It cost the king a great deal. (Calmet)'
      v:051:

      v:055:
        - '1MA:6:55 | 55 | 55 | <i>King.</i> Lysias had thus been displaced, ver. 14. (Calmet) --- Providence permitted that he should seek his own interest, and thus deliver Judas from the most imminent danger.'

      v:007: '1MA:6:7 | 7 | 7 | And that they had thrown down the abomination which he had set up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassed about the sanctuary with high walls as before, and Bethsura also, his city.'

The king and Lysias sent to exculpate themselves, but received no satisfactory answer. Demetrius thought this a proper opportunity for regaining the throne. He consulted the historian, Polybius, who advised him to depart privately. He, however, addressed the senate for leave, and being refused, fled with eight attendants to Tripoli, and thence to Apamea. His rivals durst not attack him, as he pretended to be sent by the Romans. The army of Eupator seized their king and Lysias, and put them to death.

(Haydock) --- They comply with their just requests. (Menochius) --- The Scripture speaks of the fine times of the republic, and gives this temporal reward to the virtues of the Romans, which they so greatly sought, and to which alone they were entitled. (Calmet) --- "Hitherto, says Florus, the Roman people was beautiful, noble, pious, holy, and magnificent." The Jews, first among the eastern nations, employed their friendship to secure their liberty. <i>Facile tunc Romanis de alieno largientibus,</i> Just. xxxvi.'

Twenty hostages were required to be exchanged every three years. --- <i>Upon.</i> Greek, "the division," (Calmet) or all Europe, and from Halys as far as Mount Taurus.

The first of the consuls wore the ornaments. (Livy) --- It would have been more dreadful to have two than one ruler. (Worthington) --- One of them governed at home; the other in the armies, and this latter alone was known to the Jews. They might also be falsely informed that a dictator was chosen every year. This was only done on great emergencies. (Calmet) --- <em>No envy,</em> &c. So Judas had heard; and it was so far true, with regard to the ancient Romans: that as yet no envy or jealousy had divided them into such open factions and civil wars, as they afterwards experienced in the time of Marius and Sylla, &c.

Yet Rupert and Peter of Blois (ep. 146.) disapprove of the Jews having recourse to the Romans: they might flee away. It is not lawful to take arms against the sovereign. God had, however, sufficiently evinced by miracles that the conduct of the Machabees was pleasing to him, 2 Machabees xv. 12. (Calmet) --- The Jews were not properly subjects, though tributary to foreign kings, whose design was to exterminate them, chap. iii. 39. Self-preservation dictated that they should call in the aid of others. (Haydock) --- To die for religion was a great blessing. (Calmet) --- But God would not have his people thus entirely destroyed. The obligations of rulers and of the people are reciprocal. All nations have asserted their right to seek redress under oppression. Yet few have been treated so ill as the Jews. Few have acted with equal zeal and justice. (Haydock)'

(Haydock) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] xii. 17.) erroneously supposes that Alcimus was dead, and Judas his successor, while Simon was the civil ruler and general. He[Josephus] elsewhere (B.[Antiquities?] xx. 8.) asserts that Jonathas was next high priest to Alcimus, who certainly officiated after the death of Judas, ver. 54. --- <i>Bacchides</i> had been already in Judea, chap. vii. 8. Now the <i>right wing,</i> composed of the best troops, and usually commanded by the prince when he was present, is entrusted to him."

(Haydock) --- He seems to have thought God required him now to fight, and he was convinced that he could save by means of a few, which excuses him from rashness. The Church adopts his words, (Dom. iii. Oct. Mat.) and St. Ambrose (Of. i. 41.) highly extols his bravery, in "prefering death before slavery and shame."'
      v:012:
        - '1MA:9:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Legion.</i> So the Vulgate commonly renders Greek "phalanx," (Calmet) a compact body of 8000 men, used by the Macedonians.

Thus died this great man <i>who saved Israel,</i> ver. 21. (Calmet) --- <i>Gloriosiorem triumphis mortem invenit.</i> The most mighty in the sight of men may fall; but the fortitude of Judas, proved by former heroic actions and by success, was now rendered perfect by this most glorious death. (St. Ambrose, Of. i. 41.) (Worthington) --- Never was there a more accomplished and virtuous champion. He had all the qualities of a holy priest and a valiant soldier, as well as of a religious prince, always bent on promoting the glory of his people, chap. iii. 3. He was an admirable copy of Jesus Christ, the great original of all the saints. In the most dismal times he was chosen to save religion and the people. Almost alone, and wandering from place to place, he gains the most signal victories, forms a league with Gentiles, purifies the temple, acts both as high priest and as prince of the nation, and at last gives his life for his brethren. Thus Christ by his life and death unites all in one Church, and procures the remission of sin. (Calmet)'

(Worthington) --- Others say that he was illegitimate, and styled Ballas after his mother Bala, though the name in Syriac may denote "a worthless person." In his medals he styles himself <i>Deopator Eúergetes,</i> as if "God were his father," and himself "beneficent." (Calmet) (Usher, the year [of the world] 3851.) --- At any rate the Romans and Egyptians acknowledged him, being glad to find a rival for Demetrius, who was become odious likewise to the Jews and Syrians. Heraclides had been deprived of his government (Calmet) by the king, (chap. vii. 8.) and in revenge (Haydock) took Alexander, and Laodicea, daughter of Epiphanes, to Rome, where he gained over many of the senators, who agreed to help them to recover the kingdom. Heraclides then levied forces at Ephesus, and Ptolemais was delivered up to Alexander, whence he wrote to Jonathan. Nothing contributed more than these divisions to secure the liberty of the Jews.'

(Haydock) --- He had given him his daughter for the same purpose; and now, when Demetrius asserted his claims, he pretended that he would defend his son-in-law, and was thus admitted into all the towns. At Ptolemais he declared his real design, still pretending that Alexander had laid snares for him. While the latter was raising forces in Cilicia, he took Antioch, where he placed two diadems on his head; slew the cruel Ammonius, who had chiefly irritated the people against his master; gave the wife of Alexander to Demetrius; and, in conjunction with him, went to attack Alexander near the river Œnoparas. Here he received some mortal wounds; though Alexander was routed, and soon after slain in Arabia. (Livy lii.) (Usher, the year [of the world] 3858.)'

        - '1MA:14:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Two.</i> It is not easy to conceive why Josephus and Grotius place this expedition before the death of young Antiochus, chap. xiii. 31, 41. Demetrius was become contemptible, and had a mine to regain his reputation by attacking the Parthians, who had taken many provinces under the prudent conduct of Mithridates. The Greeks were impatient of this yoke. Many []ked[flocked?] to Demetrius, and he gained several victories; but after two years, was perfidiously taken by a general of the Parthians while treating of peace. Mithridates took him for a warning through the places which seemed favourable to him; but afterwards he sent him into Hyrcania, gave him his daughter in marriage, with the badges of royalty, and promises of restoring him to his kingdom. --- <i>Tryphon.</i> After the misfortune of Demetrius, he abandoned himself to his pleasures; and his adherents put themselves under Cleopatra, the wife of his rival, who resided at Seleucia, upon the Orontes.

(Worthington) --- When the latter went beyond the Euphrates [River], he wandered for fear of Tryphon, till he found rest at Rhodes, where he heard of his brother's misfortune, and was invited by his wife to marry her. He therefore took the title of <i>king,</i> when he wrote to Simon form the <i>isle</i> of Rhodes. Soon after he landed (Calmet) at Seleucia, and married Cleopatra, who was indignant that her husband had taken to wife the daughter of Mithridates. (Just. xxxvi.) --- Tryphon's adherents flocked to him: <i>exolescente favore recentis imperii.</i> (Trog. xxxix.; Eusebius) --- Demetrius was styled Sidetes, either because he came from Side, in Pamphylia, or because he was fond of \"hunting.\" Yet his medals have, \"Euergetes.\" (Vaillant; Usher, the year [of the world] 3864.)

      v:016:
        - '1MA:16:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Plentifully.</i> Literally, "were inebriated."

(Worthington) --- What is preserved in the seven middle chapters in the Arabic version is given by Calmet, who omits the 19 first and 32 last chapters. The whole has been published by Desprez. It differs in many points from Josephus, in the history of Hircan. The year [of the world] 3869, Sidetes besieges the new governor in Jerusalem, and after granting him a truce, during the octave of tabernacles, makes peace on very hard terms. Hircan takes money from the tomb of David, or rather from the secret treasures of the kings of Juda, and attends the king in his expedition into Persia, where Sidetes is slain, and the Macedonian yoke is entirely thrown off. (The year [of the world] 3874.) The pontiff obliges the Idumeans to receive circumcision the following year. In [the year of the world] 3877, he renews the alliance with the Romans. (4 Machabees iii.) Soon after, the Jews write to their brethren in Alexandria, 2 Machabees i. 10. In [the year of the world] 3894, Hircan undertakes the siege of Samaria, which his two sons continue. They defeat Antiochus of Cizicum, while Hircan puts Lathyrus to flight, and Samaria is razed to the ground. After a reign of twenty-nine years, Hircan dies. (The year [of the world] 3898.) (Eusebius, Dem. viii. 2.) (Calmet) --- Aristobulus, Alexander, and Hircan, his children, succeed in order. Alexander Janneus, the son of the last, reigns prosperously, and his widow is afterwards regent for nine years. Her eldest son, Hircan, being opposed by Aristobulus, the interference of Pompey is desired. He takes the latter prisoner to Rome, the year 3955, when Augustus came into the world. --- Cæsar being made dictator, liberated Aristobulus, who was now pontiff; but Pompey caused him, and Alexander, his son, to be slain. Antipater, who had adhered to Hircan, procures Phasael and Herod, his sons, to be made governors of Judea and Galilee. The latter married Mariamne, daughter of Hircan, and the last of the Asmonean family, whom he afterwards put to death. He wrests the kingdom from Aristobolus[Aristobulus?]; and having offended the people by some heathenish structures in compliment to Augustus, endeavours to please them by rebuilding the temple, the year [of the world] 3982. Not long after, Christ appeared; and thus we are brought to the more happy days of the gospel. (Haydock)'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "<b>These</b> Books are so called, because they contain the history of the people of God under the command of <i>Judas Machabeus</i> and his brethren; and he, as some will have it, was surnamed <i>Machabeus</i> from carrying on his ensigns, or standards, those words of Exodus xv. 11., \"Who is like to thee among the strong, O Lord;\" in which the initial letters, in the Hebrew, are M. C. B. E. I. It is not known who was the author of these books. But as to their authority, though they are not received by the Jews, saith St. Augustine, (liber[book] xviii., City of God, chap. xxxvi.) they are received by the Church; who, in settling her canon of the Scriptures, chose rather to be directed by the tradition she had received from the apostles of Christ, than by that of the Scribes and Pharisees. And as the Church has declared these two books canonical, even in two general councils, viz., Florence and Trent, there can be no doubt of their authenticity. (Challoner) --- The most ancient Fathers, Clement [of Alexandria], (Strom. i.) St. Cyprian, (1 ep. iii. ad. Cornel.) St. Ambrose, (Off. i. 41., &c.) quote them as divine; and the third Council of Carthage, Trent, &c., have inserted them in the canon. Though (Worthington) St. Jerome did not translate (Calmet) or urge them against the Jews, he had a great regard for them. (In Daniel i., and xi., &c.) The texts to which Protestants object, will be explained. They are not more difficult than many which occur in the Books of Kings and Paralipomenon. Other books have been formerly contested, which they now admit. The author of the second book seems to have designed at first only to insert two supplements. He then resolved to abridge the work of Jason, and hence added a preface, (chap. ii. 20.) which may be first perused. He then gives an account of some who had suffered death for the truth; and in the eighth and following chapters, the victories of the Machabees, which had been partly recorded in the first book, are specified, with some fresh circumstances. Judas was styled the Machabee for his strength and valour, (Worthington) being \"the scourge\" of God, (Haydock) or because he was an exterminator. (Menochius) --- Yet the etymology is not well ascertained. That given above, (Zacharias xii. 5.; Haydock) or M. C. B. I. (Buxtorf; Prideaux, &c.) seems to be overthrown, by the Syriac having always <i>k</i> instead of <i>c,</i> which is the case in two Chaldean manuscripts. These may not contain a truer history, but they rectify several mistakes in the printed copies. (Kennicott) --- St. Jerome found the first of these books in Hebrew, the second in Greek. (Ep. 106.) We have a third also in Greek, in the Complutensian Bible; as well as a fourth, mentioned by Sixtus, (Bib. i.; Worthington) \"on the administration of Hircan,\" (Calmet) to which reference seems to be made [in] 1 Machabees xv. 24., (Worthington) though what is extant be a work of no authority. \"The empire of reason,\" falsely attributed to Josephus, and printed among his works, is more probably the fourth book, known to the ancients. Neither of these latter were ever deemed canonical by any authentic decree. (Worthington) --- Many have indeed ranked the with the other contested works: but now it is generally agreed that they belong not to the sacred Scriptures, as the two former do. On these (Calmet) indeed, as almost on all the sacred books, (Haydock) authors have varied: but he most respectable and the most numerous declare in their favour. To arrange the four books in chronological order, we must make the first and third exchange places. This last can obtain its title only inasmuch as the Jews of Alexandria, who were persecuted by Philopator, and miraculously delivered, were animated with the same sentiments of piety and heroism as the rest of the Machabees. (Calmet) See Ecclesiasticus l. 1, 21, 23. (Haydock) --- The authors of the first and second books relate many of the same events; yet seem not to have seen each other's works. The latter follows the Greek chronology, dating from <i>Tisri,</i> September and October, (Calmet) the year of the world 3828 to 3843, (Haydock) while the former dates from <i>Nisan,</i> (Calmet) our March or April, the year 3829 to 3869. The third book gives an account of Philopator's persecution in Egypt, the year 3787. The fourth, from the year 3869 to 3698, (Haydock) is little known among the Latins. Calmet gives two copies, the one regarding Hircan and the other \"the government of reason,\" or the martyrdom of the Machabees, the year 3837; (Haydock) the author of which last seems to have been a Stoic. (Calmet) --- We shall pass them[3 Machabees and 4 Machabees] over, with Protestants, as they are not received by the Catholic Church. (Haydock)"
