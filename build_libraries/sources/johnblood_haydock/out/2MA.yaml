    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '2MA:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Egypt.</i> They are invited to worship at Jerusalem. (Menochius) --- It seems these were most considered; perhaps being more numerous. (Calmet) --- They had also a schismatical temple. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - '2MA:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Demetrius</i> Nicator. The date refer to what goes before. --- <i>Nine.</i> This author dates from autumn, whereas the preceding begins the era of Seleucides, in spring, which accounts for the apparent contradictions. (Calmet) --- <i>Trouble.</i> As they had written when in distress, so they now testify their joy and gratitude to God, begging their brethren to keep the dedication of the new altar. (Worthington) --- This first letter, sent during the heat of the persecution raised by Epiphanes, is lost. --- <i>Kingdom.</i> Judea was then tributary to Egypt; yet Jason applied to the Syrian monarch, and instead of waiting for the death of Onias III, wished to purchase his dignity, and to change the manners of the people. Josephus gives contradictory accounts of these affairs, (Calmet) if he be really the author of 4 Machabees. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - '2MA:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Flour,</i> (<i>mincha</i>) including corn, &c. After Judas had purified the temple, the usual sacrifices were offered. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - '2MA:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Scenopegia;</i> viz., the <i>encenia,</i> or feast of the dedication of the altar, called here <i>scenopegia,</i> or feast of the tabernacles, from being celebrated with the like solemnity. (Challoner) (Chap. x. 6.) --- The real feast occurs in the month of Tisri. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - '2MA:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Eight.</i> Thus the preceding letter is dated, according to many, (Menochius) as there was no Judas or Aristobolus known at this time. But Judas, the Essene prophet, (chap. ii. 14.; Worthington) must have flourished about that period; (Josephus, Antiquities xiii. 19.; Calmet) and one Aristobolus wrote something in the Scripture for Philometor. (Clement [of Alexander], Strom. v.; Eusebius, Hist. ii. 17.) --- After Philadelphus, the kings of Egypt had commonly Jews among their preceptors. (Rupert, Vict. x. 15.) --- This person is supposed to have instructed Physcon. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - '2MA:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>King.</i> Antiochus Sidetes, who began to make war upon the Jews, while Simon was yet alive; (1 Machabees xv. 39.) and afterwards besieged Jerusalem, under John Hircanus. So that the Judas here mentioned (ver. 10.) is not Judas Machabeus, who was dead long before the year 188 of the kingdom of the Greeks, for he died in the year 146 of that epoch; (see above, 1 Machabees ii. 70., also the note on chap. i. 2.) but either Judas, the eldest son of John Hircanus, or Judas the Essene, renowned for the gift of prophecy, who flourished about that time. (Challoner) --- Epiphanes may as well be meant. The ancestors of those who wrote resisted him.'
      v:012:
        - '2MA:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Persia.</i> This country is not specified in the Roman and Alexandrian Septuagint. Other copies have, "He <i>God</i> made them who attacked the holy city flee in swarms to Persia." (Syriac; Vatable) --- The name of Persia now comprised all the dominions of Antiochus; Rupert understands Sidetes. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - '2MA:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Nanea.</i> A Persian goddess, which some have taken for Diana, others for Venus. (Challoner) --- Her temple at Ecbatana was renowned, 1 Machabees vi. 1.'
      v:014:
        - '2MA:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Dowry.</i> Thus the pagans played with religion. (Menochius) --- Anthony having espoused the Minerva of Athens, required the city to give him 1000 talents for her portion. (Dion. Seneca, suasov. 1.) --- Heliogabalus and Caligula pretended to marry the celestial Venus or the moon. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - '2MA:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Slew.</i> Literally, "struck." Greek, "stoned." Yet Epiphanes escaped, (chap. x. 9., and 1 Machabees vi.) having received some wounds. But a fall from his chariot, and vexation, hastened his death. (Haydock) --- Some of his followers, who had advanced farther into the temple, perished. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - '2MA:1:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Scenopegia.</i> The dedication was observed by the people bearing branches, in memory of their late forlorn condition on the mountains. (Haydock) --- See ver. 2. --- <i>Fire.</i> This feast occurred in Tisri, 2 Esdras viii. 1, 14. (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - '2MA:1:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Persia.</i> Babylonia, called here Persia, from being afterwards a part of the Persian empire. (Challoner) --- Thus St. Chrysostom (H. 6. in Mat.) says, the Jews were delivered from "the Persian captivity." (Worthington) --- All beyond the Euphrates [River] was now called Persia. --- <i>Valley</i> of Topheth, where (Calmet) it is still shewn. (Doubdan.) --- The miraculous pit was enclosed by Artaxerxes, chap. v. 33. (Haydock) --- Four miracles occurred respecting this fire, ver. 20, 22, 32. (Worthington)'
      v:021:
        - '2MA:1:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>The priest.</i> Greek, "Nehemias ordered the priests to sprinkle with the water both," &c. (Haydock) --- Modern Jews say the sacred fire was not in the second temple. But Gorionides and 4 Machabees admit this fact. (Calmet) --- Elias obtained fire upon his sacrifice nearly in the same manner. (Haydock)'
      v:023:
        - "2MA:1:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Jonathan,</i> one of the chief priests; perhaps Joiada, Eliasib's son. (Calmet)"
      v:029:
        - '2MA:1:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Spoken,</i> promising these favours, Deuteronomy xxx. 3. (Haydock)'
      v:032:
        - '2MA:1:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Altar.</i> This second flame came immediately from heaven, and overpowered that proceeding from the mud. (Calmet)'
      v:034:
        - '2MA:1:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>A temple.</i> That is, an enclosure or a wall round about the place where the fire was hid, to separate it from profane uses, to the end that it might be respected as a holy place. (Challoner) --- Such open enclosures are often styled temples. (Calmet) --- Greek, "But the king enclosing it, made it sacred, ({GREEK:START ieron}ιηρον{GREEK:END}) having examined the fact." (Haydock)'
      v:035:
        - 2MA:1:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Hand.</i> The copies vary much. (La Haye.)
      v:036:
        - '2MA:1:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Nephthar,</i> or rather Necphar. (Grotius) --- <i>Nephi.</i> Greek has the former word. Roman copy and Syriac, Naphtai; may be derived from Chaldean <i>phetir,</i> "pure, unmixed." (Calmet) --- Nephthar may signify "deliverance," as sacred things are rescued from common use. (Worthington)'

    verses:
      v:001: '2MA:1:1 | 1 | 1 | To the brethren, the Jews that are throughout Egypt; the brethren, the Jews that are in Jerusalem, and in the land of Judea, send health and good peace.'
      v:002: '2MA:1:2 | 2 | 2 | May God be gracious to you, and remember his covenant that he made with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, his faithful servants:'
      v:003: '2MA:1:3 | 3 | 3 | And give you all a heart to worship him, and to do his will with a great heart, and a willing mind.'
      v:004: '2MA:1:4 | 4 | 4 | May he open your heart in his law, and in his commandments, and send you peace.'
      v:005: '2MA:1:5 | 5 | 5 | May he hear your prayers, and be reconciled unto you, and never forsake you in the evil time.'
      v:006: 2MA:1:6 | 6 | 6 | And now here we are praying for you.
      v:007: '2MA:1:7 | 7 | 7 | When Demetrius reigned, in the year {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}one hundred and sixty-nine, we Jews wrote to you in the trouble and violence that came upon us in those years, after Jason withdrew himself from the holy land, and from the kingdom.'
      v:008: '2MA:1:8 | 8 | 8 | They burnt the gate, and shed innocent blood: then we prayed to the Lord, and were heard, and we offered sacrifices, and fine flour, and lighted the lamps, and set forth the loaves.'
      v:009: '2MA:1:9 | 9 | 9 | And now celebrate ye the days of scenopegia, in the month of Casleu.'
      v:010: '2MA:1:10 | 10 | 10 | In the year {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}one hundred and eighty-eight, the people that is at Jerusalem, and in Judea, and the senate, and Judas, to Aristobolus, the preceptor of king Ptolemee, who is of the stock of the anointed priests, and to the Jews that are in Egypt, health and welfare.'
      v:011: '2MA:1:11 | 11 | 11 | Having been delivered by God out of great dangers, we give him great thanks, forasmuch as we have been in war with such a king.'
      v:012: '2MA:1:12 | 12 | 12 | For he made numbers of men swarm out of Persia, that have fought against us, and the holy city.'
      v:013: '2MA:1:13 | 13 | 13 | For when the leader himself was in Persia, and with him a very great army, he fell in the temple of Nanea, being deceived by the counsel of the priests of Nanea.'
      v:014: '2MA:1:14 | 14 | 14 | For Antiochus, with his friends, came to the place as though he would marry her, and that he might receive great sums of money under the title of a dowry.'
      v:015: '2MA:1:15 | 15 | 15 | And when the priests of Nanea had set it forth, and he with a small company had entered into the compass of the temple, they shut the temple,'
      v:016: '2MA:1:16 | 16 | 16 | When Antiochus was come in: and opening a secret entrance of the temple, they cast stones and slew the leader, and them that were with him, and hewed them in pieces; and cutting off their heads they threw them forth.'
      v:017: '2MA:1:17 | 17 | 17 | Blessed be God in all things, who hath delivered up the wicked.'
      v:018: '2MA:1:18 | 18 | 18 | Therefore, whereas we purpose to keep the purification of the temple on the five and twentieth day of the month of Casleu, we thought it necessary to signify it to you: that you also may keep the day of scenopegia, and the day of the fire, that was given when Nehemias offered sacrifice, after the temple and the altar was built.'
      v:019: '2MA:1:19 | 19 | 19 | For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests that then were worshippers of God, took privately the fire from the altar, and hid it in a valley where there was a deep pit without water, and there they kept it safe, so that the place was unknown to all men.'
      v:020: '2MA:1:20 | 20 | 20 | But when many years had passed, and it pleased God that Nehemias should be sent by the king of Persia, he sent some of the posterity of those priests that had hid it, to seek for the fire: and as they told us, they found no fire, but thick water.'
      v:021: '2MA:1:21 | 21 | 21 | Then he bade them draw it up, and bring it to him: and the priest, Nehemias, commanded the sacrifices that were laid on, to be sprinkled with the same water, both the wood, and the things that were laid upon it.'
      v:022: '2MA:1:22 | 22 | 22 | And when this was done, and the time came that the sun shone out, which before was in a cloud, there was a great fire kindled, so that all wondered.'
      v:023: '2MA:1:23 | 23 | 23 | And all the priests made prayer, while the sacrifice was consuming, Jonathan beginning, and the rest answering.'
      v:024: '2MA:1:24 | 24 | 24 | And the prayer of Nehemias was after this manner: O <strong>Lord</strong> God, Creator of all things, dreadful and strong, just and merciful, who alone art the good king,'
      v:025: '2MA:1:25 | 25 | 25 | Who alone art gracious, who alone art just, and almighty, and eternal, who deliverest Israel from all evil, who didst choose the fathers, and didst sanctify them:'
      v:026: '2MA:1:26 | 26 | 26 | Receive the sacrifice for all thy people Israel, and preserve thy own portion, and sanctify it.'
      v:027: '2MA:1:27 | 27 | 27 | Gather together our scattered people, deliver them that are slaves to the Gentiles, and look upon them that are despised and abhorred: that the Gentiles may know that thou art our God.'
      v:028: '2MA:1:28 | 28 | 28 | Punish them that oppress us, and that treat us injuriously with pride.'
      v:029: '2MA:1:29 | 29 | 29 | Establish thy people in thy holy place, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}as Moses hath spoken.'
      v:030: 2MA:1:30 | 30 | 30 | And the priests sung hymns till the sacrifice was consumed.
      v:031: '2MA:1:31 | 31 | 31 | And when the sacrifice was consumed, Nehemias commanded the water that was left to be poured out upon the great stones.'
      v:032: '2MA:1:32 | 32 | 32 | Which being done, there was kindled a flame from them: but it was consumed by the light that shined from the altar.'
      v:033: '2MA:1:33 | 33 | 33 | And when this matter became public, it was told to the king of Persia, that in the place where the priests that were led away, had hid the fire, there appeared water, with which Nehemias and they that were with him had purified the sacrifices.'
      v:034: '2MA:1:34 | 34 | 34 | And the king considering, and diligently examining the matter, made a temple for it, that he might prove what had happened.'
      v:035: '2MA:1:35 | 35 | 35 | And when he had proved it, he gave the priests many goods, and divers presents, and he took and distributed them to them with his own hand.'
      v:036: '2MA:1:36 | 36 | 36 | And Nehemias called this place Nephthar, which is interpreted purification. But many call it Nephi.'
  c:002:
    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '2MA:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>The descriptions.</i> That is, the records or memoirs of Jeremias, a work that is now lost. (Challoner) --- It was extant, the year before Christ 142. (Calmet) --- St. Ambrose (Of. iii. 14.) writes at large concerning this miracle. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - '2MA:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Of them.</i> He alludes to his epistle, (Calmet) Baruch vi. 11. (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - '2MA:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>And the ark.</i> These were not taken by the Chaldeans, Jeremias lii. (Menochius) --- Whether they were removed before or after the capture of the city, is disputed. (Salien, the year [of the world] 3446.) --- Besides the authority of this book, it is most probabe that Jeremias should have preserved them, as he was high in favour, Jeremias xxxix. 11. (Worthington) --- Hence most believe that Nabuzardan granted him leave. (Calmet) --- Eupolemus says Nabuchodonosor did this after he took the city. (Eusebius, præp. ix. 39.) --- Others think the prophet removed them under Joakim, having informed only a few of the priests. (N. Alex.) --- <i>Mountain;</i> Nebo, Deuteronomy xxxii. 49.'
      v:007:
        - '2MA:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Mercy.</i> Whether the ark, &c., were in the second temple, as this seems to insinuate, has been much debated. The negative seems best established and these promises refer to the Messias, prefigured by the ark. God wished to withdraw the Jews by degrees from their attachment to these sensible things, and to raise their minds to those of a more spiritual nature. (St. Ambrose) (Rupert, &c.) (Calmet, Diss.) --- Salien (the year [of the world] 3609) proves at large, that the ark was discovered at the same time as the sacred fire. (Menochius) --- Yet Josephus (Jewish Wars vi. 6.) testifies, that nothing was found in the holy of holies when the Romans took it. Hence others think that the ark will be produced to the Jews by Enoch and Elias. (Ribera, in Aggeus i.) (Tournemine) --- The first opinion gives most satisfaction. When Christ collected his disciples, he received testimony from the Father and from the Holy Ghost in a bright <i>cloud.</i> The figures of the law are at an end, and there will be no need of restoring them at the consummation of all things. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - '2MA:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Treated.</i> Greek, "He was manifested, and like one possessing wisdom, he," &c. (Haydock) --- On this occasion, Solomon chiefly displayed his wisdom, praying aloud.'
      v:010:
        - '2MA:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>As.</i> Both dedications lasted eight days, and fire descended, Leviticus ix. 23., and 2 Paralipomenon vii. 1.'
      v:011:
        - '2MA:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Consumed.</i> He alludes to what Moses said after the death of Nadab, Leviticus x. 16. (Calmet) --- Fire consumed the sin-offering as well as the rest.'
      v:013:
        - '2MA:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Set down.</i> Greek, "explained." --- <i>Books.</i> The Scriptures were not lost. (Menochius) --- Perhaps before this time no complete collection of them had been made. Esdras would point out and help to discover what had been written. (Calmet) --- The senate of the nation was also present. (Simon Crit. i. 1.) --- <i>David:</i> the psalms. All the other books may be designated under the name of <i>prophets.</i> (Haydock) --- <i>Kings;</i> Cyrus, &c., 1 Esdras vi. 3., &c. Josephus has inserted many such letters in his work. They were like the title-deeds of the nation. (Calmet) --- <i>And.</i> Greek, "regarding the presents;" {GREEK:START anathematon}αναθηματον{GREEK:END}. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - '2MA:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Judas.</i> This seems to be the Essene, who with others wrote this epistle; (chap. i. 10.; Worthington) or rather (Haydock) the Machabee, who was as solicitous to preserve the sacred books as Antiochus was to destroy them, 1 Machabees i. 59., and ii. 48. It is said that another assembly met to admit such books into the canon as had been written since the days of Nehemias.'
      v:015:
        - '2MA:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Things,</i> collected by Judas. The Bible had been translated into Greek before. But some records might still be wanted by the Jews in Egypt. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - '2MA:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>The purification.</i> This is the feast of the purifying or cleansing of the temple, (Challoner) the 25th of Casleu, chap. i. 9, 18.'
      v:018:
        - '2MA:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Place.</i> They had now liberty to return. What, therefore, can they mean but the coming of the Messias, who was shortly expected? (Calmet) --- Many Jews at this time were scattered in other countries, and did not chose to return, like those of Egypt. The people of Judea wish all would live together, as they had done under Solomon. (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - '2MA:2:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Place.</i> Read chap. xv. 38. After the author had written this appendix to the former book, he resolved to add an epitome of the history. Hence in this preface he informs us of the subject, method, reason, and diligence of his short work, ver. 20, 24, 5[25], 6[26], 9[29]. (Worthington) --- This piece is very elegant, and contains several rules for writing history. The author was a Jew as well as Jason, ver. 24.'
      v:022:
        - '2MA:2:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Manifestations:</i> heavenly apparitions, chap. iii. 25., and v. 2. (Calmet)'
      v:025:
        - '2MA:2:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Multitude.</i> Greek also, "confusion of numbers, and the difficulty attending those who wish to dive into {GREEK:START eiskukleisthan}ηισκυκληισθαν{GREEK:END}, (Haydock) or to include <i>much</i> (Calmet) historical relations on account of the quantity of matter." (Haydock)'
      v:027:
        - '2MA:2:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>No easy task,</i> &c. The spirit of God, that assists the sacred penman, does not exempt them from labour in seeking out the matter which they are to treat of, and the order and manner in which they are to deliver it. So St. Luke wrote the gospel, <i>having diligently attained to all things,</i> Luke i. 3. (Challoner) --- This evangelist had to inquire of others. (Worthington) --- Inspiration preserves from all danger of mistake. When something future is <i>revealed,</i> there is less difficulty, as God must then dictate the very words. Hence Jeremias wrote with the utmost ease, as Baruch testified, Jeremias xxxvi. 18, 32. (Haydock) --- The prophets had, therefore, only to write or speak from the mouth of God. Others were excited by him to treat of history, &c., and were preserved from error, but not from labour. (Bellarmine, Verb. i. 15.) --- In vain then do our adversaries attempt to prove that this book is not inspired. (Menochius)'
      v:028:
        - '2MA:2:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Others.</i> Greek, "have no easy task, so," &c. (Haydock) --- He alludes to the custom of choosing a master of the feast, who had to strive to give general satisfaction, Ecclesiasticus xxxii. 1., and Esther i. 8. (Calmet)'
      v:029:
        - '2MA:2:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Authors.</i> Greek, "the writer." (Haydock) --- Jason resembles an excellent painter, of whose work we desire to give a copy (Calmet) in miniature, (Haydock) relying entirely on his veracity. (Sa) --- Yet as the Church esteems this work to be canonical, what is extracted must be true, and inspired, though the writer seems not to have known that he had such a privilege. God might still guide his pen. (Menochius) --- The original might also be the work of a sacred writer, as many such appear to have been lost. If it were not, what is here selected cannot be questioned. St. Paul quotes some passages even from heathen poets, which in those cases were true, and thus became part of the word of God. (Haydock)'
      v:030:
        - '2MA:2:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Master.</i> Such is Jason. I only paint some parts. (Calmet) --- <i>Paint.</i> Greek, "to burn in and represent to the life, must," &c. (Haydock) --- The ancients painted the walls, preparing them by fire, &c. (Vitruvius vii. 5.; Josephus, Antiquities xvii. 12.) (Calmet)'
      v:032:
        - '2MA:2:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Nice.</i> Greek {GREEK:START exergastikon}ηξηργαστικον{GREEK:END}, "elaborate disquisitions." Both must equally seek the truth: but long details are not expected in abridgments as they are in a full history. (Haydock)'
      v:033:
        - '2MA:2:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Itself.</i> The account of Alexander [the Great] should be read next, 1 Machabees i. (Worthington)'

      v:001: '2MA:2:1 | 1 | 1 | Now it is found in the descriptions of Jeremias, the prophet, that he commanded them that went into captivity, to take the fire, as it hath been signified, and how he gave charge to them that were carried away into captivity.'
      v:002: '2MA:2:2 | 2 | 2 | And how he gave them the law, that they should not forget the commandments of the Lord, and that they should not err in their minds, seeing the idols of gold, and silver, and the ornaments of them.'
      v:003: '2MA:2:3 | 3 | 3 | And with other such like speeches, he exhorted them that they would not remove the law from their heart.'
      v:004: '2MA:2:4 | 4 | 4 | It was also contained in the same writing, how the prophet, being warned by God, commanded that the tabernacle and the ark should accompany him, till he came forth to the mountain {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}where Moses went up, and saw the inheritance of God.'
      v:005: '2MA:2:5 | 5 | 5 | And when Jeremias came thither he found a hollow cave: and he carried in thither the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense, and so stopped the door.'
      v:006: '2MA:2:6 | 6 | 6 | Then some of them that followed him, came up to mark the place: but they could not find it.'
      v:007: '2MA:2:7 | 7 | 7 | And when Jeremias perceived it, he blamed them, saying: The place shall be unknown, till God gather together the congregation of the people, and receive them to mercy.'
      v:008: '2MA:2:8 | 8 | 8 | And then the Lord will shew these things, and the majesty of the Lord shall appear, and there shall be a cloud as it was also shewed to Moses, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and he shewed it when Solomon prayed that the place might be sanctified to the great God.'
      v:009: '2MA:2:9 | 9 | 9 | For he treated wisdom in a magnificent manner: and like a wise man, he offered the sacrifice of the dedication, and of the finishing of the temple.'
      v:010: '2MA:2:10 | 10 | 10 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And as Moses prayed to the Lord, and fire came down from heaven, and consumed the holocaust: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 1}so Solomon also prayed, and fire came down from heaven and consumed the holocaust.'
      v:011: '2MA:2:11 | 11 | 11 | And Moses said: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Because the sin-offering was not eaten, it was consumed.'
      v:012: 2MA:2:12 | 12 | 12 | So Solomon also celebrated the dedication eight days.
      v:013: '2MA:2:13 | 13 | 13 | And these same things were set down in the memoirs, and commentaries of Nehemias: and how he made a library, and gathered together out of the countries, the books both of the prophets, and of David, and the epistles of the kings, and concerning the holy gifts.'
      v:014: '2MA:2:14 | 14 | 14 | And in like manner Judas also gathered together all such things as were lost by the war we had, and they are in our possession.'
      v:015: '2MA:2:15 | 15 | 15 | Wherefore, if you want these things, send some that may fetch them to you.'
      v:016: '2MA:2:16 | 16 | 16 | As we are then about to celebrate the purification, we have written unto you: and you shall do well, if you keep the same days.'
      v:017: '2MA:2:17 | 17 | 17 | And we hope that God, who hath delivered his people, and hath rendered to all the inheritance, and the kingdom, and the priesthood, and the sanctuary,'
      v:018: '2MA:2:18 | 18 | 18 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}As he promised in the law, will shortly have mercy upon us, and will gather us together from every land under heaven into the holy place.'
      v:019: '2MA:2:19 | 19 | 19 | For he hath delivered us out of great perils, and hath cleansed the place.'
      v:020: '2MA:2:20 | 20 | 20 | Now as concerning Judas Machabeus. and his brethren, and the purification of the great temple, and the dedication of the altar:'
      v:021: '2MA:2:21 | 21 | 21 | As also the wars against Antiochus, the illustrious, and his son, Eupator:'
      v:022: '2MA:2:22 | 22 | 22 | And the manifestations that came from heaven to them, that behaved themselves manfully on the behalf of the Jews, so that, being but a few they made themselves masters of the whole country, and put to flight the barbarous multitude:'
      v:023: '2MA:2:23 | 23 | 23 | And recovered again the most renowned temple in all the world, and delivered the city, and restored the laws that were abolished, the Lord with all clemency shewing mercy to them.'
      v:024: '2MA:2:24 | 24 | 24 | And all such things as have been comprised in five books by Jason, of Cyrene, we have attempted to abridge in one book.'
      v:025: '2MA:2:25 | 25 | 25 | For considering the multitude of books, and the difficulty that they find that desire to undertake the narrations of histories, because of the multitude of the matter,'
      v:026: '2MA:2:26 | 26 | 26 | We have taken care for those indeed that are willing to read, that it might be a pleasure of mind: and for the studious, that they may more easily commit to memory: and that all that read might receive profit.'
      v:027: '2MA:2:27 | 27 | 27 | And as to ourselves indeed, in undertaking this work of abridging, we have taken in hand no easy task; yea, rather a business full of watching and sweat.'
      v:028: '2MA:2:28 | 28 | 28 | But as they that prepare a feast, and seek to satisfy the will of others: for the sake of many, we willingly undergo the labour.'
      v:029: '2MA:2:29 | 29 | 29 | Leaving to the authors the exact handling of every particular, and as for ourselves, according to the plan proposed, studying to be brief.'
      v:030: '2MA:2:30 | 30 | 30 | For as the master builder of a new house must have care of the whole building: but he that taketh care to paint it, must seek out fit things for the adorning of it: so must it be judged for us.'
      v:031: '2MA:2:31 | 31 | 31 | For to collect all that is to be known, to put the discourse in order, and curiously to discuss every particular point, is the duty of the author of a history:'
      v:032: '2MA:2:32 | 32 | 32 | But to pursue brevity of speech, and to avoid nice declarations of things, is to be granted to him that maketh an abridgment.'
      v:033: '2MA:2:33 | 33 | 33 | Here then we will begin the narration: let this be enough by way of a preface: for it is a foolish thing to make a long prologue, and to be short in the story itself.'

      v:001: '2MA:3:1 | 1 | 1 | Therefore, when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and the laws as yet were very well kept, because of the godliness of Onias, the high priest, and the hatred his soul had of evil,'
      v:002: '2MA:3:2 | 2 | 2 | It came to pass that even the kings themselves, and the princes esteemed the place worthy of the highest honour, and glorified the temple with very great gifts:'
      v:003: '2MA:3:3 | 3 | 3 | So that Seleucus, king of Asia, allowed out of his revenues all the charges belonging to the ministry of the sacrifices.'
      v:004: '2MA:3:4 | 4 | 4 | But one Simon, of the tribe of Benjamin, who was appointed overseer of the temple, strove in opposition to the high priest, to bring about some unjust thing in the city.'
      v:005: '2MA:3:5 | 5 | 5 | And when he could not overcome Onias, he went to Apollonius, the son of Tharseas, who at that time was governor of Celosyria, and Phenicia:'
      v:006: "2MA:3:6 | 6 | 6 | And told him, that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of immense sums of money, and the common store was infinite, which did not belong to the account of the sacrifices: and that it was possible to bring all into the king's hands."
      v:007: '2MA:3:7 | 7 | 7 | Now when Apollonius had given the king notice concerning the money that he was told of, he called for Heliodorus, who had the charge over his affairs, and sent him with commission to bring him the foresaid money.'
      v:008: "2MA:3:8 | 8 | 8 | So Heliodorus forthwith began his journey, under a colour of visiting the cities of Celosyria and Phenicia, but indeed to fulfill the king's purpose."
      v:009: '2MA:3:9 | 9 | 9 | And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteously received in the city by the high priest, he told him what information had been given concerning the money: and declared the cause for which he was come: and asked if these things were so indeed.'
      v:010: '2MA:3:10 | 10 | 10 | Then the high priest told him that these were sums deposited, and provisions for the subsistence of the widows and the fatherless:'

      v:012: '2MA:3:12 | 12 | 12 | But that to deceive them who had trusted to the place and temple which is honoured throughout the whole world, for the reverence and holiness of it, was a thing which could not by any means be done.'

      v:016: '2MA:3:16 | 16 | 16 | Now whosoever saw the countenance of the high priest, was wounded in heart: for his face, and the changing of his colour, declared the inward sorrow of his mind.'
      v:017: '2MA:3:17 | 17 | 17 | For the man was so compassed with sadness and horror of the body, that it was manifest to them that beheld him, what sorrow he had in his heart.'
      v:018: '2MA:3:18 | 18 | 18 | Others also came flocking together out of their houses, praying and making public supplication, because the place was like to come into contempt.'
      v:019: '2MA:3:19 | 19 | 19 | And the women, girded with haircloth about their breasts, came together in the streets. And the virgins also that were shut up, came forth, some to Onias, and some to the walls, and others looked out of the windows.'
      v:020: '2MA:3:20 | 20 | 20 | And all holding up their hands towards heaven, made supplication.'
      v:021: '2MA:3:21 | 21 | 21 | For the expectation of the mixt multitude, and of the high priest, who was in an agony, would have moved any one to pity.'
      v:022: '2MA:3:22 | 22 | 22 | And these indeed called upon almighty God, to preserve the things that had been committed to them, safe and sure for those that had committed them.'
      v:023: '2MA:3:23 | 23 | 23 | But Heliodorus executed that which he had resolved on, himself being present in the same place with his guard about the treasury.'
      v:024: '2MA:3:24 | 24 | 24 | But the spirit of the Almighty God gave a great evidence of his presence, so that all that had presumed to obey him, falling down by the power of God, were struck with fainting and dread.'
      v:025: '2MA:3:25 | 25 | 25 | For there appeared to them a horse, with a terrible rider upon him, adorned with a very rich covering: and he ran fiercely and struck Heliodorus with his fore-feet, and he that sat upon him seemed to have armour of gold.'
      v:026: '2MA:3:26 | 26 | 26 | Moreover there appeared two other young men, beautiful and strong, bright and glorious, and in comely apparel: who stood by him, on either side, and scourged him without ceasing with many stripes.'
      v:027: '2MA:3:27 | 27 | 27 | And Heliodorus suddenly fell to the ground, and they took him up, covered with great darkness, and having put him into a litter they carried him out.'
      v:028: '2MA:3:28 | 28 | 28 | So he that came with many servants, and all his guard, into the aforesaid treasury, was carried out, no one being able to help him, the manifest power of God being known.'
      v:029: '2MA:3:29 | 29 | 29 | And he indeed, by the power of God, lay speechless, and without all hope of recovery.'
      v:030: '2MA:3:30 | 30 | 30 | But they praised the Lord because he had glorified his place: and the temple, that a little before was full of fear and trouble, when the Almighty Lord appeared, was filled with joy and gladness.'
      v:031: '2MA:3:31 | 31 | 31 | Then some of the friends of Heliodorus forthwith begged of Onias, that he would call upon the Most High to grant him his life, who was ready to give up the ghost.'
      v:032: '2MA:3:32 | 32 | 32 | So the high priest, considering that the king might perhaps suspect that some mischief had been done to Heliodorus by the Jews, offered a sacrifice of health for the recovery of the man.'
      v:033: '2MA:3:33 | 33 | 33 | And when the high priest was praying, the same young men in the same clothing stood by Heliodorus, and said to him: Give thanks to Onias the priest: because for his sake the Lord hath granted thee life.'
      v:034: '2MA:3:34 | 34 | 34 | And thou having been scourged by God, declare unto all men the great works and the power of God. And having spoken thus, they appeared no more.'
      v:035: '2MA:3:35 | 35 | 35 | So Heliodorus, after he had offered a sacrifice to God, and made great vows to him, that had granted him life, and given thanks to Onias, taking his troops with him, returned to the king.'
      v:036: '2MA:3:36 | 36 | 36 | And he testified to all men the works of the great God, which he had seen with his own eyes.'
      v:037: '2MA:3:37 | 37 | 37 | And when the king asked Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to be sent yet once more to Jerusalem, he said:'
      v:038: '2MA:3:38 | 38 | 38 | If thou hast any enemy or traitor to thy kingdom, send him thither, and thou shalt receive him again scourged, if so be he escape: for there is undoubtedly in that place a certain power of God.'
      v:039: '2MA:3:39 | 39 | 39 | For he that hath his dwelling in the heavens, is the visitor and protector of that place, and he striketh and destroyeth them that come to do evil to it.'
      v:040: '2MA:3:40 | 40 | 40 | And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of the treasury, fell out in this manner.'

      v:039: '2MA:4:39 | 39 | 39 | Now when many sacrileges had been committed by Lysimachus in the temple, by the counsel of Menelaus, and the rumour of it was spread abroad, the multitude gathered themselves together against Lysimachus, a great quantity of gold being already carried away.'
      v:040: '2MA:4:40 | 40 | 40 | Wherefore the multitude making an insurrection, and their minds being filled with anger, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and began to use violence, one Tyrannus being captain, a man far gone both in age and in madness.'
      v:041: '2MA:4:41 | 41 | 41 | But when they perceived the attempt of Lysimachus, some caught up stones, some strong clubs: and some threw ashes upon Lysimachus.'

      v:043: '2MA:4:43 | 43 | 43 | Now concerning these matters, an accusation was laid against Menelaus.'
      v:044: '2MA:4:44 | 44 | 44 | And when the king was come to Tyre, three men were sent from the ancients to plead the cause before him.'
      v:045: '2MA:4:45 | 45 | 45 | But Menelaus being convicted, promised Ptolemee to give him much money to persuade the king to favour him.'
      v:046: '2MA:4:46 | 46 | 46 | So Ptolemee went to the king in a certain court where he was, as it were to cool himself, and brought him to be of another mind:'
      v:047: '2MA:4:47 | 47 | 47 | So Menelaus, who was guilty of all the evil, was acquitted by him of the accusations: and those poor men, who, if they had pleaded their cause even before Scythians, should have been judged innocent, were condemned to death.'
      v:048: '2MA:4:48 | 48 | 48 | Thus they that prosecuted the cause for the city, and for the people, and the sacred vessels, did soon suffer unjust punishment.'

      v:015: '2MA:5:15 | 15 | 15 | But this was not enough; he presumed also to enter into the temple, the most holy in all the world, Menelaus, that traitor to the laws, and to his country, being his guide.'
      v:016: '2MA:5:16 | 16 | 16 | And taking in his wicked hands the holy vessels, which were given by other kings and cities, for the ornament and the glory of the place, he unworthily handled and profaned them.'
      v:017: '2MA:5:17 | 17 | 17 | Thus Antiochus going astray in mind, did not consider that God was angry for a while, because of the sins of the inhabitants of the city: and therefore this contempt had happened to the place:'
      v:018: '2MA:5:18 | 18 | 18 | Otherwise had they not been involved in many sins, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}as Heliodorus, who was sent by king Seleucus to rob the treasury, so this man also, as soon as he had come, had been forthwith scourged, and put back from his presumption.'
      v:019: "2MA:5:19 | 19 | 19 | But God did not choose the people for the place's sake, but the place for the people's sake."
      v:020: '2MA:5:20 | 20 | 20 | And therefore, the place also itself was made partaker of the evils of the people: but afterwards shall communicate in the good things thereof, and as it was forsaken in the wrath of  Almighty God, shall be exalted again with great glory, when the great Lord shall be reconciled.'
      v:021: '2MA:5:21 | 21 | 21 | So when Antiochus had taken away out of the temple a thousand and eight hundred talents, he went back in all haste to Antioch, thinking through pride, that he might now make the land navigable, and the sea passable on foot: such was the haughtiness of his mind.'
      v:022: '2MA:5:22 | 22 | 22 | He left also governors to afflict the people: at Jerusalem, Philip, a Phrygian by birth, but in manners more barbarous than he that set him there:'

      v:025: '2MA:5:25 | 25 | 25 | Who, when he was come to Jerusalem, pretending peace, rested till the holy day of the sabbath: and then the Jews keeping holiday, he commanded his men to take arms.'
      v:026: '2MA:5:26 | 26 | 26 | And he slew all that were come forth to see: and running through the city with armed men, he destroyed a very great multitude.'

Other nations made no resistance: but the Jews knew better. (Calmet) --- <i>Garizim;</i> viz., the temple of the Samaritans. And as they were originally strangers, the name of <i>Hospitalis</i> (which signifies <i>of</i> or <i>belonging to strangers</i>) was applicable to the idol set up in their temple. (Challoner) --- The Samaritans in time of danger, denied that they had any thing to do with the Jews, pretending to be of Sidonian extraction. They even requested that their temple might be dedicated to the Greek Jupiter. (Josephus, Antiquities xii. 7.) --- Yet Epiphanes chose "the Hospitaller." (Calmet) --- Sannaballat procured this temple to be erected in the days of Alexander; and Ananias built another in Egypt, under Philometor. Both were schismatical. (Josephus, Antiquities xi. 8., and xv. 6. (Worthington)'

(Calmet) --- Protestants, "to go in procession to Bacchus, carrying ivy." Ward (Err. p. 114) reads {GREEK:START pompaduein}πωπαδυηιν{GREEK:END}, and refers the reader to the lexicon to see if there be any thing in it like the Catholic processions, or whether it signify so much as "to go about," as other Protestant Bibles translate it. These interpreters frequently use Catholic terms, where they might render them odious. (Id.[Ward, Err. p. 114.?]) (Haydock)'

(Calmet) --- Yet we find others unnamed suffering before him, ver. 10. (Haydock) --- Eleazar was learned in the Scriptures, and in all divine and human knowledge. (Worthington)'

(Worthington) --- Greek, "They were set over that wicked feast <i>or</i> sacrifice," {GREEK:START splagchnismo}σπλαγχνισμο{GREEK:END}, (Haydock) in which the entrails were eaten. (Calmet) --- In this sense the term is used [in] ver. 7 and 8 by the Vulgate. Here <i>Pity</i> is preferred, as the man seemed to be actuated by it. (Haydock) --- This generous martyr would not scandalize the weak, by doing a thing in itself lawful, which would have been deemed a prevarication. He was guided by those excellent maxims which Christ, St. Paul, and St. Saba (Mart. Ap. xii.) have inculcated and practised, Matthew xviii. 7., and Romans xiv. 14., and 1 Corinthians viii. 4, 10.

(Worthington) --- Some holy doctors have declared that they would rather go to hell than commit a sin. (St. Anselm) --- They understand by hell the torments of that place, but not the opposition to God's will, which is found in the damned, and constitutes one of the greatest of their pains. (Haydock)"

      v:004: '2MA:6:4 | 4 | 4 | For the temple was full of the riot and revellings of the Gentiles: and of men lying with lewd women. And women thrust themselves of their accord into the holy places, and brought in things that were not lawful.'
      v:005: '2MA:6:5 | 5 | 5 | The altar also was filled with unlawful things, which were forbidden by the laws.'

        - '2MA:7:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Scourges,</i> made of leather thongs; <i>taureis.</i> (Haydock) --- These brethren are styled Machabees; as Judas rendered this name so famous, that all who suffered or fought valiantly for religion in those times, went by this appellation. Josephus has much embellished this history, and Erasmus still more. The tombs of these martyrs were shewn at Antioch. (Calmet) --- Their names are not known. (Haydock) --- Those who wish to see more, may consult the large discourse of Josephus on the Machabees, (Worthington) though this work be contested, and St. Cyprian iv. ep. 6; St. Ambrose i. of. 40.; St. Chrysostom; St. Augustine; St. Leo, &c.

(Josephus, &c.) --- The Church honoured these martyrs from the earliest ages, and before any other of the Old Testament. We may justly style them the martyrs of the resurrection, as none at that time had spoken of it so distinctly. Sts.

    verses:
      v:001: "2MA:7:1 | 1 | 1 | It {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}came to pass also, that seven brethren, together with their mother, were apprehended, and compelled by the king to eat swine's flesh against the law, for which end they were tormented with whips and scourges."
      v:002: '2MA:7:2 | 2 | 2 | But one of them, who was the eldest, said thus: What wouldst thou ask, or learn of us? we are ready to die, rather than to transgress the laws of God, received from our fathers.'
      v:003: '2MA:7:3 | 3 | 3 | Then the king being angry, commanded frying-pans, and brazen cauldrons to be made hot: which forthwith being heated,'
      v:004: '2MA:7:4 | 4 | 4 | He commanded to cut out the tongue of him that had spoken first: and the skin of his head being drawn off, to chop off also the extremities of his hands and feet, the rest of his brethren and his mother looking on.'
      v:005: '2MA:7:5 | 5 | 5 | And when he was now maimed in all parts, he commanded him, being yet alive, to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in the frying-pan: and while he was suffering therein long torments, the rest, together with the mother, exhorted one another to die manfully,'
      v:006: '2MA:7:6 | 6 | 6 | Saying: The Lord God will look upon the truth, and will take pleasure in us, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}as Moses declared in the profession of the canticle; And in his servants he will take pleasure.'
      v:007: '2MA:7:7 | 7 | 7 | So when the first was dead after this manner, they brought the next to make him a mocking-stock: and when they had pulled off the skin of his head with the hair, they asked him if he would eat, before he were punished throughout the whole body in every limb.'
      v:008: '2MA:7:8 | 8 | 8 | But he answered in his own language, and said: I will not do it. Wherefore he also, in the next place, received the torments of the first:'
      v:009: '2MA:7:9 | 9 | 9 | And when he was at the last gasp, he said thus: Thou indeed, O most wicked man, destroyest us out of this present life: but the King of the world will raise us up, who die for his laws, in the resurrection of eternal life.'
      v:010: '2MA:7:10 | 10 | 10 | After him the third was made a mocking-stock, and when he was required, he quickly put forth his tongue, and courageously stretched out his hands:'
      v:011: '2MA:7:11 | 11 | 11 | And said with confidence: These I have from heaven, but for the laws of God I now despise them, because I hope to receive them again from him.'
      v:012: "2MA:7:12 | 12 | 12 | So that the king, and they that were with him, wondered at the young man's courage, because he esteemed the torments as nothing."
      v:013: '2MA:7:13 | 13 | 13 | And after he was thus dead, they tormented the fourth in the like manner.'
      v:014: '2MA:7:14 | 14 | 14 | And when he was now ready to die, he spoke thus: It is better, being put to death by men, to look for hope from God, to be raised up again by him; for, as to thee, thou shalt have no resurrection unto life.'
      v:015: '2MA:7:15 | 15 | 15 | And when they had brought the fifth, they tormented him. But he, looking upon the king,'
      v:016: '2MA:7:16 | 16 | 16 | Said: Whereas thou hast power among men, though thou art corruptible, thou dost what thou wilt: but think not that our nation is forsaken by God.'
      v:017: '2MA:7:17 | 17 | 17 | But stay patiently a while, and thou shalt see his great power, in what manner he will torment thee and thy seed.'
      v:018: '2MA:7:18 | 18 | 18 | After him they brought the sixth, and he being ready to die, spoke thus: Be not deceived without cause: for we suffer these things for ourselves, having sinned against our God, and things worthy of admiration are done to us:'
      v:019: '2MA:7:19 | 19 | 19 | But do not think that thou shalt escape unpunished, for that thou attempted to fight against God.'
      v:020: '2MA:7:20 | 20 | 20 | Now the mother was to be admired above measure, and worthy to be remembered by good men, who beheld seven sons slain in the space of one day, and bore it with a good courage, for the hope that she had in God:'
      v:021: "2MA:7:21 | 21 | 21 | And she bravely exhorted every one of them in her own language, being filled with wisdom; and joining a man's heart to a woman's thought,"
      v:022: '2MA:7:22 | 22 | 22 | She said to them: I know not how you were formed in my womb; for I neither gave you breath, nor soul, nor life, neither did I frame the limbs of every one of you.'
      v:023: '2MA:7:23 | 23 | 23 | But the Creator of the world, that formed the nativity of man, and that found out the origin of all, he will restore to you again, in his mercy, both breath and life, as now you despise yourselves for the sake of his laws.'
      v:024: '2MA:7:24 | 24 | 24 | Now Antiochus, thinking himself despised, and withal despising the voice of the upbraider, when the youngest was yet alive, did not only exhort him by words, but also assured him with an oath, that he would make him a rich and a happy man, and, if he would turn from the laws of his fathers, would take him for a friend, and furnish him with things necessary.'
      v:025: '2MA:7:25 | 25 | 25 | But when the young man was not moved with these things, the king called the mother, and counselled her to deal with the young man to save his life.'
      v:026: '2MA:7:26 | 26 | 26 | And when he had exhorted her with many words, she promised that she would counsel her son.'
      v:027: '2MA:7:27 | 27 | 27 | So bending herself towards him, mocking the cruel tyrant, she said in her own language: My son, have pity upon me, that bore thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee suck three years, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age.'
      v:028: '2MA:7:28 | 28 | 28 | I beseech <i>thee</i>, my son, look upon heaven and earth, and all that is in them, and consider that God made them out of nothing, and mankind also:'
      v:029: '2MA:7:29 | 29 | 29 | So thou shalt not fear this tormentor, but being made a worthy partner with thy brethren, receive death, that in that mercy I may receive thee again with thy brethren.'
      v:030: '2MA:7:30 | 30 | 30 | While she was yet speaking these words, the young man said: For whom do you stay? I will not obey the commandment of the king, but the commandment of the law which was given us by Moses.'
      v:031: '2MA:7:31 | 31 | 31 | But thou that hast been the author of all mischief against the Hebrews, shalt not escape the hand of God.'
      v:032: 2MA:7:32 | 32 | 32 | For we suffer thus for our sins.
      v:033: '2MA:7:33 | 33 | 33 | And though the Lord, our God, is angry with us a little while, for our chastisement and correction, yet he will be reconciled again to his servants.'
      v:034: '2MA:7:34 | 34 | 34 | But thou, O wicked, and of all men most flagitious, be not lifted up without cause with vain hopes, whilst thou art raging against his servants.'
      v:035: '2MA:7:35 | 35 | 35 | For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of the Almighty God, who beholdeth all things.'
      v:036: '2MA:7:36 | 36 | 36 | For my brethren having now undergone a short pain, are under the covenant of eternal life: but thou, by the judgment of God, shalt receive just punishment for thy pride.'
      v:037: '2MA:7:37 | 37 | 37 | But I, like my brethren, offer up my life and my body for the laws of our fathers: calling upon God to be speedily merciful to our nation, and that thou by torments and stripes mayst confess that he alone is God.'
      v:038: '2MA:7:38 | 38 | 38 | But in me, and in my brethren, the wrath of the Almighty, which hath justly been brought upon all our nation, shall cease.'
      v:039: '2MA:7:39 | 39 | 39 | Then the king being incensed with anger, raged against him more cruelly than all the rest, taking it grievously that he was mocked.'
      v:040: '2MA:7:40 | 40 | 40 | So this man also died undefiled, wholly trusting in the Lord.'
      v:041: '2MA:7:41 | 41 | 41 | And last of all, after the sons, the mother also was consumed.'
      v:042: '2MA:7:42 | 42 | 42 | But now there is enough said of the sacrifices, and of the excessive cruelties.'

      v:001:
        - '2MA:8:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Towns.</i> Literally, "castles." Greek, "villages." It also means a town or village; and at this time, Judas chiefly dwelt in the deserts. (Haydock) --- Many particulars of this war are found [in] 1 Machabees iii. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 2MA:8:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Lord.</i> Prayer is particularly requisite before battle. (Worthington)
      v:003:
        - "2MA:8:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Blood</i> of the Jews unjustly slain. (Menochius) --- The voice of Abel's and of Christ's blood is very different, Genesis iv. 10., and Hebrews xii. 24."
      v:008:
        - '2MA:8:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Philip seeing,</i> &c. The governor of Jerusalem found himself unable to contend with Judas, especially after the victories he had obtained over Apollonius and Seron, 1 Machabees iii. (Challoner) --- He was left two years before (Calmet) to afflict the Jews. (Worthington)'
      v:009:
        - '2MA:8:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Twenty thousand.</i> The whole number of the forces sent at that time into Judea, was 40,000 footmen and 7,000 horsemen; (1 Machabees iii. 30.) but only 20,000 are here taken notice of, because there were no more with Nicanor at that time of the battle. (Challoner)'
      v:010:
        - '2MA:8:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Talents.</i> So much the king was in arrear, owing to his prodigality. For which reason he was gone beyond the Euphrates [River] to raise money. His father had to pay the Romans 15,000 talents in twelve years.'
      v:011:
        - '2MA:8:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Ninety.</i> Often (Calmet) a talent was paid for one slave. (Josephus, Antiquities xii. 4.)'
      v:013:
        - '2MA:8:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Justice.</i> Greek {GREEK:START diken}δικην{GREEK:END}, "vengeance" (Haydock) against the enemies. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - 2MA:8:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Covenant.</i> A just and religious cause is the best help in war. (Worthington)
      v:016:
        - '2MA:8:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Seven thousand.</i> In the Greek it is <i>six thousand.</i> But then three thousand of them had no arms, 1 Machabees iv. 6. (Challoner) --- If the army was divided into four companies of 1,500, there would be only 6,000. But if Judas had with him 3,000, it would consist of 7,500. (Calmet) --- <i>Reconciled.</i> Greek, "consternated at," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - '2MA:8:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Galatians.</i> That is, the Gauls, who having ravaged Italy and Greece, poured themselves in upon Asia in immense multitudes, where also they founded the kingdom of Galatia, or Gallo-Græcia. (Challoner) --- This battle is nowhere else recorded in Scripture. But it seems to allude to the aid given to Soter by the Jews, (Worthington) when he repulsed the Galatians. (Appian.) --- Antiochus the great rewarded them for their valour shewn in behalf of his father. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xii. 3.) (Worthington) --- <i>Six.</i> Greek, 8,000. --- <i>When.</i> Greek, "with 4,000 Macedonians; when the Macedonians being at a stand, the 6,000 (Grabe substitutes 8,000) slew twelve myriads," &c. (Haydock) --- Historians have not specified this irruption, as it had no farther consequences. The Galatians were very powerful under Antiochus the great, and sided with him. The consul, Manlius, made them promise to keep within their own territories. But they did not observe this agreement, since they attacked Eumenes while Epiphanes persecuted the Jews. It is not agreed when they made the invasion of Babylonia, then defended by Jewish and Macedonian troops under the king of Syria.'
      v:022:
        - '2MA:8:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Joseph;</i> perhaps the same with John Gaddis, or simply a relation.'
      v:023:
        - '2MA:8:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Esdras.</i> Greek and Syriac, "Eleazar;" probably the brother of Judas. Grotius thinks that the latter read the account of the death of Eleazar, which must be understood of the martyr, (chap. v.) as the brother of Judas was slain under Eupator. Perhaps the law regarding people going to fight was read; (Deuteronomy xx. 6., and 1 Machabees iii. 56.) or as Judas prepared for battle by prayer and fasting, some portions of Scripture might be selected while they were at Maspha. --- <i>Help.</i> So he specifies <i>the victory of God,</i> chap. xiii. 15. (Calmet)'
      v:024:
        - '2MA:8:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Above nine thousand,</i> viz., including the three thousand slain in the pursuit. (Challoner) --- Three thousand fell on the field of battle, 1 Machabees iv. 15.'
      v:026:
        - '2MA:8:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Time.</i> They wished to be in the camp before the sabbath, having designed to collect the <i>spoils.</i>'
      v:028:
        - '2MA:8:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Widows.</i> Judas follows the spirit rather than the letter of the law, Numbers xxxi. 27., and Deuteronomy xiv. 29.'
      v:030:
        - '2MA:8:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Timotheus.</i> Chap. x. 24. The particulars of this war are not given. It seems to have taken place after the temple was purified, ver. 31. We must distinguish this first war from another mentioned, chap. x. 24., and 1 Machabees v. 5. Judas defeated another Timotheus beyond the Jordan [River], chap. xii. 10., and 1 Machabees v. 11, 34, 37.'
      v:031:
        - '2MA:8:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Jerusalem.</i> They had taken all but the citadel, chap. x. 1.'
      v:035:
        - '2MA:8:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Apparel,</i> as a general. (Calmet) --- <i>Fleeing.</i> Greek, "like a fugitive, having rendered himself destitute, he came through the midland country to Antioch above all being fortunate himself in," &c. (Haydock) --- He was too happy in having escaped. The Roman edition and Syriac agree with us, "being very unhappy," &c., (Calmet) which is substituted by Grabe. (Haydock)'

      v:008: "2MA:8:8 | 8 | 8 | Then Philip seeing that the man gained ground by little and little, and that things for the most part succeeded prosperously with him, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}wrote to Ptolemee, the governor of Celosyria and Phenicia, to send aid to the king's affairs."
      v:009: '2MA:8:9 | 9 | 9 | And he with all speed sent Nicanor, the son of Patroclus, one of his special friends, giving him no fewer than twenty thousand armed men of different nations, to root out the whole race of the Jews, joining also with him Gorgias, a good soldier, and of great experience in matters of war.'
      v:010: '2MA:8:10 | 10 | 10 | And Nicanor purposed to raise for the king the tribute of two thousand talents, that was to be given to the Romans, by making so much money of the captive Jews:'
      v:011: '2MA:8:11 | 11 | 11 | Wherefore he sent immediately to the cities upon the sea coast, to invite men together to buy up the Jewish slaves, promising that they should have ninety slaves for one talent, not reflecting on the vengeance which was to follow him from the Almighty.'
      v:012: '2MA:8:12 | 12 | 12 | Now when Judas found that Nicanor was coming, he imparted to the Jews that were with him, that the enemy was at hand.'

(Aldus; Usher) --- They were convinced that some sins might be forgiven in the other world, particularly when the living interceded. (Calmet) --- The Jews began to pray for the dead after the captivity, (Grotius) when the prophets had more clearly explained what took place after death. (Calmet) --- Yet the doctrine and practice might still be as ancient as the world. (Haydock) --- If it had not prevailed before, Judas would never have entertained such sentiments. (Worthington) --- The Jews admit a sort of purgatory for "the prevaricators of Israel," which differs from hell only in duration. They assert that the damned of their nation are exempt from suffering on the sabbath. (Bartolocci; Leo v. 10.; Tirinus; Estius) --- Some Christians have supposed that the sin here specified was mortal, and the deceased in hell, yet prayer might be of service to them. Origen (Prin. iii. 6.) thought that even the devils would one day be liberated. St. Augustine (Ench. cx. 29.) says prayers "are of service, either that the remission may be entire, or surely that damnation itself may be more tolerable." Most understand this of purgatory: but several explain it of the damned. (Rrot. Bened.) --- A mass was formerly composed for this purpose, <i>tolerabilia fiant ipsa tormenta:</i> and some monks prayed for certain robbers slain, "that their pains might be diminished by the severe judge." (Aldrev. xxi) Excommunication might be taken off from the deceased. (St. Gregory, Dial. ii. 29.) --- Purgatory is for venial sins. (Ibid.[St. Gregory, Dial.] iv. 39.)

Sacrifices for the dead were not enjoined, but the practice was then established, and this author takes every opportunity of proving the resurrection against the Sadducees, who then began to appear. The Church of Christ has adopted the same practice. See Bellarmine, Serarius, &c. Our adversaries confess that such was the opinion of the Jews, and of the ancient doctors of the Church. But they declare it superstitious, and deny the authority of these books, which has been sufficiently established. Could such holy personages authorize superstition? Would Christ and his apostles have tolerated it? St. Paul prayed for Onesiphorus after his decease, 2 Timothy i. 16. See Matthew xii. 33., and Luke xvi. 9., and 1 Corinthians iii. 13., and xv. 29.; Eusebius, Life of Constantine iv.; St. Epiphanius, hær. lxxv.; St. Cyprian i. ep. 9.; Tertullian, &c. (Calmet)'
      v:045:
        - '2MA:12:45 | 45 | 45 | <i>With godliness.</i> Judas hoped that these men who died fighting for the cause of God and religion, might find mercy; either because they might be excused from mortal sin by ignorance, or might have repented of their sin at least at their death. (Challoner) --- Charity requires us to judge thus, when there are no positive proofs to the contrary. (Calmet) --- Pope John VIII answered the bishops of France, that those who died fighting against infidels were saved. (Mabil. T. iii. An. Ben.) --- Judas might entertain the like hopes, though they are not always well grounded. (Haydock)'
      v:046:
        - '2MA:12:46 | 46 | 46 | <i>Holy.</i> This text is so clear, that our adversaries judge it best to deny the book to be canonical. As that has been authentically proved, (Preface) we shall only add that the Greek version, though differing in many points, is here as express as the Vulgate, (Worthington) <b>45.</b> "considering that the best grace is laid up for those who sleep in piety. Holy and pious <i>is</i> the thought. (Haydock) Wherefore he made reconciliation (<i>or</i> expiation) for the dead, that they might be delivered from sin," or punishment due to it. (Worthington) --- Sin is often taken for the punishment; and this effect of mortal sin may be remitted in purgatory, when the person has sincerely repented in this life. (Haydock) --- To pass over other proofs, we will only mention St. Augustine (hær. liii.) and St. Bernard, (Cant. lxvi.) who plainly account those "heretics," who deny purgatory. It is also worthy of notice that Judas, who acted thus charitably, was the high priest and defender of the true faith; and that the Jews still pray for the dead, as the book <i>Mahzor,</i> published by Genebrard, 1569, evinces. There they say, "Let him rest in peace," and "ye angels of peace come forth to meet him." But this is acknowledged by Munster and Fagius, (in Deuteronomy xiv.) and by Whitaker. --- <i>Sins.</i> Go to 1 Machabees vi. 18. (Worthington)'

      v:003: '2MA:13:3 | 3 | 3 | Menelaus also joined himself with them: and with great deceitfulness besought Antiochus, not for the welfare of his country, but in hopes that he should be appointed chief ruler.'
      v:004: '2MA:13:4 | 4 | 4 | But the King of kings stirred up the mind of Antiochus against the sinner, and upon Lysias suggesting that he was the cause of all the evils, he commanded (as the custom is with them) that he should be apprehended and put to death in the same place.'

      v:011: '2MA:13:11 | 11 | 11 | Because they were afraid to be deprived of the law, and of their country, and of the holy temple: and that he would not suffer the people, that had of late taken breath for a little while, to be again in subjection to blasphemous nations.'
      v:012: '2MA:13:12 | 12 | 12 | So when they had all done this together, and had craved mercy of the Lord with weeping and fasting, lying prostrate on the ground for three days continually, Judas exhorted them to make themselves ready.'

      v:023: '2MA:13:23 | 23 | 23 | He fought with Judas: and was overcome. And when he understood that Philip, who had been left over the affairs, had rebelled at Antioch, he was in a consternation of mind, and entreating the Jews, and yielding to them, he swore to all things that seemed reasonable, and, being reconciled, offered sacrifice, honoured the temple, and left gifts.'
      v:024: '2MA:13:24 | 24 | 24 | He embraced Machabeus, and made him governor and prince from Ptolemais unto the Gerrenians.'
      v:025: '2MA:13:25 | 25 | 25 | But when he was come to Ptolemais, the men of that city were much displeased with the conditions of the peace, being angry for fear they should break the covenant.'
      v:026: "2MA:13:26 | 26 | 26 | Then Lysias went up to the judgment-seat, and set forth the reason, and appeased the people, and returned to Antioch: and thus matters went with regard to the king's coming and his return."

(Challoner) --- Whether he was thus inspired or not, we dare not decide. The Jews infer form the conduct of Samson, Saul, and Razias, that suicide is lawful when a person fears being overcome by torments, or giving occasion to other's blasphemy.

(Calmet) --- It was either not well done, or not to be imitated in this time of grace. (St. Augustine, ii. 23. contra ep. 2. Gaud.)

      v:012: '2MA:14:12 | 12 | 12 | And forthwith he sent Nicanor, the commander over the elephants, governor into Judea:'
      v:013: '2MA:14:13 | 13 | 13 | Giving him in charge, to take Judas himself: and disperse all them that were with him, and to make Alcimus the high priest of the great temple.'
      v:014: '2MA:14:14 | 14 | 14 | Then the Gentiles who had fled out of Judea, from Judas, came to Nicanor by flocks, thinking the miseries and calamities of the Jews to be the welfare of their affairs.'
      v:015: "2MA:14:15 | 15 | 15 | Now when the Jews heard of Nicanor's coming, and that the nations were assembled against them, they cast earth upon their heads, and made supplication to him who chose his people to keep them for ever, and who protected his portion by evident signs."

      v:017: '2MA:14:17 | 17 | 17 | Now Simon, the brother of Judas, had joined battle with Nicanor, but was frightened with the sudden coming of the adversaries.'

      v:019: '2MA:14:19 | 19 | 19 | Wherefore he sent Posidonius, and Theodotius, and Matthias before to present and receive the right hands.'
      v:020: '2MA:14:20 | 20 | 20 | And when there had been a consultation thereupon, and the captain had acquainted the multitude with it, they were all of one mind to consent to covenants.'
      v:021: '2MA:14:21 | 21 | 21 | So they appointed a day upon which they might commune together by themselves: and seats were brought out, and set for each one.'
      v:022: '2MA:14:22 | 22 | 22 | But Judas ordered armed men to be ready in convenient places, lest some mischief might be suddenly practised by the enemies: so they made an agreeable conference.'
      v:023: '2MA:14:23 | 23 | 23 | And Nicanor abode in Jerusalem, and did no wrong, but sent away the flocks of the multitudes that had been gathered together.'
      v:024: '2MA:14:24 | 24 | 24 | And Judas was always dear to him from the heart, and he was well affected to the man.'
      v:025: '2MA:14:25 | 25 | 25 | And he desired him to marry a wife, and to have children. So he married: he lived quietly, and they lived in common.'
      v:026: '2MA:14:26 | 26 | 26 | But Alcimus seeing the love they had one to another, and the covenants, came to Demetrius, and told him that Nicanor assented to the foreign interest, for that he meant to make Judas, who was a traitor to the kingdom, his successor.'
      v:027: "2MA:14:27 | 27 | 27 | Then the king, being in a rage, and provoked with this man's wicked accusations, wrote to Nicanor, signifying that he was greatly displeased with the covenant of friendship: and that he commanded him nevertheless to send Machabeus prisoner in all haste to Antioch."
      v:028: '2MA:14:28 | 28 | 28 | When this was known, Nicanor was in a consternation, and took it grievously that he should make void the articles that were agreed upon, having received no injury from the man.'
      v:029: '2MA:14:29 | 29 | 29 | But because he could not oppose the king, he watched an opportunity to comply with the orders.'
      v:030: '2MA:14:30 | 30 | 30 | But when Machabeus perceived that Nicanor was more stern to him, and that when they met together as usual he behaved himself in a rough manner; and was sensible that this rough behaviour came not of good, he gathered together a few of his men, and hid himself from Nicanor.'
      v:031: '2MA:14:31 | 31 | 31 | But he finding himself notably prevented by the man, came to the great and holy temple: and commanded the priests that were offering the accustomed sacrifices, to deliver him the man.'
      v:032: '2MA:14:32 | 32 | 32 | And when they swore unto him, that they knew not where the man was whom he sought, he stretched out his hand to the temple,'
      v:033: '2MA:14:33 | 33 | 33 | And swore, saying: Unless you deliver Judas prisoner to me, I will lay this temple of God even with the ground, and will beat down the altar, and I will dedicate this temple to Bacchus.'
      v:034: '2MA:14:34 | 34 | 34 | And when he had spoken thus, he departed. But the priests stretching forth their hands to heaven, called upon him that was ever the defender of their nation, saying in this manner:'
      v:035: '2MA:14:35 | 35 | 35 | Thou, O Lord of all things, who wantest nothing, wast pleased that the temple of thy habitation should be amongst us.'
      v:036: '2MA:14:36 | 36 | 36 | Therefore now, O Lord, the holy of all holies, keep this house for ever undefiled, which was lately cleansed.'
      v:037: '2MA:14:37 | 37 | 37 | Now Razias, one of the ancients of Jerusalem, was accused to Nicanor, a man that was a lover of the city, and of good report, who for his kindness was called the father of the Jews.'
      v:038: "2MA:14:38 | 38 | 38 | This man, for a long time, had held fast his purpose of keeping himself pure in the Jews' religion, and was ready to expose his body and life, that he might persevere therein."
      v:039: '2MA:14:39 | 39 | 39 | So Nicanor being willing to declare the hatred that he bore the Jews, sent five hundred soldiers to take him.'
      v:040: 2MA:14:40 | 40 | 40 | For he thought by ensnaring him to hurt the Jews very much.
      v:041: '2MA:14:41 | 41 | 41 | Now as the multitude sought to rush into his house, and to break open the door, and to set fire to it, when he was ready to be taken, he struck himself with his sword:'
      v:042: '2MA:14:42 | 42 | 42 | Choosing to die nobly rather than to fall into the hands of the wicked, and to suffer abuses unbecoming his noble birth.'
      v:043: '2MA:14:43 | 43 | 43 | But whereas through haste he missed of giving a sure wound, and the crowd was breaking into the doors, he ran boldly to the wall, and manfully threw himself down to the crowd:'
      v:044: '2MA:14:44 | 44 | 44 | But they quickly making room for his fall, he came upon the midst of the neck.'
      v:045: '2MA:14:45 | 45 | 45 | And as he had yet breath in him, being inflamed in mind, he arose: and while his blood ran down with a great stream, and he was grievously wounded, he ran through the crowd:'
      v:046: '2MA:14:46 | 46 | 46 | And standing upon a steep rock, when he was now almost without blood, grasping his bowels, with both hands he cast them upon the throng, calling upon the Lord of life and spirit, to restore these to him again: and so he departed this life.'

See St. Paul, 2 Corinthians xi. 6. (Challoner) --- The style was frequently left to their choice. (Haydock) --- Inspiration did not exclude natural acquirements. (Calmet) --- The author is not afraid of having said any thing erroneous, though he might be less polished, like St. Paul: <i>imperitus sermone sed non scientia.</i> But we, having now come to the end of the Old Testament, must crave pardon for any mistakes into which we may have fallen, in the execution of this work, which is dedicated to the English (Worthington) and to all his majesty's Catholic subjects, for whose benefit chiefly and for the sake of religion it has been undertaken. The <i>many things hard to be understood,</i> [2 Peter iii. 16.] which we did not wish to pass over, have swelled this work to a larger volume than was at first intended; larger, perhaps, than the purses of the poor and middle ranks, in the late hard times, could bear. But now the prospect is more cheering; and it is hoped that this profusion on a subject of such vast importance will be pardoned, particularly as we had also to comply with the desires of the more affluent, who repeatedly requested that the notes might be rather \"more ample.\" <i>As they that prepare a feast, and seek to satisfy the will of others,</i> so we, <i>for the sake of many, willingly undergo the labour,</i> chap. ii. 28. The variety of matter and of style may well be compared to a mixture of <i>wine</i> and <i>water,</i> ver. 40. Yet our aim has not been merely to please, but rather to counteract the baneful influences of heresy and infidelity. Thomas Paine (Age of Reason, part 2nd) having touched upon a few difficulties in some of the books of Scripture, says exultingly: \"I have gone through the Bible as a man would go through a wood, with an axe on his shoulders, and fell trees; here they lie, and the priests, if they can, may replant them. They may perhaps stick them in the ground, but they will never grow.\" Yes, they will grow, and brave the fury of tempests, because they have been planted not by priest, but by the hand of God. The Scriptures and the Church will stand and support each other till time shall be no more. The true faith has been preserved from Adam through all succeeding generations, and antichrist himself will not be able to destroy it. <i>My WORD shall not pass away,</i> [Mark xiii. 31.] says our divine Master. As we have repeatedly proved this assertion in the foregoing notes, which are already perhaps too copious, we shall refer the more inquisitive reader to the remarks of Dr. Worthington on the six ages, in the Douay Bible."

      v:020: '2MA:15:20 | 20 | 20 | And now when all expected what judgment would be given, and the enemies were at hand, and the army was set in array, the beasts and the horsemen ranged in convenient places,'
      v:021: '2MA:15:21 | 21 | 21 | Machabeus considering the coming of the multitude, and the divers preparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts, stretching out his hands to heaven, called upon the Lord, that worketh wonders, who giveth victory to them that are worthy, not according to the power of their arms, but according as it seemeth good to him.'
      v:022: '2MA:15:22 | 22 | 22 | And in his prayer he said after this manner: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Thou, O Lord, who didst send thy angel in the time of Ezechias, king of Juda, and didst kill a hundred and eighty-five thousand of the army of Sennacherib:'
      v:023: '2MA:15:23 | 23 | 23 | Send now also, O Lord of heaven, thy good angel before us, for the fear and dread of the greatness of thy arm,'
      v:024: '2MA:15:24 | 24 | 24 | That they may be afraid, who come with blasphemy against thy holy people. And thus he concluded his prayer.'
      v:025: '2MA:15:25 | 25 | 25 | But Nicanor, and they that were with him came forward, with trumpets and songs.'
      v:026: '2MA:15:26 | 26 | 26 | But Judas, and they that were with him, encountered them, calling upon God by prayers:'
      v:027: '2MA:15:27 | 27 | 27 | So fighting with their hands, but praying to the Lord with their hearts, they slew no less than five and thirty thousand, being greatly cheered with the presence of God.'
      v:028: '2MA:15:28 | 28 | 28 | And when the battle was over, and they were returning with joy, they understood that Nicanor was slain in his armour.'
      v:029: '2MA:15:29 | 29 | 29 | Then making a shout, and a great noise, they blessed the Almighty Lord in their own language.'
      v:030: "2MA:15:30 | 30 | 30 | And Judas, who was altogether ready, in body and mind, to die for his countrymen, commanded that Nicanor's head, and his hand, with the shoulder, should be cut off, and carried to Jerusalem."
      v:031: '2MA:15:31 | 31 | 31 | And when he was come thither, having called together his countrymen, and the priests to the altar, he sent also for them that were in the castle,'
      v:032: '2MA:15:32 | 32 | 32 | And shewing them the head of Nicanor, and the wicked hand, which he had stretched out, with proud boasts, against the holy house of the Almighty God,'
      v:033: '2MA:15:33 | 33 | 33 | He commanded also, that the tongue of the wicked Nicanor, should be cut out and given by pieces to birds, and the hand of the furious man to be hanged up over-against the temple.'
      v:034: '2MA:15:34 | 34 | 34 | Then all blessed the Lord of heaven, saying: Blessed be he that hath kept his own place undefiled.'
      v:035: "2MA:15:35 | 35 | 35 | And he hung up Nicanor's head in the top of the castle, that it might be an evident and manifest sign of the help of God."
      v:036: '2MA:15:36 | 36 | 36 | And they all ordained by a common decree, by no means to let this day pass without solemnity:'
      v:037: "2MA:15:37 | 37 | 37 | But to celebrate the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, called in the Syrian language, the day before Mardochias' day."
      v:038: '2MA:15:38 | 38 | 38 | So these things being done with relation to Nicanor, and from that time the city being possessed by the Hebrews, I also will here make an end of my narration.'
      v:039: '2MA:15:39 | 39 | 39 | Which if I have done well, and as it becometh the history, it is what I desired: but if not so perfectly, it must be pardoned me.'
      v:040: '2MA:15:40 | 40 | 40 | For as it is hurtful to drink always wine, or always water, but pleasant to use sometimes the one, and sometimes the other: so if the speech be always nicely framed, it will not be grateful to the readers. But here it shall be ended.'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - '<b>This</b> Second Book of Machabees is not a continuation of the history contained in the First; nor does it come down so low as the First does, but relates many of the same facts more at large, and adds other remarkable particulars, omitted in the First Book, relating to the state of the Jews as well before as under the persecution of Antiochus. The author, who is not the same with that of the First Book, has given (as we learn from chap. ii. 20., &c.) a short abstract of what Jason, of Cyrene, had written in the five volumes, concerning Judas and his brethren. He wrote in Greek, and begins with two letters, sent by the Jews of Jerusalem to their brethren in Egypt. (Challoner) --- Hence the whole book has been considered by some as an epistle. (Cotelier, Can. Ap. p. 338.) --- But it is easy to distinguish the letter from the history, (Calmet) to which a preface is prefixed, chap. ii. 20. Yet the Alexandrian copy has at the end, "A letter concerning the acts of Judas Mach.[Machabeus.]" (Haydock) --- The appendix of two epistles was added to the First Book by him who wrote the second, (Worthington) abridging the work of Jason. (Haydock)'
