    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'PRO:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Israel.</i> The dignity of the author, and the importance of the subject, invite us to read. (St. Basil) --- Solomon is the first whose name is placed at the head of any work in Scripture. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'PRO:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>To know.</i> This is the design of these parables. (Calmet) --- They tend to instruct both the unexperienced and the wise, ver. 5. There are three sorts of wisdom: the <i>divine,</i> which is God himself; (chap. iii. 16.) the <i>supernatural,</i> which is his gift, to lead us into all virtue; and the <i>worldly,</i> which is mixed with error, &c. (Worthington) (Wisdom vii. 25.)'
      v:004:
        - PRO:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Subtilty.</i> Discretion to the innocent. (Calmet)
      v:005:
        - 'PRO:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Wiser.</i> "Tamdiu audiendum & discendum est, quamdiu nescias, & si proverbio credimus, quamdiu vivas," says Seneca, ep. 77. --- <i>Governments.</i> And be fit to govern others, (Worthington) as well as himself. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'PRO:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Sayings.</i> This science was much esteemed, 3 Kings x. l., and Ecclesiasticus xxxix. 2.'
      v:007:
        - 'PRO:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Fear.</i> Thus we arrive at charity. (St. Augustine, in ep. Jo. ix.; Job xxviii. 28., &c.) This fear includes religion, but not barren speculations. (Calmet) --- It implies a desire to act, and not simply to understand.'
      v:008:
        - 'PRO:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Mother.</i> The first precept is to learn of our elders, and the second to resist evil counsels, ver. 10. (Worthington) --- Our parents have the greatest influence over us. Solomon presupposes that they are virtuous and well informed. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - 'PRO:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Entice.</i> Hebrew, "deceive." (Calmet) --- <i>Pessimum inimicorum genus laudantes.</i> (Tacitus, in vit. Agric.)'
      v:012:
        - 'PRO:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Pit.</i> Grave, or hell, like Dathan, Numbers xvi. This shews the greatest rage, Job xxxi. 31.'
      v:017:
        - 'PRO:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Wings.</i> If thou attend, therefore, to my instructions, their arts will be vain. (Ven. Bede) --- They unjustly seek to deceive the pious. (Calmet) --- Watchfulness will be the best protection against them. (Worthington)'
      v:019:
        - "PRO:1:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Possessors.</i> Of money. (Calmet) --- While they attempt to invade another's property, they ruin themselves, and come to the gallows. (Haydock)"
      v:020:
        - 'PRO:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Streets.</i> In every place we may learn wisdom. "The wise learn more from fools, than fools do from the wise," as Cato well observed. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - 'PRO:1:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Fools.</i> Hebrew, "and scorners delight in their scorning." (Protestants) --- Such are the pests of society. (Haydock) --- They turn piety to ridicule, and will talk about things which they do not understand, like our <i>esprits forts,</i> (Calmet) or pretended philosophers. (Haydock)'
      v:026:
        - 'PRO:1:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Mock.</i> God is too much above us to act thus; but he will treat us as an enraged enemy. (Calmet) --- In hell, the damned will cry in vain, ver. 28. They had sufficient graces offered while they were alive. (Worthington)'
      v:028:
        - 'PRO:1:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Find me.</i> Because their repentance was false, like that of Antiochus, 2 Machabees ix. 13., and Psalm xi. 4. (Calmet)'
      v:030:
        - 'PRO:1:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Despised.</i> Literally, "detracted," (Haydock) supposing my threats would not be put in execution. Hebrew, "they abhorred." (Calmet)'
      v:032:
        - 'PRO:1:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Turning.</i> Hebrew, "the ease of the simple," who have given way to deceit. (Calmet) --- <i>Them.</i> The objects of their eager desires, prove their ruin, Ezechiel xvi. 49.'
      v:033:
        - 'PRO:1:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Evils.</i> Both the just and the wicked, (ver. 31.; Haydock) shall be treated according to their deserts, 2 Corinthians v. 10. (Worthington) --- Even in this world, the just enjoy the peace of a good conscience. (Menochius)'

      v:006: 'PRO:1:6 | 6 | 6 | He shall understand a parable, and the interpretation, the words of the wise, and their mysterious sayings.'
      v:007: 'PRO:1:7 | 7 | 7 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.'

      v:017: PRO:1:17 | 17 | 17 | But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have wings.

      v:022: 'PRO:1:22 | 22 | 22 | O children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet those things which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise hate knowledge?'
      v:023: 'PRO:1:23 | 23 | 23 | Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will utter my spirit to you, and will shew you my words.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'PRO:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>If.</i> This proves free will. To become truly wise, we must desire it with the same avidity as a miser seeks for riches. (Worthington) --- We must also pray, (ver. 3.) with humility (ver. 2.) to God, the giver of wisdom, ver. 6. Every science which has not Him for the beginning and end, is vain and dangerous. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'PRO:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Salvation.</i> Protestants, "sound wisdom." <i>Tushiya</i> (Haydock) often occurs in this book, and is very comprehensive, (Calmet) denoting the substance (Haydock) of goodness, virtue, &c., Job v. 12.'
      v:008:
        - 'PRO:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Justice.</i> In his servants. (Calmet) --- God gives them grace to follow virtue, (Haydock) and protects them from every danger. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'PRO:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Things.</i> The danger of such company for young people is very great, as the heart is misled by the understanding, (Calmet) if it do not itself shew the way to error. (Haydock) --- We all possess a fund of corruption. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - PRO:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Evil.</i> These signs prove whom we ought to shun. St. Augustine depicts his own conduct before his conversion in the darkest colours. (Calmet)
      v:016:
        - 'PRO:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Strange.</i> Idolatress, (Grotius) or rather the abandoned woman, whether married or not. (Calmet) --- This description, as well as the former, guards us against heretics, who leave <i>the right way</i> of the Catholic Church, (ver. 13.) and devise <i>perverse</i> doctrines of rebellion against princes, &c., as if faith alone were sufficient. By this faith, Protestants do not mean any article which all must believe, but only that each one must be convinced that he himself is just, and will be saved. Like the strange woman, they preach a comfortable doctrine, and use sweet speeches, Romans xvi. 18. Their conversion is a very difficult matter, (ver. 19.) because they are condemned by their own judgment, (Titus iii. 11.) and will not admit of the ordinary means of instruction in the Church. (Worthington)'
      v:017:
        - 'PRO:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Youth.</i> Her husband, whom she married young when love is more lasting. This increases her guilt. It may also signify her father, or preceptor.'
      v:018:
        - 'PRO:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>God.</i> The law forbids adultery, and all impurities, Deuteronomy xxiii. 17., and Leviticus xx. 10. Both the parties, guilty of adultery, were punished with <i>death.</i> (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - 'PRO:2:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Life.</i> A sincere conversion is so rare among people once addicted to impurity, (Haydock) which resembles a deep pit. (Calmet) --- This illness is hardly removed. (Menochius)'
      v:021:
        - PRO:2:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Earth.</i> Happily. This was the wish of the carnal Jews. But the more enlightened raise their thoughts to heaven.

      v:004:
        - 'PRO:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Good.</i> Septuagint, "forecast good before the Lord and men." St. Paul seems to allude to this version, Romans xii. 17., and 2 Corinthians viii. 22. (Haydock)'

(Challoner) --- Hebrew, "they will not despise a thief, when he hath stolen to fill his soul, when he is hunger." (Mont.[Montanus?]) (Haydock) --- This was commonly supposed to be his motive, and he was only condemned to make restitution, without any further disgrace, chap. xix. 24., and Exodus xxii. 1. But what necessity could the adulterer plead? Both he and the woman must suffer death, Leviticus xx. 10.'

(St. Gregory, Mor. xxxiii. 15.) --- Here we may receive <i>all</i> instruction, the seven sacraments, and the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Pleasure had mentioned her attractions: now those of true wisdom are set before us. (Calmet) --- God sent his pastors at all times, to invite people to embrace the latter. They are all included in the number <i>seven,</i> both before and under the law, as well as in the gospel, where St. Paul styles Sts. Peter, James, and John, <i>pillars,</i> Galatians ii. This is the literal sense, on which the mystical is grounded, and both are intended by the Holy Ghost, intimating that the uncreated wisdom took flesh of the blessed Virgin Mary, prepared the table of bread and wine, as Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, and chose the weak of this world to confound the strong, as St. Augustine explains this passage.

These victims are contrasted with those of pleasure, chap. vii. 14. --- <i>Mingled.</i> It was not customary for any but barbarians and the gods to take pure wine. Some mixed two, others three, five, or even twenty parts of water. But the scholiast of Aristophanes says, the best method was to have three parts of water, and two of wine. Mercury complains that his wine was half water. (Arist. Plut. v. Sun. i.) --- The Fathers often apply this text to the feast of Jesus Christ in the blessed Eucharist.

Thus the latter hemistic generally illustrates the first. But here, part of ver. 8. may be improperly inserted.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "PRO:16:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>It is the part of man,</i> &c. That is, a man should prepare in his heart and soul what he is to say; but after all, it must be the Lord that must govern his tongue, to speak to the purpose. Not that we can think any thing of good without God's grace: but after that we have (with God's grace) thought and prepared within our souls what we would speak; if God does not govern our tongue, we shall not succeed in what we speak. (Challoner) --- He will put into our mouths what we have to say to persecutors, Luke xxi. 14. He often causes us to utter the reverse of what we intended, as Balaam did, Numbers xxiii. (Menochius) --- The fairest prospects miscarry without God's blessing. The enemies of grace would infer from this text, that the beginning of salvation depends on free-will. But St. Augustine (con. 2. epist. Pelag. ii. 8.) has solidly refuted them, and Solomon does not mean that man acts alone, chap. viii. 35., (Septuagint) John xv. 5., and 2 Corinthians iii. 5. \"Man,\" says St. Augustine, \"does no good things, which God does not cause him to perform.\" (Calmet) --- The Scripture cannot contradict itself. A fresh grace is requisite to execute what God has enabled us to devise, ver. 9. (Worthington)"
      v:002:
        - 'PRO:16:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Open.</i> Or approved. (Menochius) --- Hebrew, "pure in his own eyes." He sees not his own defects, chap. xxi. 2., and Job xxviii. 23. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - "PRO:16:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Open.</i> Hebrew, \"roll on,\" and refer all to God's glory. (Menochius) (Psalm xxxvi. 5.)"
      v:004:
        - 'PRO:16:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Day.</i> His obduracy is of his own choice, and must serve to set the divine justice in the clearest light, Ecclesiasticus xxxiii. 14., and Exodus ix. 16. Others hence infer that predestination is gratuitous, and reprobation in consequence of sin. It seems rather that temporal goods and evils are here meant. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'PRO:16:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Hand.</i> And he seems to be very quiet, chap. xi. 21. Septuagint, "but he who putteth his hand in hands unjustly, <i>to make a contract,</i> is," &c. --- <i>The,</i> &c., is taken from the Roman Septuagint and occurs before, chap. xv. 27.'

        - 'PRO:16:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Peace.</i> Thus Jacob, Joseph, Daniel, &c., were admired by their former enemies.'
      v:010:
        - 'PRO:16:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Judgment.</i> Or "let it not err," as people look upon the decisions of kings as so many oracles. We ought to act in this manner, as long as they are not visibly unjust. God gave a <i>principal spirit</i> (Psalm l. 14.) to Saul, David, Solomon, and to the judges whom he appointed, 1 Kings x. 9., Deuteronomy xxxiv. 9., and Judges iii. 10. (Calmet) --- Solomon was thus enabled to decide difficult cases. (Menochius) (Job xxix. 7.)'
      v:011:
        - "PRO:16:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Bag.</i> Many read <i>sæculi,</i> \"of the world.\" So Ven. Bede, &c. All God's appointments are perfectly just, chap. xi. 21. It was the custom for people to carry balances to weigh money, before it was coined. (Calmet)"
      v:013:
        - 'PRO:16:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Loved.</i> Yet none are more exposed to flattery and deceit than kings. (Seneca, ep. xxi.)'
      v:015:
        - PRO:16:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Life.</i> A mild government resembles a serene sky. (Sen.) (Clem.) (Job xxix. 23.)

      v:018:

      v:021:
        - 'PRO:16:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Shall.</i> Hebrew, "adds learning," both to himself and to others. Those who are wise and eloquent, must be preferred before those who have only the former qualification. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - 'PRO:16:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Heart.</i> Or knowledge. (Haydock) --- Wisdom gives beauty to eloquence.'
      v:026:
        - 'PRO:16:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Mouth.</i> The want of food, Ecclesiastes vi. 7.'

      v:028:
        - 'PRO:16:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Words.</i> Protestants, "a whisperer separateth chief friends."'
      v:030:
        - PRO:16:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Lips.</i> These motions indicate fury and pensiveness.
      v:031:
        - PRO:16:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Justice.</i> To the just longevity is promised. (Calmet)
      v:032:
        - 'PRO:16:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Valiant.</i> Alexandrian Septuagint adds, "and a prudent man than a great farmer." {GREEK:START Georgiou.}Γηοργιου.{GREEK:END} (Haydock) --- <i>Cities.</i> To govern the passions is more difficult. (St. Gregory, Past. iii. p. Adm. x.; St. Thomas Aquinas ii. 2. q. 128. a. 6.){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Latius regnes avidum domando</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Spiritum, quam si Lybiam,</i> &c. (Horace, ii. Od. 2.)'
      v:033:
        - 'PRO:16:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Lord.</i> So the apostles had recourse to them, (Acts i. 26.) as the Cophts[Copts?] and Nestorians still do when there is a dispute about the election of a patriarch. (Renaudot iv. Perpet. i. 7. and 9.) --- This mode may settle disputes, chap. xviii. 18. But we must not have recourse to it, except where the Church permits, lest we become the dupes of an idle curiosity. (Calmet) --- Nothing happens by chance. (St. Augustine, City of God v. 9.) --- Septuagint, "all things come into the breast of the unjust; but all just things proceed from the Lord." (Haydock)'

(Retractions i. 19.) --- The Hebrews, Athenians, and Romans, followed the same practice with adulteresses. (Selden, Ux. iii. 16.; Dem. in Neæram, &c.) --- Hermas (past. i. 4.) prescribes that the penitent shall be received again, but not often. In case of divorce, the fathers still permit not a second marriage, that the parties may be reconciled. They enjoin the husband to put away only such as are incorrigible.

        - 'PRO:19:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Rich,</i> is not in Hebrew, Septuagint, Complutensian, or St. Jerome. (Calmet) --- But as there is no antithesis between a poor man and a fool, it ought to be inserted, as it is in the Syriac, which reads, "than he who is perverse in his ways, though he be rich."

(Calmet) --- The former word intimates that the words have <i>no</i> solidity, and the latter that they shall be <i>his</i> only portion who is so foolish as to trust in them. <i>Sequens dicta non ispa;</i> (Montanus) or <i>ei ipsa,</i> if we follow the margin. (Haydock)'

        - 'PRO:19:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Killing.</i> Protestants, "crying;" or by his complaint be not deterred. (Haydock) --- Chaldean agrees with us. The law permitted parents to sell their children, and to have them stoned to death, if they declared them disobedient, (Deuteronomy xxi. 18.; Calmet) and riotous, ver. 20. Timely chastisement may prevent such extremities. (Haydock) --- St. Paul dissuades unnecessary severity, Colossians iii. 21.'

Septuagint, "a son who neglects to keep the instruction of his father, shall muse on bad sayings." (Haydock)'

(Calmet) (Josephus, contra Apion 2.) --- St. Ambrose says of his brother Satyrus, "though we had all things in common, yet the secret of our friends was not so."'
      v:010:
        - 'PRO:25:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Grace,</i> &c., is no in Hebrew, Complutensian, St. Jerome, &c. But it is in the Septuagint, "favour and friendship may give liberty; which keep thou for thyself, that thou mayst not be exposed to great shame. But guard thy ways unchangeably."

The Scriptures have a double sense. The exterior one leads to that sense which is interior, and more excellent. (Maimonides) (Parkhurst, p. 366.) --- <i>Gold,</i> oranges. --- <i>Beds.</i> On such the kings of Parthia slept, and these metals were very common under Solomon, 3 Kings x. 27., and Esther i. 6. (Calmet) --- Montanus renders <i>mascioth</i> "transparent cases." Protestants, "<i>pictures</i> of silver."'
      v:012:
        - 'PRO:25:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Bright.</i> Hebrew <i>chali cathem,</i> "an ornament of fine gold," (Montanus; Protestants; Haydock) may probably denote a collar or ring. The eastern nations wore rings fixed at the top of the ears, and under the nose. Some were so large that they put their meat through them. The Scripture often alludes to these customs, which are so different from ours. (Canticle of Canticles vii. 1.)'
      v:013:
        - 'PRO:25:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Harvest.</i> In June and July, when the heat was most intense, people of quality had snow from Libanus to mix with what they drank, Jeremias xviii. 14. (Calmet)'

(Haydock) --- The former sentence may be joined with the preceding, as it is improper to deprive a person of his garment, no less than to trust in the faithless; though some would suppose (Calmet) that this conduct, as well as the mixing of vinegar with nitre, is no less absurd than to attempt to relieve by music those who are extremely afflicted, Ecclesiasticus xxii. 6. (Tirinus) --- But Solomon does not speak of such, but only of those who are "heavy;" and we know that music has wonderful efficacy in relieving them, (1 Kings xvi. 17.) in like manner as this mixture serves to cleanse the skin and garments, (Jeremias ii. 22.; Calmet) and to purify the ears, when they are deafish. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxi. 10.; Vales. lx.) --- <i>As a,</i> &c., is not in Hebrew, St. Jerome, &c. (Calmet) --- The Chaldean has the latter part, (Haydock) "grief tries the heart, as fire does silver. As the worm eats wood, so folly," &c. (Calmet)'

The countries north of Palestine were not calculated to produce vapours and rain, which came rather from the south.

        - 'PRO:25:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Tidings.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint. The Vulgate seems rather to speak of a "good messenger." Homer said that a good messenger honoured the business most. (Pindar, Pyth. viii.) (Calmet)'

      v:027:
        - 'PRO:25:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Majesty,</i> viz., of God. For to search into that incomprehensible <i>Majesty,</i> and to pretend to sound the depths of the wisdom of God, is exposing our weak understanding to be blinded with an excess of light and glory, which it cannot comprehend. (Challoner) --- When the Church proposes to us any mystery, we have only to believe. Hebrew, "but it is glorious to sound their glory," and see where the wicked end, that we may not envy them, chap. iii. 31., and Psalm xxxvi. 7. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "so <i>for men</i> to search their own glory, <i>is not</i> glory," but a sin. (Haydock) --- "It is not good to eat too much honey," (Chaldean) or to sound the glorious words of God and wisdom, or the mysteries of religion. Septuagint, "But it is right to reverence glorious speeches," (Calmet) with esteem and humility. (Cat. Græc.)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'PRO:26:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Glory</i> and power. A fool in a high office will endanger himself and the public; (Calmet) while the virtuous, seeing that merit is not regarded, will not push themselves forward. (Æschines.)'
      v:002:
        - 'PRO:26:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>As a bird,</i> &c. The meaning is, that a curse uttered without cause shall do no harm to the person that is cursed, but will return upon him that curseth; as whithersoever a bird flies, it returns to its own nest. (Challoner) --- <i>Come.</i> Chaldean, "shall not come in vain," if it be just, like that of Noe, Josue, &c. Hebrew, "shall not come" (Calmet) to the person against whom it is uttered, though God will not hold the curser guiltless, as the Vulgate intimates. (Haydock) Curses, anathemas, &c., vented without reason, do not injure any but those who denounce them. Yet out of respect for ecclesiastical authority, those who are under censures, must abstain from their functions till they be absolved. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'PRO:26:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Snaffle.</i> "Bit," or muzzle, (<i>camus</i>) to prevent the animal from biting. (Haydock) --- Septuagint, Arabic, &c., "a goad for an ass." But <i>metheg</i> denotes a bridle. (Montanus; Haydock) asses being there very large, and commonly used for riding, chap. xiii. 13. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - 'PRO:26:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Answer not a fool,</i> &c. Viz., so as to imitate him; but only so as to reprove his folly. (Challoner) --- If thou answer at all, (ver. 5.) do it to the purpose, and to prevent others from taking scandal, (Calmet) as well as to humble the wicked, for his good. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - 'PRO:26:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Iniquity.</i> He is exposed to shame, (Septuagint) and must condemn his own folly. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'PRO:26:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Fair.</i> Hebrew, "unequal legs," <i>or</i> "lifted up," so, &c. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'PRO:26:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Mercury.</i> The god of travellers, who were wont to throw a stone at the foot of his statue, as the Indians (Vincent. Bellor. xxiv.) and Arabs did. Mahomet would not disturb this superstitious custom. The Rabbins style these statues Mercolis. But Septuagint, &c., give another sense, "as he that bindeth a stone (Calmet) in the boss of a ring, {GREEK:START sphendone}σφηνδονη{GREEK:END}, (Menochius) or in a sling," can do no good, but only endanger himself or others, "so," &c. Yet <i>margema</i> is never used elsewhere for a sling, and it means undoubtedly "a heap of stones," (Calmet) as Montanus substitutes instead of "the sling," in Pagnin. "As a small piece of precious stone in a heap of stones <i>is lost,</i> so," &c. (Pole. Syn. Parkhurst in <i>rogom.</i>) (Haydock) --- <i>Honour,</i> or an office, in which he may do harm. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - 'PRO:26:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>If.</i> Hebrew, "<i>as</i> a thorn goeth up into the," &c. (Protestants) (Haydock) --- If he attempt to handle or to extract one, he will wound himself the more, as the fool would render truth and wisdom contemptible. (Calmet) --- <i>Parable.</i> Septuagint, "but slavery in the hands of fools" groweth up. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - 'PRO:26:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Anger,</i> and prevent lawsuits. Hebrew is variously read and translated. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "the great <i>God,</i> that formed all things, both rewardeth the fool and rewardeth the transgressors." Marginal note, "a great man giveth all, and he hireth the fool," &c. Septuagint, "all the flesh of fools is exposed to many storms, for their excess is punished." (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'PRO:26:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Dog.</i> This is the only animal which is known to do so. St. Peter uses this comparison to deter any from renouncing the faith; as the Fathers do, to shew the misery attending a relapse. Septuagint here add, "there is a confusion," &c., taken from Ecclesiasticus iv. 25. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'PRO:26:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Fool.</i> The ignorant may be convinced that he wants instruction. (Calmet) --- But "none are worse than the half-learned." (Quintil. i. Jo. v. 21.)'
      v:014:
        - 'PRO:26:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Bed,</i> which he will scarcely leave, though avarice push him forward. (St. Augustine, ser. xxii. or clxiv.)'
      v:016:
        - 'PRO:26:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Seven,</i> or many wise men, who used to speak in a sententious manner. (Calmet) --- So seven is used, ver. 25.'
      v:017:
        - 'PRO:26:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Anger.</i> Hebrew, "passeth by, <i>and</i> meddleth with a quarrel not to him" pertaining. (Haydock) --- Such expose themselves foolishly to danger. Great discretion is requisite to reconcile those at variance.'
      v:019:
        - 'PRO:26:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Jest.</i> He will not escape, no more than the person who had committed murder involuntarily, if he were not in a city of refuge, Numbers xxxv. 22.'
      v:020:
        - 'PRO:26:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Faileth.</i> Hebrew, Symmachus, Calmet, "aboundeth, the fire is bright, <i>or</i> flourisheth" (Septuagint) (Haydock)'
      v:023:

(Challoner) --- <i>Vomiter</i> may denote David, who delivered many excellent canticles; <i>Eructavit cor,</i> Psalm xliv. De Dieu translates, "The words of him who is recollected the son of obedience." The author styles himself foolish, and asks for neither beggary nor riches, (ver. 2, 8.) which seems not to agree with Solomon; though there can be no doubt but this chapter is inspired. (Calmet) --- In effect, that great king might form this petition, being mindful of the instability of human greatness, and confess that of himself he was foolish. --- <i>Vision.</i> Hebrew <i>massa</i> (Haydock) generally implies something disagreeable, but here it is put for a collection of moral sentences. --- <i>With,</i> &c. Hebrew also, "to Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal," (Protestants; Haydock) friends of Agur, (Calmet) or his children, (Menochius) or rather Solomon speaks to all the faithful. We never find Agur mentioned as a canonical writer; and if he were, he would have been placed after Solomon. (Worthington)'

See Jeremias xxxi. 22.; Univ. Hist. iii. p. 144, note. Isaiah vii. 14.; Parkhurst in <i>alm.</i> (Haydock) --- Some of the Jews have admitted this explanation. (Cornelius a Lapide) --- Others understand that the marks of virginity are equivocal; (Bossuet, &c.) or, if we stick to the Vulgate and Septuagint, the difference betwixt a child and a young man is extremely great, and almost incomprehensible. (Calmet) --- Young people who follow their carnal appetite, can no more give an account of their actions than of the course of an eagle, &c. (Worthington) --- His wanderings are manifold.

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "This book is so called, because it consists of wise and weighty sentences, regulating the morals of men; and directing them to wisdom and virtue. And these sentences are also called <b>Parables,</b> because great truths are often couched in them under certain figures and similitudes. (Challoner) --- Wisdom is introduced speaking in the nine first chapters. Then to chap. xxv. more particular precepts are given. (Worthington) --- Ezechias caused to be collected (Haydock) what comes in the five next chapters, and in the two last. Some other, or rather Solomon himself, under (Worthington) different titles, gives us Agur's and his mother's instructions, and his own commendations of a valiant woman, (Haydock) which is prophetical of the Catholic Church. He also wrote the two next works, besides many other things, which have been lost. This is the first of those five, which are called \"sapiential,\" giving instructions how to direct our lives, by the dictates of sound reason. (Worthington) --- It is the most important of Solomon's works, though collected by different authors. (Calmet) --- T. Paine treats Solomon as a witty jester. But his <i>jests</i> are of a very serious nature, and no one had before heard of his <i>wit.</i> (Watson)"
