      v:001:
        - '1SA:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>There.</i> Hebrew, Septuagint, &c., "And there," &c. The books of Scripture are thus frequently connected. The authors present us with a series of events, without prefixing any title, or their own names, that our attention may be wholly fixed on what we read. The birth of Samuel being so miraculous, deserves to be recorded, as he was the last judge of Israel, and had so much to do under the first of their kings, whose election and misconduct brought a great change into the state of the commonwealth. (Calmet) --- <i>Ramathaimsophim.</i> Rama, or Ramatha, "a height," and the environs were occupied by the family of Suph, a descendant of Core; (1 Paralipomenon vi. 29.) though the place did not properly belong to the Levites. It lay probably between Gabaa and Bethel, where Samuel spent much of his time, while he was judge, and obliged to be frequently absent from the tabernacle. (Calmet) --- Ragusinus and Prince Radzivil think it was afterwards called Arimathea, the birth-place of Joseph, and now Ramula. (Tirinus) (Chap. ii. 11.) --- <i>Ephraimite.</i> He was of the tribe of Levi, (1 Paraliponmenon vi. 34.) but is called an Ephraimites from dwelling in Mount Ephraim. (Challoner) --- So we read of Cretan Jews, Acts ii. 11. (Tirinus)'
      v:002:
        - '1SA:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Phenenna.</i> She was only of inferior dignity. At that time polygamy was lawful, (Menochius) as Moses insinuates, if he do not expressly allow it.'
      v:003:
        - '1SA:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Days,</i> the three great festivals. His family accompanied him, though the law only lays an express injunction upon the males to attend. We find, however, that females did not neglect to come. (Calmet) --- <i>Hosts.</i> Hebrew (<i>Tsebaoth</i>) of "armies," both of angels and of Israel. God is attended by myriads of angels, and decides the fate of armies. (Haydock) --- This title has not appeared in the former books. The pagans took occasion from it to form their <i>Jupiter Sabazius.</i> (Calmet) --- Elcana might go up from the height of Ramatha to Silo, which was the highest mountain round Jerusalem of all in the holy land. (Adrichom.) (Tirinus)'
      v:004:
        - '1SA:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Sacrificed,</i> by the hand of the priests, (Menochius) who had the breast and right shoulder; the rest was given back to the person who had presented the fattened victim, that he might feast with his friends. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - "1SA:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>With sorrow.</i> Hebrew <i>apayim,</i> \"of faces, indignation, (Calmet) sorrow;\" (Menochius) or that was presented before him. Chaldean and many others translate, \"a chosen:\" (Calmet) Protestants, \"a worthy portion.\" (Haydock) --- The shew-bread is called, \"the bread of the face,\" because it stood before the Lord. Joseph sent to each of his brethren, \"a portion of his faces,\" as the Hebrew expresses it; (Genesis xliii. 33.) or of such meat as was placed upon his table. In the East, the master of a family has all set before him, and he sends to each his portion, to the place where he is sitting. (Chardin, Perse.) --- Thus Elcana sent some more excellent, or \"double,\" part to his beloved Anna, (Calmet) grieving inwardly that she had no children, to whom he might also send. (Haydock) --- By this distinction, he wished to alleviate the sorrow of his wife. (Menochius) --- <i>Womb.</i> Sterility was deemed a curse, and a mark of God's displeasure, with which women were often reproached. Hence Anna prays so earnestly that God would be mindful of her, ver. 11-19. The power of the Almighty, in giving children to the barren, is frequently mentioned, Genesis xxviii. 13., and Psalm cxii. 9. (Calmet) --- Luke i. 25., &c. (Haydock)"
      v:006:
        - '1SA:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Insomuch.</i> Hebrew, "to make her fret, <i>or</i> rage; because the Lord," &c. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - '1SA:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Lord.</i> Then they could hardly avoid being together on the road, and Anna was accustomed to pray earnestly (Menochius) to be delivered from her reproach. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - '1SA:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Silo;</i> either in some private house, or in the porch before the tabernacle. She complied with the entreaty of her husband. (Menochius) --- <i>Stool.</i> Hebrew, "Heli was sitting upon a throne, near the steps, leading to the palace of the Lord." It is also called the temple, or the house of God, though it was only a tent, Matthew xii. 4., &c. Perhaps women were not allowed to go beyond the porch.'
      v:011:
        - '1SA:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>A vow;</i> rightly trusting that her husband would give his consent, Numbers xxx. 7. --- <i>Razor.</i> Hebrew <i>mora,</i> "scissors." Septuagint, "iron." Some copies add, "he shall not drink wine, nor any intoxicating drink." In quality of Levite, Samuel was bound to serve the tabernacle from 25 or 30 years of age till he was 50, Numbers iv. 2. Anna consecrates him to the Lord for life, and promises that he shall be a Nazarite, like Samson, and St. John the Baptist. The law prescribes no rules for these perpetual Nazarites, Numbers vi. 3. Many of the ancients believe that Samuel always observed the prescriptions of Moses, and abstained from intoxicating liquors; though the Hebrew and Vulgate are silent on this head. We find that during his administration as Judge, he was not able to continue always near the tabernacle. (Calmet) --- When he came to years of discretion, he might depart if he thought proper, like other Levites. Had he been of another tribe, he must have been redeemed. (Worthington) --- Esther, Elcana, or Samuel, might have annulled this vow. (Salien, the year of the world 2900.)'
      v:012:
        - '1SA:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Prayers,</i> out of fervour; not through vain superstition and ostentation, as the Pharisees and pagans did, Matthew xxiii. 14. Christ does not condemn many, or long prayers, since he prayed whole nights for our instruction, Luke xxi. 43., and vi. 12., and 1 Thessalonians v. 17. --- <i>Mouth.</i> He tried, but could not hear what she said. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - "1SA:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Much.</i> Heli's \"son or servant,\" ({GREEK:START paidarion}παιδαριον{GREEK:END}, according to the Septuagint) addressed these words to Anna. Her going to pray immediately after a feast, instead of taking recreation, increased the suspicion. (St. Chrysostom, hom. 1.) --- Salien (the year before Christ 1153) observes the many instances of patience which Anna exhibits on this occasion. (Haydock) --- She teaches us not to answer the unjust reproaches of our superiors with haughtiness. (Du Hamel)"
      v:015:
        - '1SA:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>My lord.</i> She gives him this title, though he had called her a drunken woman. (Haydock) --- <i>Unhappy.</i> Hebrew, "of a hard (or afflicted) spirit." See Canticle of Canticles viii. 6. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - '1SA:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Belial;</i> "without restraint;" abandoned. (Haydock) --- Septuagint, "pestiferous." --- <i>Sorrow.</i> Hebrew, "meditation;" (Calmet) what preys upon my spirits. (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - '1SA:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Peace,</i> with all blessings. (Menochius)'
      v:018:
        - '1SA:1:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Eyes:</i> that thou wouldst lay aside thy suspicions against my character, and pray (Calmet) that I may obtain so great a happiness. --- <i>Changed.</i> Hebrew, "no more," as it had been sad, and defaced with tears. (Haydock) --- She was now full of hope and joy. (Menochius) --- Septuagint, "her countenance fell not." She was not moved with anger or with jealousy, Genesis iv. 6. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - '1SA:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>About,</i> at the expiration of the year, which term the ancients frequently allowed between the conception and the nativity, Genesis xviii. 10. --- <i>Samuel.</i> This name imports, <i>asked of God.</i> (Challoner) --- Some letters are omitted for the easier pronunciation, as the Hebrews would now write it, Saul-meel; (Calmet) or it may signify, "God placed him," <i>sum-hal.</i> (Tirinus) --- <i>Shaal</i> means, "to ask." But Vatable thinks that Anna retained only the first letter. (Menochius)'
      v:021:
        - "1SA:1:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Vow,</i> in consequence of his son's nativity. The sacrifice might be of precept, such as the paschal lamb, or for his wife's purification and the redemption of his first-born, as they could not attend in person. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, \"the victim of days and his vow,\" which he had probably made in conjunction with Anna. (Menochius)"
      v:022:
        - '1SA:1:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Weaned.</i> The mother of the Machabees weaned her children when they were three years old; (2 Machabees vii. 27.) which Gallien asserts as the proper time, though Avicenna fixes upon two years. See Genesis xxi. 8. Iremellius translates, "till the child be grown up." But we must not allow any long term, since he was <i>very young</i> when he was presented to the Lord, ver. 24.'
      v:023:
        - '1SA:1:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Word,</i> by preserving the life of the child, (Calmet) and enabling him to serve according to our engagement. (Haydock) --- <i>Word</i> is often put for "a thing," in Hebrew. May God perfect his own work. (Menochius)'
      v:024:
        - '1SA:1:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Three calves.</i> Septuagint, "a calf three years old," such as Abraham sacrificed, Genesis xv. 9. We only find one offered up, ver. 25. --- <i>Bushels.</i> Hebrew <i>epha,</i> (Calmet) each of which contained three bushels or measures, Ruth ii. 17. (Haydock) --- <i>Bottle.</i> Hebrew <i>nebel,</i> a large measure containing above 87 pints. (Calmet) --- The sacrifices seem to have been for thanksgiving, accompanied with an ephi for each calf, and with wine, Numbers xv., and Ezechiel xlvi. 7.'
      v:026:
        - '1SA:1:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Liveth:</i> a strong attestation. (Menochius) --- As sure as you live; or, may you enjoy a long and happy life. See chap. xvii. 55., and xx. 3., Daniel iii. 9., and 2 Esdras ii. 3.'
      v:028:
        - "1SA:1:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Lent.</i> This is equivalent to giving entirely. Anna presents her son to the Lord, to serve in his tabernacle as long as God shall think proper. He dispensed with his personal attendance, when he appointed him judge, chap. vii. 15. (Calmet) --- As much as depended on Samuel's mother, he was consecrated for ever. But he was at liberty to ratify the vow if he pleased. (Menochius) --- The expression, <i>lent,</i> seems to reserve the dominion of the thing, which Anna had entirely given up, so that we might translate the Hebrew, \"Therefore I have him <i>simply</i> as one lent....he is a thing lent, which belongs to the Lord.\" (Calmet) --- <i>They.</i> Hebrew, \"he worshipped the Lord there.\" Grabe found not these words in the Alexandrian copy, which by comparison of this chapter with the the Vatican edition, appears to be more accurate. Both omit this sentence: but it is found in the Aldine edition of the Septuagint Proleg., chap. iv. The Targum adds, \"and she prayed in the spirit of prophecy, and said.\" (Haydock)"

    verses:
      v:001: '1SA:1:1 | 1 | 1 | There was a man of Ramathaimsophim, of Mount Ephraim, and his name was Elcana, the son of Jeroham, the son of Eliu, the son of Thohu, the son of Suph, an Ephraimite:'
      v:002: '1SA:1:2 | 2 | 2 | And he had two wives, the name of one was Anna, and the name of the other Phenenna. Phenenna had children: but Anna had no children.'
      v:003: '1SA:1:3 | 3 | 3 | And this man went up out of his city upon the appointed days, to adore and to offer sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo. And the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were there priests of the Lord.'
      v:004: '1SA:1:4 | 4 | 4 | Now the day came, and Elcana offered sacrifice, and gave to Phenenna, his wife, and to all her sons and daughters, portions:'
      v:005: '1SA:1:5 | 5 | 5 | But to Anna he gave one portion with sorrow, because he loved Anna. And the Lord had shut up her womb.'
      v:006: '1SA:1:6 | 6 | 6 | Her rival also afflicted her, and troubled her exceedingly, insomuch that she upbraided her, that the Lord had shut up her womb:'
      v:007: '1SA:1:7 | 7 | 7 | And thus she did every year, when the time returned, that they went up to the temple of the Lord: and thus she provoked her: but Anna wept, and did not eat.'
      v:008: '1SA:1:8 | 8 | 8 | Then Elcana, her husband, said to her: Anna, why weepest thou? and why dost thou not eat? and why dost thou afflict thy heart? Am not I better to thee than ten children?'
      v:009: '1SA:1:9 | 9 | 9 | So Anna arose after she had eaten and drunk in Silo: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And Heli, the priest, sitting upon a stool before the door of the temple of the Lord;'
      v:010: '1SA:1:10 | 10 | 10 | As Anna had her heart full of grief, she prayed to the Lord, shedding many tears,'
      v:011: '1SA:1:11 | 11 | 11 | And she made a vow, saying: O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt look down, and wilt be mindful of me, and not forget thy handmaid, and wilt give to thy servant a man-child: I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.'
      v:012: '1SA:1:12 | 12 | 12 | And it came to pass, as she multiplied prayers before the Lord, that Heli observed her mouth.'
      v:013: '1SA:1:13 | 13 | 13 | Now Anna spoke in her heart, and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard at all. Heli therefore thought her to be drunk,'
      v:014: '1SA:1:14 | 14 | 14 | And said to her: How long wilt thou be drunk? digest a little the wine, of which thou hast taken too much.'
      v:015: '1SA:1:15 | 15 | 15 | Anna answering, said: Not so, my lord: for I am an exceeding unhappy woman, and have drunk neither wine nor any strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the Lord.'
      v:016: '1SA:1:16 | 16 | 16 | Count not thy handmaid for one of the daughters of Belial: for out of the abundance of my sorrow and grief have I spoken till now.'
      v:017: '1SA:1:17 | 17 | 17 | Then Heli said to her: Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition, which thou hast asked of him.'
      v:018: '1SA:1:18 | 18 | 18 | And she said: Would to God thy handmaid may find grace in thy eyes. So the woman went on her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more changed.'
      v:019: '1SA:1:19 | 19 | 19 | And they rose in the morning, and worshipped before the Lord: and they returned, and came into their house at Ramatha. And Elcana knew Anna his wife: And the Lord remembered her.'
      v:020: '1SA:1:20 | 20 | 20 | And it came to pass when the time was come about, Anna conceived and bore a son, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and called his name Samuel: because she had asked him of the Lord.'
      v:021: '1SA:1:21 | 21 | 21 | And Elcana, her husband, went up, and all his house, to offer to the Lord the solemn sacrifice, and his vow.'
      v:022: '1SA:1:22 | 22 | 22 | But Anna went not up: for she said to her husband: I will not go till the child be weaned, and till I may carry him, that he may appear before the Lord, and may abide always there.'
      v:023: '1SA:1:23 | 23 | 23 | And Elcana, her husband, said to her: Do what seemeth good to thee, and stay till thou wean him: and I pray that the Lord may fulfil his word. So the woman staid at home, and gave her son suck, till she weaned him.'
      v:024: '1SA:1:24 | 24 | 24 | And after she had weaned him, she carried him with her, with three calves, and three bushels of flour, and a bottle of wine, and she brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo. Now the child was as yet very young:'
      v:025: '1SA:1:25 | 25 | 25 | And they immolated a calf, and offered the child to Heli.'
      v:026: '1SA:1:26 | 26 | 26 | And Anna said: I beseech thee, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord: I am that woman, who stood before thee here praying to the Lord.'
      v:027: '1SA:1:27 | 27 | 27 | For this child did I pray, and the Lord hath granted me my petition, which I asked of him.'
      v:028: '1SA:1:28 | 28 | 28 | Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord all the days of his life, he shall be lent to the Lord. And they adored the Lord there. And Anna prayed, and said:'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1SA:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Rejoiced.</i> Septuagint and Chaldean, "been strengthened." Anna composed this canticle at the nativity of her son; or rather at his presentation in the tabernacle. She foretells the reign and glory of the Messias, and of his church. (St. Augustine, de C.[City of God?] xvii. 4.) --- <i>Horn.</i> The <i>horn</i> in the Scripture signifies strength, power, and glory: so the horn is said to be exalted, when a person receives an increase of strength or glory. (Challoner) --- So Horace (3 Ode, 21.) says, <i>addis cornua pauperi.</i> --- <i>Enlarged.</i> Chaldean, "I have opened my mouth, to speak great things against my enemies." She has Phenenna principally in view, and compares her present glory with her former distress. (Calmet) --- I may boast more on account of Samuel, than my rival can of her numerous offspring. (Menochius)'
      v:002:
        - '1SA:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Holy.</i> This is frequently a title of God, the holy one of Israel, Isaias i. 4., and v. 19. He is essentially holy. --- <i>Strong.</i> Hebrew, "no rock like," &c. The rocks of Palestine were the common fortresses of the nation, having caverns to which the people fled for refuge. Hence God is often called a rock, (Calmet) as none can afford such protection. (Haydock) (Psalm xvii. 2., and Deuteronomy xxxii. 15.)'
      v:003:
        - '1SA:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Old.</i> Hebrew <i>hathak</i> means also, "hard things." (Du Hamel) --- "Let arrogance come out of your mouth," to return no more. Yet most people supply the negation from the former member; "Let <i>not</i> arrogance <i>or</i> hard things." Chaldean, "blasphemy," &c. (Calmet) --- Cease to praise idols, as you have done. (Worthington) --- Use not the malevolent language to which you have been accustomed. --- <i>Knowledge.</i> The secrets of hearts are open to him. --- <i>And to him.</i> Hebrew, "and by him actions are weighed," as in scales; (Haydock) or, "thoughts (and actions) are not established." (Symmachus) The Syriac and Arabic also read the negation, "there are not pretexts before him;" or, "are not actions founded upon him?" Will he not execute what he has wisely designed, in spite of opposition? (Haydock) --- Septuagint, "and God prepares his thought;" (Calmet) ({GREEK:START epitedeumata autou}ηπιτηδηυματα αυτου{GREEK:END}) or, "what is convenient for him." (Haydock) --- They have read <i>lu,</i> "of him," instead of <i>la,</i> "not," as they are authorized to do by the Keri, (or various readings in the margin) and by several Hebrew manuscripts. The Protestants think rightly, and suppose that <i>la,</i> "not," has been omitted, "Let <i>not</i> arrogancy;" because we find it in Chaldean, Septuagint, Syriac and Arabic versions. <i>Lu</i> is substituted for <i>la,</i> ver. 16. When some have been pressed with the argument of variations, called Keri, they have said that they were rather explanations of obscure words in the text: but is there any obscurity in <i>lu,</i> "to him," and <i>la,</i> "not;" or can they explain each other? Leusden answers in the affirmative, ver. 16! (Kennicott)'
      v:004:
        - '1SA:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Overcome.</i> Hebrew, "broken." Septuagint, "he has weakened the bow," having deprived it of its elasticity.'
      v:005:
        - '1SA:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Many.</i> Hebrew, "seven," which is often used in the same sense. Anna had never more than six children; (Calmet) whereas Phenenna had perhaps ten, chap. i. 8., and iii. 21. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins pretend that she lost one every time that Anna brought forth. But the text says nothing of the kind. It only insinuates at most, that she had no more. This admirably represents the state of the Synagogue, compared to the Christian Church. (St. Augustine, sup.) (Calmet; Worthington) --- The blessed Virgin conveys the same idea in other words, Luke i. (Menochius)'
      v:006:
        - '1SA:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Hell,</i> (<i>infernos,</i>) "the lower regions." God calls us out of this world, or restores the dead to life, as he thinks proper. (Haydock) --- He easily makes the greatest prosperity succeed extreme distress, which is often denoted by death, hell, &c. So Seneca says, <i>Mortis habet vices---Lentis cum trahitur vita gemitibus.</i> The prodigal son is said to have come to life again, when his father received him, contrary to his expectations, Luke xv. 24., and Psalm xxix. 4., &c. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - "1SA:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Exalteth.</i> The same instances of God's power and providence are related, Psalm cxii. 7., and Luke i. 52. (Menochius) --- Hesiod (op.) says, \"Jupiter easily gives or takes away power,\" &c."
      v:008:
        - '1SA:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>World.</i> The Hebrews represented the earth as resting on a firm basis, or on pillars, or turning on poles, Psalm ciii. 5., and Proverbs viii. 25., &c. The magistrates of the earth may be also thus designated, as the world is entrusted to their care. God compares Jeremias to an iron pillar, Jeremias i. 18., and Apocalypse iii. 12. (Calmet) --- The last sentence is omitted in the Septuagint.'
      v:009:
        - '1SA:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Saints.</i> Hebrew, "kind, merciful, pious ones;" (Calmet) those to whom he shews mercy, and who comply with his will in assisting others. Septuagint, "Granting their petition to those who ask him, and he has blessed the years of the just, because man is not strong by <i>his own</i> strength." (Haydock) --- <i>Silent:</i> condemned to death. <i>Mox etiam Lemures animas dixere silentes.</i> (Ovid, Fast. v.) <i>Loca nocte silentia late.</i> (Virgil, [Æneid?] vi.) Unable to act as they had done, and ashamed of themselves, (Calmet) they seek for the most obscure retreat, where they may not behold the glory of those whom they have despised. They will pray that the hills would fall upon them, and hide them from the indignation of the Lamb. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - '1SA:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Him.</i> Septuagint, "The Lord will render his adversary weak. The holy Lord. Let not the prudent boast of his prudence," &c. (Haydock; which seems to be added from Jeremias ix. 23., Calmet) "The Lord has mounted the heavens, and thundered. He judges the ends of the earth, and gives power to those who rule, as kings, over us," &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Heavens.</i> This prediction against the Philistines was exactly verified, chap. vii. 10. It denotes the protection which God grants to his servants, Psalm xvii. 8, 14. --- <i>Christ.</i> Chaldean, and the best interpreters, understand this of the Messias: "He will multiply the kingdom of his Messias." (Jonathan) --- Anna might also have David in view, who was one of his most express figures. (Calmet) --- But neither he, nor Solomon, ever ruled over all the earth, as Christ will, Psalm ii. 18. (Worthington) --- Zachary seems to allude to this text, Luke i. 69. (Calmet) --- The empire of Christ rose from the smallest beginnings. (Menochius)'
      v:011:
        - '1SA:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Ramatha.</i> Hebrew <i>Rama.</i> Septuagint Alexandrian, "and they left him there before the Lord, and went away to Armathaim." (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - '1SA:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>The Lord,</i> whom they denied by their works, Titus i. 16.'
      v:013:
        - "1SA:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Nor the office.</i> The Vulgate repeats the negation from the preceding sentence. Others translate, \"The priests' custom with the people <i>was,</i>\" &c., or, \"the <i>pretended</i> right of the priests,\" &c. They neither performed their duty towards God, (Calmet) nor were they content with what the law authorized them to receive from the people. (Haydock) --- <i>Servant,</i> or son; perhaps Ophni or Phinees. --- <i>Boiling.</i> In the heroic times, the meat was never boiled, but roasted. (Athen. i. 10.; and Servius; though Hesiod asserts the contrary, ver. 748. (Calmet) --- Abulensis (q. 8.) observes that the person who offered the victim, boiled the parts which belonged to himself, as well as the priest's share. But, whereas in the peace-offerings, only the breast and the right shoulder fell to the priest, these rapacious men took whatever they pleased. (Menochius)"
      v:014:
        - '1SA:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Pan.</i> Hebrew has also four terms, but their precise meaning cannot be determined. The vessels were of different forms, or intended for various uses.'
      v:015:
        - '1SA:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Raw.</i> Here are two other abuses. The fat ought first to have been burnt, in honour of the Lord; and the meat should have been boiled, in order that the priest might not be taken off from his sacred functions; as custom, it seems, had determined, though the law be silent on this head.'
      v:016:
        - '1SA:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Desireth.</i> The Laic gives an example of moderation and zeal, to which the priest might well have paid some deference. The former is willing to abandon his goods, provided the honour of God be not neglected. (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - '1SA:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Lord.</i> People, seeing that the law was not observed, refrained from presenting victims. (Menochius) --- They are but too apt to follow the bad example of their teachers. (Haydock) --- Hence God punishes the smallest faults of his ministers, with great severity, since they withdraw people from his service, by their scandalous behaviour, and are guilty of a more horrid sacrilege than those who laid violent hands on the Lord of majesty. (St. Bernard, ser. i.) Nothing brings a greater discredit on religion. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - '1SA:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Ephod.</i> It was not, therefore, peculiar to priests, 2 Kings vi. 14.'
      v:019:
        - '1SA:2:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Coat.</i> Hebrew <i>mehil,</i> the outer garment. Hence it appears that the parents of the people consecrated to the Lord, furnished them with clothes, till they were able to serve the tabernacle, otherwise they would have been a burden to it. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - '1SA:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Lent.</i> This was in reply to what Anna had said, chap. i. 28. (Haydock) --- God always gives back with interest. (Menochius)'
      v:021:
        - "1SA:2:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Lord.</i> He behaved well in the tabernacle, (Calmet) notwithstanding the ill example of Heli's own sons. (Haydock)"
      v:022:
        - "1SA:2:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Waited,</i> like an army of guards, Exodus xxxviii. 8. The Rabbins pretend that these priests only sent away these women who came to be purified, and allowed them to return to their husbands before the appointed time, and thus caused the latter to offend. These authors are generally very fertile in discoveries. (Calmet) --- The virgins or widows gave themselves up to work for the tabernacle. (Menochius) --- The sons of Heli found an opportunity in the sacred practices of religion to gratify their passions. Perhaps some false pastors in the Church of Christ may have imitated their perversity. A man of the character of Mr. Crowley, a late deserter of the Catholic faith, judging of others by the corruption of his own heart, would hence insinuate that they all take these liberties, or at least that it is \"a miracle,\" if they can admit females to confession, without yielding to such base temptations. If this be a miracle, we may confidently hope that wonders have not ceased, otherwise among his other malicious remarks, he would surely have adduced some proofs of his assertion, from the records of past ages. But in reality he seems to be little acquainted (though he pretends to have been converted by it, &c., and falsely asserts it is kept from laymen) either with history or with the Bible, having read perhaps little more than what his Catechism set before him; and this he boldly contradicts, as if he supposed that his \"Thoughts\" would have more weight than the decisions of the Fathers and of the whole Church. If he can find a professor of Maynooth, and another or two Irish priests, disposed to follow his example, (which we need not believe on his assertion) what would this prove? Yet Mr. Slack lays great stress on this man's authority, in his late defence of Wesley. (Letters to R. Campion, Esq. Whitby, 1811.) So ready are the enemies of the Catholic faith to scrape together every idle remark that may tend to defame the mother Church! So eager are infidels to reject the faith, on account of the misconduct of some of its degenerate professors! (Haydock) --- The best of fathers have often very profligate children, as the latter take pride in the honours of their family, and expect to obtain the same without trouble. (Grotius)"
      v:023:
        - '1SA:2:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>People.</i> They could not refrain from complaining of the iniquity of his children, how much soever they might revere him. Though he was not a witness himself of their abominations, such an uproar must have convinced him that they were guilty. (Haydock) --- The Fathers in general blame the lenity of the high priest, who ought not only to have rebuked, but also to have put a stop to the crying sins of his sons, by the utmost severity. (Calmet)'
      v:025:
        - '1SA:2:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Who shall pray for him.</i> By these words Heli would have his sons understand, that by their wicked abuse of sacred things, and of the very sacrifices which were appointed to appease the Lord, they deprived themselves of the ordinary means of reconciliation with God; which was by sacrifices. The more, because as they were the <i>chief priests,</i> whose business it was to intercede for all others, they had no other to offer sacrifice and make atonement for them. (Challoner) --- We need not, however, consider the words of Heli as an oracle of God. (Sanchez) --- In human transactions, a person would find more difficulty in obtaining pardon, when the judge himself had received the injury. Septuagint, instead of <i>appeased,</i> have "and they shall pray for him." (Menochius) --- Some may be found to plead his cause, but if he have offended the judge, who will undertake to be his advocate? What medicines shall be used, when those, which God has appointed, are trodden under foot? (Haydock) --- By persevering in such wickedness, no redress can be expected: and indeed, the infinite distance between God and man, would place an insuperable obstacle to a reconciliation, if Jesus Christ had not undertaken the cause even of the most desperate sinner. (Calmet) --- <i>Because the Lord would slay them.</i> In consequence of their manifold sacrileges, he would not soften their hearts with his efficacious grace, but was determined to destroy them. (Challoner) --- They had filled up the measure of their crimes; and, though God wills not the death of a sinner, they had treasured up to themselves wrath, which he will now display. We might also translate <i>ci,</i> "therefore," (Noldius; Osee ix. 15, &c.) or "that." They would not be convinced that the threat of their father would be executed. (Schmid) (Calmet) --- Sins directly against God, and which hinder his service, are remitted with greater difficulty, though to all true penitents pardon is promised, Ezechiel xxxiii. God did not take away the free will of Ophni and Phinees, but left them to their own obstinacy, and justly punished them. See St. Augustine, contra Jul. v. 3. (Worthington) --- They had already rendered themselves unworthy of extraordinary graces. (Tirinus) (St. Thomas Aquinas, 1 p. q. 23, n. 3.)'
      v:026:
        - '1SA:2:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>And men.</i> Thus he is, in some degree, compared with our Saviour, Luke ii. 52. When one minister prevaricates, God presently raises up another, so that he never abandons his Church. (Haydock)'
      v:027:
        - "1SA:2:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>A man.</i> His name is unknown. Some say it was Elcana, Samuel or an angel, &c. The Rabbins suppose that Phinees performed this office. But he was long ago dead, (Calmet) or he would still have enjoyed the high priesthood instead of Heli. --- <i>Father's.</i> Aaron was the chief both of the house of Eleazar and of Ithamar, and was selected by God to be his ambassador and priest. (Haydock) --- His posterity held the high priesthood till after the reign of Herod. (Tirinus)"
      v:028:
        - '1SA:2:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Ephod,</i> and all the pontifical attire. (Haydock) --- The high priest wore a different sort of ephod from that of other people. (Calmet) --- <i>All the,</i> &c. Even of the holocausts, the priests received the skin. (Menochius)'
      v:029:
        - '1SA:2:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Away,</i> by scandalizing the people, and causing them to neglect offering the appointed victims. (Haydock) --- <i>To eat.</i> Heli seems to have refrained from divesting his sons of their high office, that the riches of his family might not be impaired. (Calmet) --- Avarice is the root of many evils, and those who seek to become rich fall into many snares. Poverty soon overtook the descendants of Heli, while the immediate perpetrators of the wickedness were punished with death. (Haydock)'
      v:030:
        - "1SA:2:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Ever.</i> God had promised the priesthood to Aaron's seed (Calmet) as long as the Jewish religion should subsist. (Haydock) --- He had also selected the branch of Eleazar, to recompense the zeal of Phinees; (Numbers xxv. 13,) and yet we find that the house of Ithamar had possession for a time of the high priesthood. We know not when or by what means by obtained it. The promises of God to them were surely only conditional; and some think that they only meant, that as He had permitted them to acquire this high dignity, so it was an earnest that he would not deprive them of it, unless they proved unworthy. But it is generally supposed that God had expressed his determination of this head. Heli, Achitob, Achias, Achimelech, and Abiathar, (Calmet) were the only pontiffs of the family of Ithamar. The last was obliged to resign to (Haydock) Sadoc, under the reign of Solomon, 3 Kings ii. 27. Some suppose that Heli usurped this dignity, (Capel) when he entered upon the civil administration, as the people thought none more fit for the office, in a time of trouble. (Bertram.) --- Others think that the descendants of Eleazar forfeited this honour by their crimes or indolence, or because they were not of sufficient age. But this reason would not have excluded them for ever. The Scripture, therefore, insinuates that Heli was appointed by God, and that his descendants would have enjoyed his office, if they had not offended. (Calmet) --- These promises were of a conditional nature both to Phinees and to Heli, and Sadoc, ver. 35. See Numbers xxv., &c. (Haydock) --- God never changes. (Menochius)"
      v:031:
        - '1SA:2:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Arm,</i> strength or children. I will slay some; others I will reduce to extreme want. Some explain it of the ark, which was the protection of Israel. (Calmet) --- <i>Old man,</i> to govern. (Du Hamel) --- It is often a title of dignity. But the four succeeding pontiffs did not live long. In the course of little more than 100 years, the last was deposed. (Calmet)'
      v:032:
        - "1SA:2:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Thy rival.</i> A priest of another race. This was partly filled when Abiathar, of the race of Heli, was removed from the priesthood, and <i>Sadoc,</i> who was of another line, was substituted in his place. But it was more fully accomplished in the New Testament, when the priesthood of Aaron gave place to that of Christ. (Challoner) --- Some suppose that this rival was Samuel, in whom this prediction was partly fulfilled, though more completely in Christ. (Ven. Bede, q.) (Menochius) --- Heli saw not in person the exaltation of Eleazar's family. Hebrew and other version are very much embarrassed here. (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"and thou shalt see an enemy <i>in my</i> habitation, in all <i>the wealth</i> which <i>God</i> shall give Israel.\" (Haydock)"
      v:033:
        - "1SA:2:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Spent.</i> Hence we may learn to adore the depth of God's judgments, who knows how to punish both in life and death. --- <i>Part.</i> Septuagint, \"the most exalted of thy house shall fall by the sword of men.\""
      v:035:
        - '1SA:2:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Faithful</i> often denotes what shall continue a long time, Isaias xxxiii. 16., and lv. 3. (Calmet) --- But in the conduct of Sadoc, we find nothing reprehensible. (Menochius) --- This faithful priest pointed out the Christian priesthood, as the sequel shews. (Calmet) --- <i>All days.</i> He shall perform his office. (Haydock) --- <i>Anointed,</i> king Solomon. (Menochius) --- The priests of the new law ought always to have Christ in view. (Calmet)'
      v:036:
        - "1SA:2:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Bread;</i> like the poorest sort of people. (Menochius) --- Being degraded, they shall ask the other priests to offer sacrifice for them. Hebrew, \"shall bend before him for a piece of silver, and for a morsel of bread.\" He shall humbly intreat to be employed as a priest, in order to get a livelihood. --- The <i>piece of silver.</i> Hebrew <i>agorath,</i> probably denotes the <i>gerah,</i> the smallest coin, or what was given for a day's wages. <i>Agor</i> means to hire, in Chaldean, Syriac, &c. Hence the Greek, {GREEK:START agorazo}αγοραζο{GREEK:END}, \"I purchase.\" --- <i>Office.</i> The priests served in their turns; (1 Paralipomenon xxiv.) so that the descendants of Heli must have been entitled to a subsistence. But whether God punished them, by requiring that they should ask the high priest for this, as for a favour, or this was required of all the inferior priests before they could be employed, or whether, in fine, the descendants of Abiathar were reduced to the condition of Levites, or wholly degraded, we know not. See 4 Kings xxiii. 9., and Ezechiel xliv. 10. (Calmet) --- They may petition for a part of the victims which fell to the share of the priests, (Menochius) and might be eaten by any that was not defiled. (Haydock)"

(Worthington) --- Some prophets had appeared under the former judges: but they were not so common as they were from the days of Samuel, till a little after the captivity. St. Peter ranks Samuel in the first place, Acts iii. 24. (Calmet) --- <i>Vision.</i> No prophet was publicly recognized, to whom the people might have recourse. (Menochius)'

(Worthington) --- <i>Samuel slept.</i> Some would transpose these words to the end of the verse, as they think it improbable that Samuel should be in the place where the high priest himself could enter only once a year. (Vatable, &c.) --- But this change seems harsh and unnecessary, as Heli and Samuel might be in apartments contiguous to the holy place. (Sanctius; Menochius; Calmet) --- During the night none of the priests would be in the sanctuary, so that Heli might form a judgment that none of them had called Samuel. (Tirinus)'

(Menochius) --- Aquila, "he did not look black at them," nor avert his eyes with horror.

Nothing could withhold the indignation of the Lord, in correcting the sinner, though he would shew mercy eternally to the penitent. But he saw the obstinacy of these priests, and their unhappy end. The sacrifices of the old law always presupposed suitable internal sentiments, to grant the remission of sin; and even for the avoiding of the legal punishments, they must have been offered in a true spirit of religion, which these abandoned wretches despised and neglected. (Calmet) --- God threatens that he will punish their crimes for ever, as he abominates the contempt of priests. (Tirinus)'

(Calmet) particularly as light was beginning to appear, when he was called by God, ver. 3. --- <i>Doors.</i> Some walls had probably been built, to enclose the curtains of the tabernacle. A priest would have been employed to open the sanctuary. (Calmet)'

        - '1SA:3:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Sight.</i> Some of the Fathers think that these words proceeded from an habitual indifference, as he was not disposed to molest his sons any farther, let the consequences be what they might. (St. Gregory; St. Ephrem, &c.) --- But others believe, that Heli was actuated by the spirit of humanity and resignation, and saved his soul. (Calmet) See chap. iv. 18. --- <i>Years.</i> The author of the Concord. between the Books of Kings and of Chronicles, thinks Samuel was then 39. (Du Hamel)'

(Haydock) --- They were concerned in the prediction which was denounced against the house of Heli. (Menochius) --- Septuagint, "and Samuel was entrusted to be the prophet of the Lord, to all Israel, from the ends of the earth to the ends: And Heli was very old, and his sons going went forward, and their way was wicked before the Lord." Thus they usher in the following catastrophe. (Haydock)'

      v:001:
        - "1SA:4:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>And.</i> Hebrew inserts here the conclusion of the last verse, whence some would infer that Samuel told the Israelites to make war upon the Philistines. But as it turned out so ill, this would have tended to discredit him; and we find that the Philistines were the aggressors. --- <i>Days.</i> This war took place immediately after the threats denounced to Heli; (Sararius) or according to Usher, and the best chronologists, about 27 years after that event. (Calmet) --- The addition of the Septuagint seems to insinuate, that the sons of Heli persevered for a long time in their wicked course, chap. iii. 20. (Haydock) --- Josephus says that Phinees was his father's coadjutor. --- Salien observes that this must be considered as a fresh blot in the character of the latter, since he ought to have delivered the delinquents up to execution, Deuteronomy xxi. 21. Tirin[Tirinus], on the contrary, adduces the power of his sons, and the debilitated state of Heli, to excuse his neglect. (Haydock) --- <i>Help.</i> In Hebrew <i>Eben-ezer;</i> so called, from the <i>help</i> which the Lord was pleased afterwards to give to his people, Israel, in that place, by the prayers of Samuel, chap. vii. 12., (Challoner) about 21 years afterwards. --- <i>Aphec,</i> in the tribe of Juda, not far from Maspha."
      v:002:
        - '1SA:4:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Here,</i> &c. Hebrew, "in the field" of battle. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "in the ranks, in the field." (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - '1SA:4:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Ancients;</i> the commanders of the respective tribes. Heli was not able to lead on the people to battle, on account of his blindness and great age. --- <i>Enemies.</i> All nations attribute much to the exterior marks of religion. The Israelites had witnessed the victories which had been obtained while the ark was present, Josue vi. 4. See Numbers xiv. 45. But they ought to have considered, that their infidelity rendered them unworthy of the divine protection; and that God was more displeased at their profanations, than at the indignity to which the sacred vessels would be exposed. He would know how to vindicate his own honour and glory. The symbols of religion were thus carried in the army, by the Persians, &c. (Herodotus vii.) --- The Romans regarded their standards as so many deities. (Halicar. vi.) See 2 Kings vi. 21., and 2 Paralipomenon xiii. 8. (Calmet) --- The confidence which the Israelites placed in the ark was commendable, but their sins deserved to be punished. (Worthington) (Numbers x. 35.)'
      v:004:
        - '1SA:4:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Ark.</i> On this extraordinary emergency they thought it lawful. (Abulensis, q. 6.) --- They easily obtained the consent of Heli; and his sons went to take it down, and to attend it to the army, as he was incapable of doing duty. We know not what ceremonies were used, nor whether the brothers acted as high priests alternately. (Calmet) --- <i>Cherubim.</i> The Scripture often represents God in this manner, Exodus xxv. 22., Psalm xvii. 10., and Ezechiel x. 1. The commonality of the Jews attributed bodies to the angels, but to denote that they were not like those with which we are acquainted, they called them cherubim, or complex and unusual figures. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - '1SA:4:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>God:</i> "Elohim." Septuagint, "these gods." They speak of the true God according to their false ideas. (Calmet) --- <i>Sighing.</i> Septuagint, "deliver us, O Lord, this day."'
      v:008:
        - '1SA:4:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Joy.</i> A few days ago the Hebrews were dismayed, now they shout for joy, as they did at the taking of Jericho. Hebrew and Septuagint, "it was not so heretofore." (Haydock) --- <i>Gods.</i> Hebrew may be rendered in the singular, with the Chaldean and Arabic. But the Septuagint and most commentators, explain it in the sense of the Vulgate. The title of high, (<i>adirim</i>) or magnificent, was given by the Philistines to Dagon, whom they styled Atergatis. (Calmet) --- Septuagint {GREEK:START stereon}στηρηον{GREEK:END}, means, "stable, perfect," &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Plagues,</i> till they were overwhelmed in the Red Sea, which is surrounded with deserts. Some supply, "and (<i>his people</i>) in the desert." (Septuagint, Syriac, &c.) (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - '1SA:4:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Fight.</i> To serve those whom they had lately oppressed, would be doubly afflicting. (Salien) --- If these people had seriously attended to the instructions, which they might have derived from the fall of others, they would surely never have exposed themselves to fight against the high God. But they looked upon him in no other light than their own contemptible idols. Homer often represents them as wounded, and conquered by mortal men.'
      v:010:
        - "1SA:4:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Footmen.</i> They had no cavalry, (Calmet) as God seemed to discourage any. (Haydock) --- Even after Solomon's time, they had not many horsemen. (Calmet) --- The Israelites had before lost 4,000: now when they were full of confidence, and fought with valour, they behold 30,000 fall. The ark proved thus fatal to them. (Haydock)"
      v:011:
        - '1SA:4:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Slain.</i> Abulensis (q. 17,) thinks they were fighting in defence of the ark, when they might have saved themselves by flight; so that he does not despair of their salvation. God permitted them to lose their lives in the exercise of a holy ministry, which they had so scandalously profaned. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - '1SA:4:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Man.</i> The Jews say that Saul carried these melancholy tidings, and that Goliah slew the sons of Heli. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - '1SA:4:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Stool.</i> Hebrew <i>cisse;</i> "a throne or tribunal," where Heli sat to decide any controversies, and where he had blessed the mother of Samuel. (Calmet) --- <i>God.</i> He had great reason to fear that this was the day when his sons would perish, and he apprehended that the ark would be in danger. (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - '1SA:4:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Taken.</i> Every sentence expresses something more distressing to the aged judge and father; the flight and slaughter of his people, the ruin of his children, and the loss of the ark, which must have filled all Israel with a mortal gloom and terror, lest God should have abandoned them. So many dismal circumstances oppressing the heart of Heli, he fainted away, and falling backwards, expired. (Haydock) --- The Scripture takes notice of his great age, that we might not think that he killed himself in despair. (Salien)'
      v:018:
        - '1SA:4:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Named the ark,</i> &c. There is great reason, by all these circumstances, to hope that Heli died in the state of grace; and by his temporal punishments, escaped the eternal. (Challoner) --- But many of the Fathers condemn him, and the Scripture says nothing of his conversion, or of that of his children, so that the matter is doubtful. (Calmet) --- <i>Years.</i> Hebrew, "and heavy." --- <i>Forty.</i> Septuagint, "twenty," in which they are followed by many Fathers. (Eusebius; Sulpit., &c.) --- Some reconcile the two texts by saying, that Heli and Samson judged together for twenty years. But the Septuagint is probably corrupted, as the other versions agree with the original. (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - '1SA:4:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Sudden,</i> through extreme affliction. (Menochius) --- Josephus says the child was only in his seventh month, but alive. Abulensis thinks he did not long survive his mother.'
      v:021:
        - "1SA:4:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Ichabod.</i> That is, <i>Where is the glory?</i> or, <i>there is no glory.</i> We see how much the Israelites lamented the loss of the ark, which was but the symbol of God's presence amongst them. How much more ought Christians lament the loss of God himself, when by sin they have drove him out of their souls? (Challoner) --- The ark is often called the glory of Israel, Isaias lxiv. 21., and Psalm xxv. 8. Ichabod might remind the people that the greatest loss had been sustained by them, as well as by his family. His mother had both in view the <i>ark,</i> Heli, and Phinees, <i>her husband,</i> (Haydock) when she exclaimed, <i>icabod,</i> \"Woe! or, Alas! the glory.\" (Mendoza) --- The Scripture does not mention Ophni's posterity. But besides this posthumous son, Phinees had one elder, who now succeeded Heli in the pontificate, (Chap. xiv. 3.; Josephus; Salien, the year of the world 2940, the year before Christ 1113,) while Samuel took possession of the civil administration, and almost totally eclipsed the glory of Achitob. Many of the Fathers have even looked upon him as the high priest. But he was only a Levite, though, by dispensation, he acted sometimes as an extraordinary priest. (St. Jerome, contra Jov. i., and in 1 Cor.) He reduced the people to a sense of their duty, and taught them to trust in the true God alone, and they would be protected, though deprived of the ark. This was also presently restored to them. (Haydock)"

It is astonishing that God permits these infidels to touch the ark, He who resented the conduct of Oza, and of the Bethsamites, with such severity. But the law regarded the Israelites, and the pagans were ignorant of it. (Calmet) --- The servant, who knows his master will, and does not obey, shall suffer many stripes; [Luke xii. 47.] and those who have the happiness of professing the true religion, and dishonour it by their immorality, must expect to feel the heavy hand of the judge, much more than ignorant unbelievers.

Theodoret (q. 10,) concludes, that the people imagined the mortality proceeded from some natural cause; (Calmet) otherwise it would have been very absurd to give such advice, as the ark would spread the contagion throughout the country, by being removed. From Geth it was sent to Accaron, when the magistrates of the city objected to its being admitted, ver. 10. Jospehus says, however, that it visited all the five principal cities, as if to punish them for their impiety. (Haydock)'

To convince all, they try an experiment, which would decide the matter; and in case the ark went back, some suitable presents must accompany it, as a propitiation (Haydock) for the sin which they would not (Menochius) then doubt had been incurred. (Haydock) --- Though God stands in need of nothing, all must acknowledge their dependence on him. The pagans always made some present, when they appeared before their idols or monarchs, and God requires the like testimony of submission, Exodus xxiii. 15.'

Some believe that He inspired them on this occasion, (Estius) that even his enemies might be convinced, (Haydock) the grace of prophecy being frequently granted to wicked men, like Balaam: others believe that He gave success to their plan, though it was dictated by superstition.

Males indeed were to be offered in the tabernacle. But this was an extraordinary case; so that, if there were no priests, the sacrifice might be lawful (Calmet) by dispensation, as we see Samuel and Elias did the like. (Haydock) --- The kine and cart being consecrated to God, it was thought that they could not be turned to a more suitable purpose. (Calmet) --- The ark was also present, on account of which, sacrifices were offered in the tabernacle. The arguments of Abulensis, (q. 19,) who accuses the Bethsamites of sin on this account, are not therefore satisfactory. (Menochius)'

Clarius thinks they also sent an equal number of the other images of the anus, chap. v. (Haydock)'

T.[Tirinus?]) Hebrew, "or mourning," was so called afterwards, on account of so many being slain; (Menochius) so the place, to which the Egyptians accompanied the remains of Jacob, was styled "Abol," <i>the mourning of Egypt,</i> Genesis l. 11. (Haydock) --- The Septuagint read <i>Abon,</i> "the stone." All the towns belonging to the Philistines, as far as this place, sent each their golden images, or contributed towards those which were presented by the five lords. --- <i>Which,</i> ark, according to the Vulgate, though some would explain it of the stone. The ark might remain here for some time, and would probably have continued longer, if the people had not been so much afflicted. In the mean time, this record may have been written, as it was afterwards inserted in this book. (Calmet) --- <i>Which,</i> though of the feminine gender, is referred to stone, because Abol is of that description, (Menochius) and we find several such allusions to the Hebrew in our version. Protestants, "unto the great <i>stone of</i> Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the Lord, <i>which stone remaineth</i> unto this day," &c. (Haydock; Vatable, &c.) --- Others think that the ark remained there till it was removed to Cariathiarim, chap. vii. 1. Malvenda says, the <i>memory</i> of the transaction was fresh till the author wrote; while others maintain, that the golden figures continued with the ark till that time. (Calmet) --- The Roman Septuagint omits the words <i>till this day;</i> and reads, "where they placed upon it (the stone) the ark....upon the stone in the field," &c. Then with the Alexandrian copy, and Procopius, &c., it subjoins 19. "And the sons of Jechonias did not approve, among the men of Bethsames, that they saw the ark of the Lord, and he slew of them 70 men, and 50,000 of the people." Theodoret suspects that they were more impious than the rest. But we might as well say that they shewed more (Calmet) reverence, as we may explain <i>slew of them,</i> to denote the two curious citizens, (Haydock) if any dependence could be had on this addition.

        - '1SA:6:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Seen;</i> and curiously looked into. It is likely this plague reached to all the neighbouring country, as well as the city of Bethsames. (Challoner) --- For we need not suppose that all these deaths took place in one day. The ark seems to have continued there for some time, ver. 18. Hebrew, "because they had looked into, <i>or</i> at the ark." (Haydock) --- It was unlawful, even for the Levites, to touch or to look <i>at</i> the ark uncovered; (Tirinus; Numbers iv. 15, 20,) and the Hebrew expression <i>into,</i> is often taken in this sense, Proverbs vii. 15., and xi. 4. --- <i>Men</i> of rank. (St. Gregory, &c.) "Ancients," Chaldean. Some would suppose that only these 70 perished, and were of as much value as 50,000 of the common people: for they will not allow that the latter number was slain. Out of that number, 70 were made victims of the divine justice. (Tirinus; Sa) --- Bochart translates, "he slew 70 out of 50,000." The Syriac and Arabic read, "5070 men." Josephus only admits 70 who were slain, "because they dared to touch the ark with their profane hands, as they were not priests." Hebrew, "and he slew of the people 70 men, 50,000 men. (Calmet) --- Kennicott seems to suspect that a cipher has been added in the Hebrew at the end. Protestants, "50,000, and threescore and ten men." (Haydock) --- Some would insert <i>aderant</i> in the Vulgate, and 50,000 "were present." (Du Hamel) --- The Chaldean, Septuagint, &c., constantly retain these numbers, and we must not judge of God severity by our feeble reason. (Calmet) --- This decision is the most common. (Menochius) --- The people had indulged their curiosity, to see whether the Philistines had taken the tables of the law out of the ark, &c. (Serarius) --- As the ark was terrible to the infidels, so it was also to those true believers, who treated it with disrespect. (Worthington)'
      v:020:
        - '1SA:6:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Us.</i> These words may denote that they thought God too severe, or else, that they judged themselves unworthy of his presence. There is no proportion between an offence of God, and what the creature can do to make him satisfaction. (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - "1SA:6:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Up.</i> This is the import of the Hebrew. The Vulgate <i>reducite,</i> \"bring it back,\" insinuates, that the Bethsamites desired the people of Cariathiarim to convey the ark to their city, on the road to Silo, where they probably thought it ought to be placed, in the tabernacle. But it seems God ordered it otherwise, and the ark was never restored to its former splendid station, surrounded with all the vessels and ornaments of the tabernacle. David made something similar, and place an altar before it, while the Mosaic tabernacle and altar were removed from Silo to Nobe, (chap. xxi. 1.) and afterwards to Gabaon, 2 Paralipomenon i. 5. Salien (the year of the world 3030) doubts not but they were thence translated to Solomon's temple, during the octave of the dedication, along with those of David, from Mount Sion, 2 Paralipomenon v. 2., and viii. 3. Why the ark was not placed in this most magnificent abode, but removed from the stone of Abel to the houses of Abinadab, of Obededom, of David in Sion, till all the original ornaments, prescribed by God to Moses, with a still more splendid apparatus, met to adorn the temple of Solomon, we cannot easily explain. Perhaps it might be to render that event more glorious, and to represent the troubled state of the Jewish Synagogue, immediately preceding the appearance of the great Redeemer, who would establish a church without spot or wrinkle, shining brighter than the sun, and replenished with all heavenly graces. (Haydock) --- Cariathiarim is the same place as Cariathbaal, and Baala, (Josue xv. 9, 60.) Baalim Juda, (2 Kings vi. 2.) and Sedeiarim, about ten miles from Jerusalem. Gabaa was \"a hill,\" (Calmet) belonging to the same city, where the house of Abinadab stood; (Haydock) and Nobe was also in the vicinity, while Silo was much farther north. (Calmet) --- The priests still remained, and offered sacrifice in the tabernacle, though occasionally some of them might come to offer extraordinary victims before the ark, in those private houses which were thus converted, as it were, into the holy of holies. Salien, the year of the world 2941, where he observes from St. Jerome, that the tabernacle was removed to Nobe about the same time as the ark was deposited at Cariathiarim; and no doubt both the translations were in consequence of the divine command, signified by the mouth of his prophet Samuel.

        - '1SA:7:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>In Gabaa.</i> That is, on the hill, for Gabaa signifieth a hill. (Challoner) (1 Paralipomenon xiii. 6.) --- It was perhaps the citadel, (Haydock) or an elevated situation, such as were generally chosen for the temples both of the true and of false gods. (Calmet) --- <i>Abinadab</i> was a Levite of renowned virtue. (Menochius) --- The people of this city knew that the ark was a source of blessings to those who received it with respect; and, that the Bethsamites had been punished only for their irreverence. (Worthington) --- Samuel was first consulted before the people, in a body, undertook to remove the ark; and here he was probably recognized for the judge of Israel, in which character he henceforward appears, exhorting all to obey the Lord with sincerity. He appoints a general assembly at Masphath, to enter into a solemn covenant with the Lord, and to adopt means for recovering their liberty. We have only a very concise account of these important transactions, owing to the modesty of the author, which the Holy Spirit would teach us to imitate. (Calmet) --- <i>Sanctified.</i> Chaldean, "set over," (Menochius) prepared by suitable purifications, &c. (Calmet) --- Some think, that Eleazar received the priestly or the Levitical consecration, Numbers viii. 7. We have no proof that he was of the family of Aaron, nor does his name occur in the genealogies of the Levites, as they are perhaps too short. Josephus ([Antiquities?] vi. 2.) asserts that he was a Levite. (Calmet) --- But even a laic, like Obededon of Geth, might have been the guardian of the ark, as he would not have to touch it. (Salien, the year before Christ 1112) --- Eleazar had two brothers, who acted in the same capacity when David intended to remove the ark to Sion. At that time he was perhaps dead, or decrepit, as his father might be on this occasion. (Haydock) --- It is not improbable but they were of the race of Aaron. (Tirinus)'

But is it credible that Samuel should neglect for twenty years to make this exhortation to the people? and how will it be true, that God humbled the Philistines during the whole time (Calmet) of his administration, which perhaps (Haydock) only lasted so many years? (ver. 13.) (Calmet) --- It is more probable, therefore, that the power of the enemy was broken by the destruction caused by the presence of the ark, which kept them under due restraint for a long time; and when they attempted, once more, to molest the Israelites, they were entirely discomfited by a miraculous storm, at the prayer of Samuel, ver. 10. Salien (the year of the world 2960) allows, that this took place in the twentieth year since the ark came to Cariathiarim, in which year Samuel appointed his children judges at Bersabee, though he continued to act, and was judge for twenty-three years, (some say thirty-eight) and even under the reign of Saul had almost an absolute sway, as the prophet of the Lord. (Haydock) --- <i>Rested:</i> continued steadfast, (Santius) "cried unto," (Pagnin) "Looked (Haydock) <i>or</i> returned," Septuagint. "Lamented after the Lord," Hebrew.

(Lyranus) --- <i>Astaroth.</i> These were the principal idols of the country, (Salien; Judges ii. 11.) under which all the others were included. (Menochius) --- <i>Prepare.</i> God lays this injunction upon us, to remind us of our liberty, and we beg that he would convert us, acknowledging the necessity of his grace.

(Sanctius) (Tirinus) --- Water was also the most ancient species of libation, before honey, and afterwards wine were adopted. (Porphyrius) --- Though the law did not prescribe it, there was no prohibition. On the last day of the feast of tabernacles, the people went to the pool of Silo to fetch water, and to pour it out in the temple, as a libation to the Lord; and it is thought that Jesus Christ alludes to this custom, John vii. 24.

(Haydock) --- The sacred penman speaks with great modesty of this victory, which is nevertheless one of the most important recorded in Scripture. The Philistines could not recover themselves for 20 years; they found it necessary to restore the cities which they had taken, (Calmet) to relinquish the tribute, and to come to such conditions as Samuel imposed upon them. He suffered them, however, to keep possession of some strong holds, such as Gabaa, from which they were expelled by Jonathan. Salien says in the 22d year of Samuel, and the last of Achitob, the high priest, in the year of the world 2961.'

The life of Samuel, on this supposition, will not much exceed sixty, and he must have come into power in early life, chap. xii. 2.

      v:003:
        - "1SA:8:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Judgment.</i> Samuel was not to blame, and hence he was not punished like Heli. (Menochius) --- However, the misconduct of the children of these two judges, in succession, (Haydock) gave occasion to the people to demand a king, who might not be tempted by bribes. (Worthington) --- It is surprising that most of the great men who are mentioned in history, had degenerate children. (Calmet) --- Such were some of David's sons, as well as Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, &c. (Haydock) --- Was it because their fathers were too much taken up with the affairs of state, to watch over the education of their children? or rather, because these young men confided too much on the merits of their family, and took no pains to tread in the footsteps of their parents? (Calmet) --- \"We have here, says Josephus, a manifest proof that children do not always resemble their parents, but sometimes good men spring from the wicked; and on the contrary, the virtuous have an evil progeny.\""
      v:005:
        - '1SA:8:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Judge us,</i> in a different manner from what had been hitherto done. (Haydock) --- By a crying ingratitude, they reject the government of a wise old man, who had rendered them the most signal services. Perhaps the power of Naas, king of the Ammonites, might afford them some pretext for acting as they did. (Calmet) --- <i>As all,</i> &c. They seem to prefer the dominion of kings, who ruled over the surrounding barbarous nations as they thought proper, (Haydock) before one who should be tied down to observe the laws, prescribed by God, (Menochius) in case the Israelites should wish to have a king, Deuteronomy xvii. (Haydock) --- In the East, monarchy was the most ancient form of government. (Tacitus, Hist. iv.; Just. i.) "Principio, imperium penes Reges erat."'
      v:006:
        - '1SA:8:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Samuel.</i> Nothing could be more disrespectful to him, nor more ungrateful to God, who had distinguished them from all other nations, and had taken the government upon himself, and appointed the judges as his lieutenants. The foolish Israelites wished to throw off this sweet yoke, and to be ruled in an arbitrary manner, like the infidels, as if God could not otherwise protect them from their enemies. --- <i>Lord.</i> Josephus says that he passed the night without food or sleep, and the Lord appeared to him. The will or petition "of the people, filled Samuel with great uneasiness, who on account of his innate justice, did not like the regal power, as being too exorbitant. He rather approved of an aristocracy, as more conducive to the welfare of the people." (Antiquities vi. 4.) He means such an aristocracy as the Israelites had been accustomed to, under the guidance of men divinely commissioned, whence he elsewhere very properly styles it a <i>theocracy,</i> or "the government of God." (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - '1SA:8:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Thee.</i> "God, in anger, grants a person what he desires wrongfully." (St. Augustine) --- He permits the people to follow their own plans; and the Hebrews believe, that he gave them Saul to punish them, being well apprised of his proud and cruel nature. (Cuneus Rep.) (Calmet) --- <i>Rejected,</i> &c. The government of Israel hitherto had been a theocracy: in which God himself immediately ruled, by laws which he had enacted, and by judges extraordinarily raised up by himself: and therefore he complains that his people rejected him, in desiring a change of government, (Challoner) and wishing to appoint their own magistrates. The priests and judges had been commissioned by God, Exodus xix., and Deuteronomy xvii. (Worthington)'
      v:008:
        - "1SA:8:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Thee.</i> He comforts Samuel, by observing that it was not so much any fault of his, as the people's habitual fickle temper, which made them seek for this change. (Menochius)"

        - "1SA:8:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>The right.</i> That is, the <i>manner</i> (<i>mishpat</i>) after which he shall proceed, having no one to control him, when he has the power in his hands. (Challoner) --- He intimates that the kings will frequently act in a tyrannical manner, ver. 11. (Menochius) --- But the holy Fathers observe, that herein they do what is unjust, and contrary to God's law. St. Gregory remarks, that Achab is punished for taking the vineyard of Naboth, (3 Kings xxi.) while David will not take a piece of ground belonging to Ornan, even for an altar, without first paying a just price for it, 1 Paralipomenon xxi. 25. Some of these <i>rights</i> or customs are prohibited to the <i>king,</i> Deuteronomy xvii. 16. It is true, kings enjoy great prerogatives above judges, but never contrary to the law. They cannot take their subjects' goods: but the latter are bound to contribute to the maintenance of government; and, if they refuse, may be compelled. If kings should be guilty of excesses, \"yet them are not to be deposed by the people,....but must be tolerated with patience, peace, and meekness, till God, by his sovereign authority, left in his Church, dispose of them, which his divine wisdom and goodness often deferred to do, as here he expressly forewarneth, (ver. 18) because he will punish the sins of the people by suffering evil princes to reign,\" Job xxxiv. 30. (Conc. Later. c. iii. de hœret.[Fourth Lateran Council, constitution iii., On Heretics?]) (Worthington) See St. Thomas Aquinas, 2. 2. q. 12. a. 2. --- We may here also remark, that the people petitioned for a king, yet God made the choice; and, when he proved rebellious, selected another by the hand of Samuel, though he permitted the former to enjoy his dignity till death, chap. xiii., and xxxi. (Haydock) --- Grotius (Jur. i. 1., and 4.) maintains that Samuel here proposes the just rights of the king, and that the prince has a greater right to any one's personal property, for the public good, than he has himself. In effect, the eastern kings regarded their subjects as slaves. But those who governed the Hebrews were to follow a different conduct; and Samuel is so far from approving of what some of them would do, that he mentions their tyranny, in order to dissuade the people from what they so inconsiderately requested. (Calmet) --- The misconduct of rulers, is one of the most trying inconveniences to which a nation can be exposed. In such circumstances, \"bear, says a pagan historian, (Haydock) with the luxury and avarice of those who hold dominion, as with other natural evils. There will be vices as long as men subsist, but neither will these continue for ever, and they are compensated by the intervention of better things or men.\" <i>Meliorum interventu pensantur.</i> (Tacitus) --- Grotius at last seems to conclude, (Sup. c. iv. p. 97) that the right of the king here specified is only apparent, in as much as it includes \"the obligation of making no resistance.\" (Haydock)"

      v:012:
        - '1SA:8:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Centurions,</i> or body-guards. (Menochius) --- These offices might be honourable, but at the same time disagreeable, when people were forced to accept of them, and to neglect their more pleasing agricultural employment. The multitude of officers increases the expenses of the prince, and falls heavy upon the people. (Calmet)'

      v:015:
        - '1SA:8:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Tenth.</i> God had already claimed one tithe, which he had abandoned to his sacred ministers. We do not read that the kings of the Hebrews ever claimed (Calmet) a second tithe precisely, (Haydock) though they might have done it by the example of other kings, Leviticus xxvii. 30. Joseph had asserted the fifth part of the revenues of Egypt for its monarchs, Genesis xlvii. 26. --- <i>Eunuchs.</i> Hebrew <i>saris,</i> denotes an officer of the court. It was not lawful for the Israelites to make any eunuchs, but they might employ foreigners.'
      v:016:

      v:017:
        - '1SA:8:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Servants,</i> or slaves. The Hebrews enjoyed greater liberty than any of the nations in the East, yet they are styled slaves, chap. xvii. 8. They were nearly on the same footing as the ancient Germans. "Each governed in his own place of abode. The Lord requires of them a quantity of corn, cattle, or clothing, and so far the slave obeys;" <i>servus hactenus paret.</i> (Tacitus, Germ.) The Hebrews were also bound to follow the king to battle. The Egyptians, Persians, &c., were under greater oppression. Herodotus (iii. 31,) informs us, that when Cambyses designed to marry his own sister, his counsellors replied, that they found no express law to this effect; but there was another, "that the king of Persia may do whatever he please." The highest officers, and even his brothers, were styled, "slaves, {GREEK:START Douloi}Δουλοι{GREEK:END}, of the great king." (Aristotle, Mund.)'
      v:018:
        - '1SA:8:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>The face,</i> privately; for even groans will not be free. (Menochius) --- The event justified this prediction, as most of the kings of the Hebrews ruled like tyrants, and what was worse, engaged their subjects in idolatry, and drew down the heaviest judgments upon them. (Calmet) --- <i>Hear you,</i> so as to deliver you from oppression, though he is always willing to hear those who truly repent. (Worthington)'

What extravagance! for a people to abandon a state of happiness, and the dominion of God, and to prefer the service of a man! (Calmet) --- <i>For us.</i> This was the pretext, as Naas threatened them with war, chap. xii. 12. (Menochius)'

        - '1SA:9:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>What.</i> Were they uninformed of the disinterestedness of Samuel? or did they think that he would sell his oracles? By no means. But the manners of the ancients were very different from ours, and people chose to shew their respect for God, the king, prophets, &c., by making them some present. People still never go to visit one another in Syria without something of the kind, as it would be deemed uncivil or cruel to act otherwise. See 3 Kings xiv. 1., and Micheas iii. 11. --- <i>Bread.</i> They would have made a present of some. Saul received two loaves, chap. x. 4. See chap. xvi. 20. Hence we may form some idea of the beautiful simplicity of those ages. People were then forced to carry their own provisions, as there were no inns which supplied any. (Calmet) --- <i>Present.</i> <i>Sportula</i> means a little basket. (Haydock) --- But here it is taken for a present, as meat was commonly given. (Menochius) --- Cyrus sent his friends geese half eaten, from his own table, for greater distinction. (Xenophon) (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "what have we?" Syriac, "we have none of our provisions left."

      v:012:
        - '1SA:9:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>A sacrifice.</i> The law did not allow of sacrifices in any other place, but at the tabernacle, or temple, in which the ark of the covenant was kept; but Samuel, by divine dispensation, offered sacrifices in other places. For which dispensation this reason may be alleged, that the house of God in Silo, having lost the ark, was now cast off; as a figure of the reprobation of the Jews, Psalm lxxvii. 60, 67. And in Cariathiarim, where the ark was, there was neither tabernacle, nor altar. (Challoner) --- At least that of Moses was in the tabernacle. See chap. vi. 21. (Haydock) --- Samuel was just come up to the city, from a place called Naiot, where he instructed some of the prophets, chap. xix. 19. The maids point him out to Saul; and God, at the same time, reveals to his prophet, that the person who addressed him should be king. (Calmet) --- <i>The high place. Excelsum.</i> The <i>excelsa,</i> or <i>high places,</i> so often mentioned in Scripture, were places of worship, in which were altars for sacrifice. These were sometimes employed in the service of the true God, as in the present case: but more frequently in the service of idols, and were called <i>Excelsa,</i> which is commonly (though perhaps not so accurately) rendered <i>high places;</i> not because they were always upon hills, for the very worst of all, which was that of <i>Topheth,</i> or <i>Geennom,</i> (Jeremias xix.) was in a valley; but because of the <i>high altars,</i> and <i>pillars,</i> or <i>monuments</i> erected there, on which were set up the idols, or images of their deities; (Challoner) so that they might be called "the high things." (Haydock) --- Before Solomon built the temple, from the time that the tabernacle was deprived of the honour of having the ark, people immolated on such heights, 3 Kings iii. 2. (Menochius) --- On one of these, at Ramatha, Samuel was going to offer a peace-offering, and to feast with the heads of the city, (Calmet) or perhaps of the nation, who were expecting the result of his consultation of the Lord, respecting their petition of a king.

Saul gained some victories over them, and over the other enemies of his people, towards the beginning of his reign, chap. xiii., and xiv.

Nothing can be more charming than the modesty of Saul on this occasion. (Calmet) --- Happy would he have been, had he continued always to cherish the like sentiments.

Saul's servant was probably an Israelite, who had hired himself for a time. The first place, at the head of the table, was the most honourable, Luke xiv. 8. The king of Persia placed his most trusty friend at his left hand, and those of the highest dignity, in order at his right. (Cyropæd. vii., &c.) (Calmet)"

Some suppose that Samuel had this right shoulder for his portion. But he was not a priest. (Calmet) --- This part was assigned to the most eminent man at table; and Josephus calls it "the royal portion." (Menochius) --- Hebrew, "the shoulder, and what was upon it, (<i>or</i> he held it up) and set it (the whole quarter) before Saul." Aquila, &c., translate "the thigh," <i>left</i> or reserved. Septuagint, "laid by." It was then the fashion to place large pieces of meat before those who were to be most honoured, Genesis xviii. 6. (Homer, &c.) --- <i>People.</i> Hebrew, "till now it has been kept for thee, I said, I have invited the people." He insinuates that he knew of his coming, though it seemed so accidental, even when he invited the company. Septuagint, "eat, for it is placed before thee, as a memorial, by the people, cut it in pieces." (Haydock) --- As the shoulder supports a burden, so the king was reminded to maintain the interests of the commonwealth. (Menochius)'

        - '1SA:9:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>House,</i> probably giving him some instructions respecting his future dignity. --- <i>As he,</i> &c. This seems to be a second translation of the former sentence, taken from the Septuagint. It is omitted in several Latin manuscripts. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "and he went down from the Bama (perhaps "the steps" or high place, where the sacrifice and feast had been celebrated) into the city; and they made a bed for Saul, on the house top; and he lay down, (<b>26</b>) and when the day dawned, Samuel," &c. The roofs are flat in those countries, and such an airy situation would be most agreeable in such hot climates. (Haydock) --- The common people, generally, only spread a mat on the ground, and covered themselves with a sheet; to take their rest, either under a gallery, or in the open air. Homer places his strangers, with their upon the ground under the gallery, which was erected before the house. Aristophanes (in Vespis) mentions the custom of sleeping on the house top. See 2 Kings xvi. 22. (Calmet) --- Saul had not been educated with the greatest delicacy. (Menochius)'

      v:002: '1SA:9:2 | 2 | 2 | And he had a son whose name was Saul, a choice and goodly man, and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he appeared above all the people.'
      v:003: "1SA:9:3 | 3 | 3 | And the asses of Cis, Saul's father, were lost: and Cis said to his son Saul: Take one of the servants with thee, and arise, go, and seek the asses. And when they had passed through Mount Ephraim,"
      v:004: '1SA:9:4 | 4 | 4 | And through the land of Salisa, and had not found them, they passed also through the land of Salim, and they were not there: and through the land of Jemini, and found them not.'
      v:005: '1SA:9:5 | 5 | 5 | And when they were come to the land of Suph, Saul said to the servant that was with him: Come, let us return, lest perhaps my father forget the asses, and be concerned for us.'
      v:006: '1SA:9:6 | 6 | 6 | And he said to him: Behold there is a man of God in this city, a famous man: all that he saith, cometh certainly to pass. Now, therefore, let us go thither, perhaps he may tell us of our way, for which we are come.'
      v:007: '1SA:9:7 | 7 | 7 | And Saul said to his servant: Behold we will go: <i>but</i> what shall we carry to the man of God? the bread is spent in our bags: and we have no present to make to the man of God, nor any thing at all.'
      v:008: '1SA:9:8 | 8 | 8 | The servant answered Saul again, and said: Behold there is found in my hand the fourth part of a sicle of silver, let us give it to the man of God, that he may tell us our way.'
      v:009: '1SA:9:9 | 9 | 9 | Now in time past in Israel, when a man went to consult God, he spoke thus: Come, let us go to the seer. For he that is now called a prophet, in time past was called a seer.'
      v:010: '1SA:9:10 | 10 | 10 | And Saul said to his servant: Thy word is very good, come, let us go. And they went into the city, where the man of God was.'

      v:012: '1SA:9:12 | 12 | 12 | They answered and said to them: He is: behold he is before you, make haste now: for he came to-day into the city, for there is a sacrifice of the people to-day in the high place.'
      v:013: '1SA:9:13 | 13 | 13 | As soon as you come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat till he come; because he blesseth the victim, and afterwards they eat that are invited.

      v:014: '1SA:9:14 | 14 | 14 | And they went up into the city. And when they were walking in the midst of the city, behold Samuel was coming out over-against them, to go up to the high place.'

      v:021: '1SA:9:21 | 21 | 21 | And Saul answering, said: Am not I a son of Jemini of the least tribe of Israel, and my kindred the last among all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then hast thou spoken this word to me?'
      v:022: '1SA:9:22 | 22 | 22 | Then Samuel taking Saul, and his servant, brought them into the parlour, and gave them a place at the head of them that were invited. For there were about thirty men.'

        - '1SA:10:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Vial,</i> in the form of a <i>lentil.</i> (Pliny, [Natural History?] xviii. 12.) --- <i>Oil.</i> This anointing seems to have been peculiar to the kings, priests, and prophets of the Hebrews, who prefigured Jesus, the great anointed of God. (St. Augustine in Psalm xliv.) The custom was very ancient, Judges ix. 8. It is thought that those kings, who succeeded their fathers by their birth-right, and without opposition, did not receive any unction. (Calmet) --- But the silence of Scripture is no proof on this head; and the Fathers seem to be convinced that the custom subsisted till Christ appeared. (St. Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho, etc.) (Haydock) --- The Rabbins pretend that the sacred ointment was used for the kings of Juda, but not for those of Israel. It is not probable that it was used for either, Exodus xxx. 32., and 3 Kings i. 39. We read that Jehu was anointed king of Israel; (4 Kings ix. 6,) and we may suppose that common oil was used, in his regard, as well as for the other kings. The perfume or balm of Judea, does not spot the garments on which it may fall. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xii. 25.) It was poured on the head; the Rabbins say in the form of a crown, (Calmet) or cross. (Haydock) --- But this is uncertain. The ceremony has been preserved, with respect to Christian kings, who, according to Innocent I, should be anointed on the shoulders and arms, while prelates receive the unction on the head. --- <i>Kissed him,</i> out of respect, Psalm ii. 12. (Calmet) --- <i>Behold.</i> Hebrew, "Is it not because?" &c. (Haydock) --- <i>And thou....prince.</i> All this is wanting in the Hebrew, &c. But it is conformable to the Vatican Septuagint; (Calmet) the Alexandrian has "to be prince over his people, over Israel? and thou shalt rule over the people of the Lord, and shalt save it from its enemies around;" as we have explained, chap. ix. 16. (Haydock) --- Saul was anointed with <i>a small vessel,</i> to signify that his kingdom should not subsist long; and with <i>oil,</i> to remind him of mercy, light, and health to his people. (St. Gregory) (Worthington)'

(Calmet) --- Protestants, "at Zelzah." Others for some musical instrument, as if these travellers were "dancing," as the Septuagint insinuate, and playing on musical instruments, like the prophets, ver. 5. It does not appear how Saul would come near Bethlehem, in his journey from Ramatha to Gabaa, unless Ramatha lay more to the south than it is represented, which it could not do, being in the tribe of Ephraim; so that we might translate the Hebrew, "Thou wilt find two men of Zelzelach, a place near the tomb of Rachel, on the borders of Benjamin, and they," &c.'

It lay to the east of Gabaa, so that Saul might easily meet these pilgrims.

        - '1SA:10:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>The hill of God.</i> Gabaa, in which there was also at that time, a <i>high place</i> or <i>altar.</i> (Challoner) --- The prophets were not molested by the infidels, in performing their devotions, as people consecrated to the Lord, who do not meddle with war, are privileged by the consent of nations. (Grotius, Jur. iii. 11, 10) (Calmet) --- <i>Prophets.</i> These were men whose office it was to sing hymns and praises to God; for such in holy writ are called <i>prophets,</i> and their singing praises to God is called <i>prophesying.</i> See 1 Paralipomenon, alias 1 Chronicles xv. 22., and xxv. 1. Now there were in those days colleges, or schools for training up these prophets; and it seems there was one of these schools at this <i>hill of God;</i> and another at Naioth in Ramatha. See 1 Samuel [1 Kings] xix 20, 21, &c. (Challoner) --- The Jews say there were in every city of Judea congregations of this nature. They lived like monks, abstaining, for the most part, from marriage, though some had children, 4 Kings iv. 1. They had a superior at their head, to whom God frequently revealed future things. The rest were instructed how to explain the prophecies, to compose and sing canticles. Some of them were inspired, like Saul, only for a time. It is supposed that Samuel instituted these colleges, and this is the first time we find them mentioned. (Calmet) --- They were of infinite service in preserving the true religion. (Haydock)'

(Serarius) --- Others translate, "I will be at Galgal with thee, and we will offer sacrifices, for seven days."

      v:025:
        - '1SA:10:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Before the Lord.</i> It seems that the ark was therefore present. This record of Samuel is lost, so that we cannot determine what laws he prescribed on this occasion. (Calmet) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] vi. 5.) says that he wrote and read in the hearing of all, and in the presence of the king, what evils would ensue under the regal government; and deposited the writing in the tabernacle, that the truth of the prediction might be ascertained. He probably alludes to the denunciation of tyranny, which had been made [in] chap. viii., and which he says Samuel repeated on this occasion. But the prophet would also take a copy of <i>the law of the kingdom,</i> prescribed by Moses, (Deuteronomy xvii.) and deliver it to Saul, that he might make it the rule of his conduct, and not imitate the wicked customs of tyrants. (Haydock) --- The whole process of this memorable event he would also write down, (Menochius) as we read it at present in this chapter, placing it in the proper order, as a continuation of the sacred history which Moses and Josue had commenced; and like them, depositing the sacred volume beside the ark, or in the tabernacle. See Josue xxiv. 26. (Haydock)'

(Salien) --- <i>Presents,</i> in testimony of their submission. See Judges iii. 15., and 3 Kings iv. 21. The eastern kings still expect that ambassadors should bring noble presents, otherwise they deem themselves insulted. (P. Martyr.) --- Subjects dare not appear before their king, in Thrace, without some such offering. (Xenophon, Anab. vii., &c.) (Calmet) --- <i>Not.</i> He knew that the throne is established by mercy, Proverbs xx. 28. Hence he chose to pardon these discontented people after he had obtained the victory, and was even solicited to make an example of them. (Salien, the year of the world 2962) --- Severity might have alienated the minds of many, as he was hardly yet confirmed in his dignity, and the war against Ammon was threatening. (Menochius)'

(Calmet) --- <i>Fight.</i> He had threatened an invasion before, and had perhaps (Haydock) attacked some of the tribes on the east side of the Jordan, and treated them with the same cruelty as he intended for those of Jabes, which was a city of the first consequence. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] vi. 5.) --- <i>Naas,</i> "a serpent." There was a king of this country of the same name, in the days of David. The people had been quiet since Jephte had made such havoc among them, about ninety years before. (Judges xi.) (Calmet) --- <i>Covenant.</i> They were willing to pay him tribute. But it seems they had offered him some insult, which made the king resolve to punish them more severely. They make no mention of Saul, as they did not wish to let the king know of his election; (Salien) and perhaps had no great confidence in him, (Haydock) as he was not yet fully confirmed in his dignity, (Calmet) and had let a whole month pass without taking any measures for the deliverance of his country, though it was on that pretext that he was elected. (Haydock) --- They considered what had passed as of no consequence, chap. xii. 12.'

(Calmet) --- <i>Samuel.</i> Saul adds the name of the prophet, as the people had still great confidence in him, and he always acted as God's envoy.

Septuagint have 600,000 of Israel; and they agree with this author, in allowing also 70,000 to Juda alone. But this is a larger army than what came out of Egypt, and exceeds the limits of probability, unless <i>all</i> assembled, as the preceding verse seems (Haydock) to insinuate; (Menochius) and we find far greater numbers, 2 Paralipomenon xiii. 3, 17., if no (Haydock) error have there crept in.

        - "1SA:12:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Goeth,</i> as your leader, according to your request. I am like a private man, (Calmet) willing to submit to his and the people's judgment, (Haydock) though it could not be required. (Menochius) --- <i>Grey-headed.</i> This he might be at the age of sixty, which most chronologers allow him, (Haydock) as he had been at the head of affairs from his early years, in most difficult times. (Tirinus) --- <i>With you.</i> As soon as I heard of your complaints, I deprived them of their power, so that you cannot blame me for their misconduct. If they were guilty, they may stand their trial before the king. (Calmet)"

        - '1SA:12:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Anointed,</i> "Christ," as the anointing of kings prefigured that of the <i>Messias,</i> which, in Hebrew, has the same import as the word {GREEK:START christos}χριστοσ{GREEK:END} has in Greek.

(Calmet) --- Protestants, "to blind my eyes therewith." (Haydock) --- Septuagint have read <i>nálim,</i> "shoes," instead of <i>anlim.</i> (Calmet) --- "Have I taken from the hand of any one a present, to render me favourable, so much as a shoe?

        - '1SA:12:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Stand up,</i> like people cited to the bar. Having undergone his own trial with applause, Samuel shews that the people will not come off so well at the tribunal of God, whom they had treated with greater disrespect, injustice, and ingratitude than they had himself, as he convinced them by an astonishing and terrible storm. (Haydock) --- <i>Kindness.</i> Septuagint, "justice," as the same Hebrew word implies both. God had treated his people with mercy and with justice (Calmet) alternately. (Haydock)'

(Worthington) --- Others think that Jair, (Judges x. 3.; Junius, Usher,) or, according to the Septuagint, "Barac," are designated. Jair was a descendant of one Bedan, 1 Paralipomenon ii. 21. (Calmet) --- But we do not read that Jair performed any great exploit. (Haydock) --- <i>Samuel.</i> He speaks of himself as of any other man: as the interests of God were not to be betrayed by an unseasonable modesty. (Calmet) --- Josephus only specifies Jephte and Gedeon. (Haydock) --- The Israelites thought that they could dispose things better than God had done under the judges; and hence their sin is so often repeated. (St. Gregory) (Worthington)'

        - '1SA:12:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Of the Lord,</i> causing him to look upon you and treat you with indignation. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "and do not contend with the mouth," or against the orders of the Lord, which cannot fail to excite his displeasure. (Menochius) --- If you prove faithful under this new form of government, though it be less agreeable to God, he will still protect you. (Haydock)'

The usual seasons for rain are only spring and autumn. (St. Jerome in Amos iv. 7, &c.) --- <i>Thunder.</i> Literally, \"voices,\" Psalm xvii. 14. (Calmet) --- <i>See.</i> Being fully convinced by the miracle, which declares the will of God in the clearest manner. Though God was pleased thus to manifest his displeasure, at the people's assuming to themselves the right of changing the established form of government, by insisting so much upon having a king at this time, we cannot hence infer, as Paine and some late seditious writers have done, that the regal power is in itself an evil. It might be contrary to a theocracy, and still might suit the manners of some nations better than any other form. To determine precisely what sort of government is the best, would be an arduous task. We admire our own constitution; yet our ally, the prince of the Brazils, has lately forbidden any panegyric of it to be printed in his dominions. All innovations are, generally, attended with the most serious inconveniences. (Haydock)"

But the prophet alleviates their fears, and teaches them to refrain from idolatry, and he will still continue to perform his duty in praying for them, and giving them good advice. (Salien) --- The fear of God is increased by that which the people shew for his servants.'

        - '1SA:12:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Vain</i> and wicked idols. Hebrew <i>thohu,</i> full of "confusion" and disorder.'
      v:022:
        - "1SA:12:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Sake.</i> This motive often proved the salvation of Israel, Exodus xxxii. 12. The Scriptures wholly tend to impress upon our minds, a sense of our own weakness, and of God's infinite glory and perfection.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1SA:13:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Of one year.</i> That is, he was good, and like an innocent child, and for two years continued in that innocency. (Challoner) (St. Gregory) (Worthington) --- <i>Israel.</i> This verse is omitted in some copies of the Septuagint. It is extremely difficult to explain. Some translate Hebrew, "Saul was a son of one year old," &c. (Symmachus) Others, "Saul begot a son the first year of his reign, (Raban) Isboseth, who was 40 years old when his father died, after governing all that while. (Serarius) --- Syriac and Arabic, "In the first or second year of the reign of Saul....he chose," &c. Hardouin supposes that the people dated their years by his reign only so long. Some think that the Hebrew is imperfect; and an ancient interpreter has, "Saul was 30 years old, when he began," &c. (Calmet) --- The Rabbins and many commentators assert, that the reign of Saul lasted only two years. (Tirinus) --- But some of them explain this, as if he reigned alone only that term before he was rejected, when he could only be regarded as an usurper. Others, that he obtained the whole power for two years, after the death of Samuel. Usher concludes that, during the incursions of the Philistines, he could hardly be said to reign, and these commenced after he had been king two years. We might also translate, "Saul was the son of the year of his reign, (when he was confirmed at Galgal) and in the second year....he chose," &c. (Calmet) --- Perhaps the first translation, though somewhat mystical, may be the most literal, shewing that for one year Saul continued to act with the most engaging affability and moderation. But in the second he threw off the yoke, and was, in his turn, rejected by the Lord, as we shall soon behold. (Haydock) --- Scaliger seems to prefer allowing that the numeral letters have been omitted by some transcriber, and that we should read, Saul was 30 years old. This, and similar variations, he attributes to the compendious method of using numeral letters; (Kennicott) an inconvenience very frequently attending all manuscripts, both sacred and profane. (Taylor)'
      v:002:
        - "1SA:13:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Dwellings,</i> from Galgal (Salien) or from some other general assembly. (Calmet) --- These 3000 were to be the king's guards, supported at the expense of the nation, that the people might begin to feel one part of the royal prerogative. (Salien, the year before Christ 1089)"
      v:003:
        - '1SA:13:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Land.</i> As soon as the next cities had heard the alarm, they sounded the trumpet, and so the news was conveyed to the most distant parts, in a short time, Judges iii. 27. --- <i>Hebrews.</i> Probably those "on the other side" of the Jordan, who presently came to the assistance of their brethren, ver. 7. (Osiander) --- It might also be the usual beginning of a proclamation. See Daniel iii. 4. (Menochius) --- Septuagint and Aquila have <i>a</i> instead of <i>r</i>, in <i>hibrim.</i> "Let the servants (subjects) attend." (Aquila) "The slaves have rebelled," (Septuagint) meaning the Philistines, who ought to have been subject to Israel. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - '1SA:13:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Courage.</i> Hebrew, "and Israel was in abomination (stinking) with the Philistines." See Exodus v. 21. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "despised as nothing the strangers." --- <i>Were</i> should be omitted, as the verb is active, <i>clamavit,</i> in the Vulgate and Septuagint, though the Protestants have "were called," &c. They shouted with alacrity, that Saul would lead them on to battle. (Haydock) --- Osiander thinks that they "exclaimed against him," for engaging them in this new war.'
      v:005:
        - '1SA:13:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Chariots.</i> This number seems almost incredible, as the Philistines were but a contemptible nation, compared with various others which never brought so many chariots into the field. Zara, king of Ethiopia, in his army of a million men, had only 300, 2 Paralipomenon xiv. 9. Adarezer had 1000, and Sesac 1200 chariots, while Solomon could only boast of 1400. Hence the Syriac and Arabic read "3000;" and it is supposed that the Hebrew has <i>im,</i> at the end of <i>shelosh,</i> redundant. (Bochart, Capel, &c.) The number of horsemen would otherwise bear no proportion with the chariots. We must also observe, that under this name the Scripture denotes those who upon the chariots. They were drawn by two horses, and one man guided the horses, while another stood on the chariot; and in battle, eight other soldiers attended it. These remarks will tend to explain many difficult passages, in which we read of chariots being slain and hamstrung, which may be understood of the men and horses, 2 Kings viii. 4., and x. 18. In one place we read 700, and in another 7000 chariot were slain, (1 Paralipomenon xix. 18,) the latter number comprising the 10 attendants; so here, the Philistines might have 3000 chariots, which being each accompanied with ten men, might be counted as 30,000. (Calmet) --- Others think that there were 30,000 men fighting on chariots. (Lyranus; Salien) --- The Tyrians might have come to the assistance of their old friends, as chap. vii. 10. See 3 Kings iv. 26. (Menochius) --- <i>Number.</i> Josephus specifies "300,000 infantry." (Haydock) --- <i>Bethaven.</i> Many copies of the Septuagint read, "Bethoron," more probably, as Bethel must have been on the east of Machmas, which lay north of Gabaa, chap xiv. 5. (Calmet) "over-against Bethoron on the south." (Grabe) (Haydock) --- Hebrew also, "having Bethaven on the east." Bethel was called Bethaven after the schism of Jeroboam, so that this name seems to have been substituted by a later writer, (Calmet) unless it might have had both names long before, Josue xviii. 12. (Haydock) --- This is not contrary to chap. vii. 13, as the Philistines had been quiet for a long time. Hebrew <i>álom,</i> properly denotes the term of a jubilee or 50 years. (Du Hamel)'
      v:006:
        - "1SA:13:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Straitened,</i> the people form the northern provinces, and provisions being cut off, by the immense army of the Philistines. (Calmet) --- Providence was pleased to convince the people that, though they had been able to muster so large a force against the Ammonites, at so short a warning, they must not depend on the efforts of their new king. (Haydock) --- He suffered many of the army to retire, as he sent away most of Gedeon's soldiers, that the whole glory of the victory might be attributed to him. (Salien) --- <i>Dens.</i> So the Chaldean. Some explain the Hebrew, \"high places (Haydock) or towers.\" (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"ditches or holes.\" (Menochius) --- {GREEK:START Bothrois}Βοθροισ{GREEK:END}. In that country there are many spacious caverns, chap. xxiv., and Josue x. (Haydock)"
      v:007:
        - '1SA:13:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Hebrews.</i> Septuagint, "the people, who came over, (the river) crossed the Jordan." (Haydock) --- The title of Hebrews, "passengers," seems to be applied to those who lived on the east side of the river, (Calmet) though probably some others would seek for a retreat in that country, or even hide themselves in the regions of the Ammonites, out of which they had lately driven the inhabitants. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "the Hebrews passed over the Jordan, the land of," &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Afraid.</i> Septuagint in a sort of "ecstasy" of fear.'
      v:008:
        - '1SA:13:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Of Samuel.</i> Yet the prophet condemns his proceedings, either because he did not wait till the expiration of the seventh day, (Calmet; St. Ignatius, &c.; Salien) or because he ventured to offer sacrifice himself. (Lyra after Sulp. Severus, &c.) (Haydock) (Worthington) --- He had however the high priest with him; (chap. xiv. 3,) so that he might have performed this sacred function, at the request of Saul: and we do not find that the latter is accused of sacrilege. (Salien) --- The magnitude of the punishment is no proof of the nature of the transgression, as God often punishes, with great severity, sins which to us might appear venial. (Haydock) --- This is true, particularly with respect to those who first dare to transgress a positive command; (Numbers xv. 32.; Menochius) as Saul seems to have done the injunction of the prophet, chap. x. 8. The regal dignity was a gratuitous gift. (Salien) --- With a trembling heart, we must consider how he was rejected for neglecting to wait so short a time," (St. Gregory) when the circumstances seems to plead so strongly in his favour. How impenetrable are the judgments of God! and how punctually does he require his orders to be obeyed! (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - "1SA:13:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Lord,</i> by sacrifices. --- <i>Holocaust.</i> Hebrew, \"I forced myself therefore,\" &c. It is asked whether Saul offered sacrifice, or caused it to be offered by the priests. The text seems to assert that he did it himself. Samuel and David did the like; and we read that Solomon ascended to the brazen altar, at Gabaon, for the same purpose, 2 Paralipomenon i. 5. If it was lawful to erect altars out of the tabernacle, notwithstanding the divine prohibition, why might not individuals also offer sacrifice on certain solemn occasions? The Hebrew kings seem to have exercised some of the sacerdotal functions, particularly before the building of the temple; for afterwards we find one of their kings severely punished for presuming to offer incense, 4 Kings xv. 5. (Calmet) --- Yet the proofs that they ever lawfully offered sacrifice, are not very satisfactory, as, in the Scripture language, a person is often said to do what he enjoins another to perform on his account; and if some prophets have acted in the character of priests, by divine dispensation, we need not extend the privilege to all who have dared to assume the like prerogative. The law is clear. It is the duty of all who do not regulate their conduct by it, to know that they have God's approbation. Their expressing no scruple on the occasion, proves nothing, no more than the sacred writer's omitting to stigmatize their proceedings. But here, if Saul really offered the holocaust, the words of Samuel, <i>Thou hast done foolishly,</i> convey a sufficient reproach: but if he did not, we must suppose that he blames the neglect of waiting the full term of days. (Haydock)"
      v:013:
        - "1SA:13:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Ever.</i> He foresaw this want of obedience, and therefore promised the sceptre to Juda, Genesis xlix. (Menochius) --- God's foresight of sin, and preordination to punish it, does not take away free-will nor the possibility of a reward. (St. Augustine) (Worthington)"
      v:014:
        - '1SA:13:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Continue</i> long. This seems to have been a threat, which Saul might still have escaped, if he had not proved disobedient again. St. Gregory says, "he might have been loosed from the bonds of his former disobedience;" <i>prioris inobedientiæ nexus enodaret.</i> The second rebellion caused him to be entirely rejected, and the prophet was ordered to go and anoint David, chap. xv. (Salien)'
      v:015:
        - '1SA:13:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Samuel.</i> Piscator suspects that we ought to read <i>Saul,</i> as no mention is made of the prophet in the sequel of this war, and he is never consulted. (Calmet) --- Josephus says he returned home. (Haydock) --- But all the versions are conformable to the text: and Samuel went with the king and his 600 soldiers, to Gabaa, (Calmet) that he might not appear to retain any ill-will towards Saul, and that his followers might not be quite dispirited, as they knew that he had the thunderbolts of heaven in his hand; and if he was with them, they had nothing to fear from the myriads of their opponents. His presence was very seasonable, for they had to cut their way through the enemy. (Salien) --- <i>And the....Benjamin.</i> All this is omitted in Hebrew, Chaldean, and in many Greek and Latin copies.

(Tirinus) --- Josephus extends this species of servitude only to the neighbourhood of Gabaa, and says the major part of Saul's 600 men \"was destitute of arms, because that country had neither iron nor people to make arms.\" The immense army which had so lately discomfited the Ammonites, was surely not without weapons.

Furious battles have been also fought with sharpened stakes, burnt at the end, (Virgil, Æneid vii.) and with various implements of husbandry, of which the Hebrews were not deprived. In the defeat of Sisara, they had not a buckler nor a lance among 40,000 (Judges v. 8.; Calmet) as the Philistines had already begun to deprive the Israelites of such weapons.

      v:003: '1SA:13:3 | 3 | 3 | And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines which was in Gabaa. And when the Philistines had heard of it, Saul sounded the trumpet over all the land, saying: Let the Hebrews hear.'
      v:004: '1SA:13:4 | 4 | 4 | And all Israel heard this report: Saul hath smitten the garrison of the Philistines: and Israel took courage against the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Galgal.'
      v:005: '1SA:13:5 | 5 | 5 | The Philistines also were assembled to fight against Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and a multitude of people besides, like the sand on the sea-shore for number. And going up they camped in Machmas, at the east of Bethaven.'
      v:006: '1SA:13:6 | 6 | 6 | And when the men of Israel saw that they were straitened (for the people were distressed), they hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in dens, and in pits.'
      v:007: '1SA:13:7 | 7 | 7 | And <i>some of</i> the Hebrews passed over the Jordan into the land of Gad and Galaad. And when Saul was yet in Galgal, all the people that followed him were greatly afraid.'

      v:011: '1SA:13:11 | 11 | 11 | And Samuel said to him: What hast thou done? Saul answered: Because I saw that the people slipt from me, and thou wast not come according to the days appointed, and the Philistines were gathered together in Machmas,'
      v:012: '1SA:13:12 | 12 | 12 | I said: Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Galgal, and I have not appeased the face of the Lord. Forced by necessity, I offered the holocaust.'

(Calmet) --- <i>It may.</i> Literally, \"if perchance.\" (Haydock) --- This does not express any doubt. The hero found himself impelled to undertake this work, but he knew not by what means God would crown it with success. He therefore prays to him in this manner, as Abraham's servant had done, Genesis xxiv. 12. He does not tempt God no more than Gedeon and Moses, who begged that the Lord would manifest his will by miracles.

Louis de Dieu rejects all the other versions, and would translate the Hebrew \"in almost the half of the length of a furrow, and in the breadth which is between two furrows in a field,\" so that the enemy would be very close together. Literally, \"almost in the half of a furrow of a yoke of the field,\" which seems rather to be understood of the length, (Calmet) if indeed it have any meaning. Protestants are forced to help out the text: \"within as it were a half acre of land, <i>which</i> a yoke <i>of oxen might plough.</i>\" (Haydock) --- But a whole acre was the usual allowance. (Menochius) --- Hallet observes, \"the Septuagint read the Hebrew in a different manner, and have rendered the verse thus, 'That first slaughter was....of about twenty men, with darts, and stones, and flints of the field:' I suppose the read, <i>Bétsim ubomáuth.\"</i> Kennicott adds, and <i>ubgomri,</i> as the Arabs still use <i>gomor,</i> to denote \"a small flint.\" (Golius) (Haydock)"

Nem.) The earth quaked (Calmet) to increase the enemies' apprehensions, so that those who had gone out to plunder, hearing of the disaster, which report had greatly magnified, and all the people feeling this unusual and alarming motion of the earth, perceived that God was fighting against them, and trembled.

He saw not that he was acting against his own interest. The sequel does not evince that God approved of his conduct. But the people were to be taught not to make light of oaths, nor to neglect the curses which their rulers should denounce. (Calmet) --- <i>Food.</i> Literally, "bread," which comprises all sorts of food, honey, &c., (ver. 25.; Haydock) but not drink, which might lawfully have been taken, as thirst is more difficult to bear. (Menochius) --- Salien (the year of the world 2964) defends the conduct of Saul, and condemns Jonathan.'

(Maundrell) --- The people use honey almost in every sauce and in every repast. Virgin assures us, that "bees dwell in holes under ground, in hollow stones, and trees." (Georg. iv.) The Scripture frequently mentions honey flowing, Exodus ii. 8., Psalm lxx. 17., and Job xx. 17.{JOIN}{BQ:1}<i>Mella fluant illi, ferat & rubus asper amomum.</i> (Virgil, Ec. iii.){JOIN}Sanctius says, that in Spain, streams of honey may be seen on the ground; and Maldonet observes, that the countrymen get a livelihood by gathering it from the trees in Betica, or Andalusia.'

      v:042:
        - '1SA:14:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>Jonathan was taken.</i> Though Jonathan was excused from sin, through ignorance of the prohibition, yet God was pleased on this occasion to let the lot fall upon him, to shew to all, the great obligation of obedience to princes and parents, (Challoner) the sacred nature of an oath, and at the same time to give Saul a warning not to swear rashly. (Calmet) --- How must he have been afflicted, when he saw that he had brought his beloved son into such danger! (Menochius)'
      v:044:
        - '1SA:14:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>Die.</i> We may here admire the respect which the ancients had for an oath, without seeking for any modification; and the blindness of Saul, who condemns his son with as much haste as he had pronounced the curse, thinking thus to honour God. The thing surely required some deliberation, and he ought to have consulted the Lord about it. The action of Jonathan was not criminal, and the former silence of God did not prove that he deserved death. (Calmet) --- If it had, the people would never have been able to have rescued him, no more than the unhappy Achan, Josue vii. (Haydock) --- If Saul had been more enlightened, and more humble, he would have concluded that God was displeased at him, and not at Jonathan.

    verses:
      v:001: '1SA:14:1 | 1 | 1 | Now it came to pass one day that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man that bore his armour: Come, and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines, which is on the other side of yonder place. But he told not this to his father.'
      v:002: '1SA:14:2 | 2 | 2 | And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gabaa, under the pomegranate-tree, which was in Magron: and the people with him were about six hundred men.'
      v:003: '1SA:14:3 | 3 | 3 | And Achias, the son of Achitob, brother to Ichabod, the son of Phinees, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}the son of Heli, the priest of the Lord in Silo, wore the ephod. And the people knew not whither Jonathan was gone.'
      v:004: '1SA:14:4 | 4 | 4 | Now there were between the ascents, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of the Philistines, rocks standing up on both sides, and steep cliffs like teeth on the one side, and on the other, the name of the one was Boses, and the name of the other was Sene:'
      v:005: '1SA:14:5 | 5 | 5 | One rock stood out toward the north, over-against Machmas, and the other to the south, over-against Gabaa.'
      v:006: '1SA:14:6 | 6 | 6 | And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour: Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised, it may be the Lord will do for us: because it is easy for the Lord to save either by many, or by few.'
      v:007: '1SA:14:7 | 7 | 7 | And his armour-bearer said to him: Do all that pleaseth thy mind: go whither thou wilt, and I will be with thee wheresoever thou hast a mind.'
      v:008: '1SA:14:8 | 8 | 8 | And Jonathan said: Behold we will go over to these men. And when we shall be seen by them,'
      v:009: '1SA:14:9 | 9 | 9 | If they shall speak thus to us: Stay till we come to you: let us stand still in our place, and not go up to them.'
      v:010: '1SA:14:10 | 10 | 10 | But if they shall say: Come up to us: let us go up, because the Lord hath delivered them into our hands, this shall be a sign unto us.'
      v:011: '1SA:14:11 | 11 | 11 | So both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said: Behold the Hebrews come forth out of the holes wherein they were hid.'
      v:012: '1SA:14:12 | 12 | 12 | And the men of the garrison spoke to Jonathan, and to his armour-bearer, and said: Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armour-bearer: Let us go up, follow me: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}for the Lord hath delivered them into the hands of Israel.'
      v:013: '1SA:14:13 | 13 | 13 | And Jonathan went up creeping on his hands and feet, and his armour-bearer after him. And some fell before Jonathan, others his armour-bearer slew as he followed him.'
      v:014: '1SA:14:14 | 14 | 14 | And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his armour-bearer made, was of about twenty men, within half an acre of land, which a yoke of oxen is wont to plough in a day.'
      v:015: '1SA:14:15 | 15 | 15 | And there was a miracle in the camp, in the fields: and all the people of their garrison, who had gone out to plunder, were amazed, and the earth trembled: and it happened as a miracle from God.'
      v:016: '1SA:14:16 | 16 | 16 | And the watchmen of Saul, who were in Gabaa of Benjamin looked, and behold a multitude overthrown, and fleeing this way and that.'
      v:017: '1SA:14:17 | 17 | 17 | And Saul said to the people that were with him: Look, and see who is gone from us. And when they had sought, it was found that Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there.'
      v:018: '1SA:14:18 | 18 | 18 | And Saul said to Achias: Bring the ark of the Lord. (For the ark of God was there that day with the children of Israel.)'
      v:019: '1SA:14:19 | 19 | 19 | And while Saul spoke to the priest, there arose a great uproar in the camp of the Philistines: and it increased by degrees, and was heard more clearly. And Saul said to the priest: Draw in thy hand.'
      v:020: "1SA:14:20 | 20 | 20 | Then Saul, and all the people that were with him, shouted together, and they came to the place of the fight: and behold every man's sword was turned upon his neighbour, and there was a very great slaughter."
      v:021: '1SA:14:21 | 21 | 21 | Moreover, the Hebrews that had been with the Philistines yesterday and the day before, and went up with them into the camp, returned to be with the Israelites, who were with Saul and Jonathan.'
      v:022: '1SA:14:22 | 22 | 22 | And all the Israelites that had hid themselves in Mount Ephraim, hearing that the Philistines fled, joined themselves with their countrymen in the fight. And there were with Saul about ten thousand men.'
      v:023: 1SA:14:23 | 23 | 23 | And the Lord saved Israel that day. And the fight went on as far as Bethaven.
      v:024: '1SA:14:24 | 24 | 24 | And the men of Israel were joined together that day: and Saul adjured the people, saying: Cursed be the man that shall eat food till evening, till I be revenged of my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.'
      v:025: '1SA:14:25 | 25 | 25 | And all the common people came into a forest, in which there was honey upon the ground.'
      v:026: '1SA:14:26 | 26 | 26 | And when the people came into the forest, behold the honey dropped, but no man put his hand to his mouth. For the people feared the oath.'
      v:027: '1SA:14:27 | 27 | 27 | But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people: and he put forth the end of the rod, which he had in his hand, and dipt it in a honey-comb: and he carried his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were enlightened.'
      v:028: '1SA:14:28 | 28 | 28 | And one of the people answering, said: Thy father hath bound the people with an oath, saying: Cursed be the man that shall eat any food this day. (And the people were faint.)'
      v:029: '1SA:14:29 | 29 | 29 | And Jonathan said: My father hath troubled the land: you have seen yourselves that my eyes are enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey:'
      v:030: '1SA:14:30 | 30 | 30 | How much more if the people had eaten of the prey of their enemies, which they found? had there not been made a greater slaughter among the Philistines?'
      v:031: 1SA:14:31 | 31 | 31 | So they smote that day the Philistines from Machmas to Aialon. And the people were wearied exceedingly.
      v:032: '1SA:14:32 | 32 | 32 | And falling upon the spoils, they took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people ate them with the blood.'
      v:033: '1SA:14:33 | 33 | 33 | And they told Saul that the people had sinned against the Lord, eating with the blood. And he said: You have transgressed: roll here to me now a great stone.'
      v:034: '1SA:14:34 | 34 | 34 | And Saul said: Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them to bring me every man his ox and his ram, and slay them upon this stone, and eat, and you shall not sin against the Lord, in eating with the blood. So all the people brought every man his ox with him till the night: and slew them there.'
      v:035: '1SA:14:35 | 35 | 35 | And Saul built an altar to the Lord: and he then first began to build an altar to the Lord.'
      v:036: '1SA:14:36 | 36 | 36 | And Saul said: Let us fall upon the Philistines by night, and destroy them till the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And the people said: Do all that seemeth good in thy eyes. And the priest said: Let us draw near hither unto God.'
      v:037: '1SA:14:37 | 37 | 37 | And Saul consulted the Lord: Shall I pursue after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hands of Israel? And he answered him not that day.'
      v:038: '1SA:14:38 | 38 | 38 | And Saul said: Bring hither all the corners of the people: and know, and see by whom this sin hath happened to-day.'
      v:039: '1SA:14:39 | 39 | 39 | As the Lord liveth, who is the Saviour of Israel, if it was done by Jonathan, my son, he shall surely die. In this none of the people gainsayed him.'
      v:040: '1SA:14:40 | 40 | 40 | And he said to all Israel: Be you on one side and I, with Jonathan, my son, will be on the other side. And the people answered Saul: Do what seemeth good in thy eyes.'
      v:041: '1SA:14:41 | 41 | 41 | And Saul said to the Lord: O Lord God of Israel, give a sign, by <i>which we may know</i>, what the meaning is, that thou answerest not thy servant to-day: If this iniquity be in me, or in my son Jonathan, give a proof: or if this iniquity be in thy people, give holiness. And Jonathan and Saul were taken, and the people escaped.'
      v:042: '1SA:14:42 | 42 | 42 | And Saul said: Cast lots between me, and Jonathan, my son. And Jonathan was taken.'
      v:043: '1SA:14:43 | 43 | 43 | And Saul said to Jonathan: Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said: I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod, which was in my hand, and behold I <i>must</i> die.'
      v:044: '1SA:14:44 | 44 | 44 | And Saul said: May God do so and so to me, and add still more: for dying thou shalt die, O Jonathan.'
      v:045: '1SA:14:45 | 45 | 45 | And the people said to Saul: Shall Jonathan then die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? this must not be: As the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people delivered Jonathan, that he should not die.'
      v:046: '1SA:14:46 | 46 | 46 | And Saul went back, and did not pursue after the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own places.'
      v:047: '1SA:14:47 | 47 | 47 | And Saul having his kingdom established over Israel, fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and Edom, and the kings of Soba, and the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he overcame.'
      v:048: '1SA:14:48 | 48 | 48 | And gathering together an army, he defeated Amalec, and delivered Israel from the hand of them that spoiled them.'
      v:049: '1SA:14:49 | 49 | 49 | And the sons of Saul, were Jonathan, and Jessui, and Melchisua: and the names of his two daughters, the name of the first-born <i>was</i> Merob, and the name of the younger Michol.'
      v:050: "1SA:14:50 | 50 | 50 | And the name of Saul's wife, was Achinoam, the daughter of Achimaas; and the name of the captain of his army was Abner, the son of Ner, the cousin-german of Saul."
      v:051: '1SA:14:51 | 51 | 51 | For Cis was the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, was son of Abiel.'
      v:052: '1SA:14:52 | 52 | 52 | And there was a great war against the Philistines all the days of Saul. For whomsoever Saul saw to be a valiant man, and fit for war, he took him to himself.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1SA:15:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Lord,</i> in gratitude for so great an honour. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - "1SA:15:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Reckoned up.</i> God speaks in a human manner, as if he had been reading the history of ancient times, Exodus xvii. 14. (Menochius) --- The Amalecites had treated Israel with inhumanity, above 400 years before. God's vengeance is often slow, but only so much the more terrible. (Calmet) --- Hebrew <i>pakadti,</i> I have visited, or will punish and remember."
      v:003:
        - "1SA:15:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Destroy,</i> as a thing accursed. (Haydock) --- <i>Child.</i> The great master of life and death (who cuts off one half of mankind whilst they are children) has been pleased sometimes to ordain that children should be put to the sword, in detestation of the crimes of their parents, and that they might not live to follow the same wicked ways. But without such ordinance of God, it is not allowable in any wars, how just soever, to kill children. (Challoner) --- The Israelites were now to execute God's orders with blind obedience, as he cannot be guilty of injustice. --- <i>Nor covet....his,</i> is omitted in Hebrew, &c. (Calmet) --- Amalec is stricken when the flesh is chastised---He is destroyed when we repress evil thoughts. (St. Gregory) (Worthington)"
      v:004:
        - '1SA:15:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>As lambs.</i> This comparison is very common, Isaias xl. 11., and Ezechiel xxxiv. 2. But many translate the Hebrew "in Telaim." St. Jerome reads Hebrew c, <i>as,</i> instead of b, <i>in,</i> with greater propriety. Septuagint and Josephus, "in Galgal," which in effect would have been the most proper place for rendezvous. (Calmet) --- <i>Footmen.</i> Vatican Septuagint, "400,000 ranks <i>or</i> standards, (Josephus, men) and Juda 30,000."'
      v:005:
        - '1SA:15:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Amelac.</i> The people dwelt in tents, and removed from one place to another. So in Ethiopia there are properly no cities, the place where the prince encamps is deemed the capital. (Calmet) --- <i>Torrent.</i> Hebrew, or "valley."'
      v:006:
        - '1SA:15:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Egypt.</i> See Judges i. 16., Exodus xviii. 12., and Numbers x. 31., and xxiv. 21. Saul gave private instructions to the Cinite, who had been settled at Arad, and had mixed with Amalec, to depart. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - '1SA:15:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Sur.</i> See Genesis ii. 11., and xvi. 7., and xxv. 18., and Exodus xv. 22. (Menochius) --- These people had occupied a great part of the country, from the Persian Gulf to Egypt. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - '1SA:15:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Garments.</i> Hebrew is commonly rendered, "fatlings." Septuagint, "eatables." (Calmet) --- Avarice seems to have actuated Saul, (Lyranus) or a false pity, (Josephus) or a desire to grace his triumph, ver. 12. (Glossa.) (Menochius)'
      v:011:
        - '1SA:15:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Repenteth.</i> God cannot change: but he often acts exteriorly as one who repents. He alters his conduct when men prove rebellious. (St. Justin Martyr, p. 22.) --- <i>Grieved.</i> Hebrew, "indignant." (Calmet) --- He was sorry to think that Saul would now lose his temporal, and perhaps his eternal crown. (Salien) --- "The choice of Judas and of Saul, do not prove that God is ignorant of future events, but rather that he is a Judge of the present." (St. Jerome in Ezechiel ii.)'
      v:012:
        - '1SA:15:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Arch.</i> Here we behold what a change prosperity makes in the manners of those who before shewed the greatest humility. Saul erects a monument to his own vanity. Hebrew, "he has set him up a hand," (as Absalom did, 2 Kings xviii. 18.) or "a place" to divide the booty, (Jonathan) or "a garrison," to keep the country in subjection. (Calmet) --- Perhaps he erected the figure of "a hand," as an emblem of strength, and in honour of Benjamin, "the son of the right hand," of whose tribe he was. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - "1SA:15:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Hear,</i> and which manifestly prove, that God's order has not been put in execution. (Menochius)"
      v:015:
        - '1SA:15:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Thy God.</i> This was probably a falsehood, like the rest. (Salien)'
      v:017:
        - '1SA:15:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Eyes.</i> God rejects the proud, and <i>gives</i> his <i>grace to the humble.</i> See Luke i. 52. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - '1SA:15:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Lord.</i> Septuagint, "of the people."'
      v:021:
        - '1SA:15:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>First-fruits,</i> or the best. --- <i>Slain.</i> Hebrew, "of the anathema."'
      v:022:
        - '1SA:15:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Rams.</i> Can God be pleased with victims which he has cursed? (Haydock)'
      v:023:
        - "1SA:15:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Obey.</i> Hebrew, \"Rebellion is the sin of divination <i>or</i> witchcraft, and resistance is iniquity, and the Theraphim.\" Symmachus, \"the injustice of idols.\" Theraphim here designate idolatrous representations, Genesis xxxi. 19. They were probably of Chaldean origin, in honour of the sun and fire, (Calmet) and were venerated like the Penates, and supposed to be the sources of prosperity, from the Arabic <i>Taraph,</i> \"to give abundance.\" Hence Laban was so solicitous to recover what Rachel had taken away. (Louis de Dieu) --- By sacrifices we give our goods, or another's flesh is immolated; (Mor. xxxiii. 10.; Du Hamel) by obedience, we give ourselves to God. (St. Gregory) (Worthington)"
      v:024:
        - "1SA:15:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Voice:</i> miserable excuse for a king, who ought to prevent the sins of his people! (Calmet) --- Saul's transgression seems less than David's; but the one repents, and the other proudly defends what he had done. (Du Hamel)"
      v:025:
        - '1SA:15:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Bear,</i> or take away. Pardon my fault. Do not expose me in public. --- <i>The Lord,</i> by offering sacrifices, ver. 31. (Calmet)'
      v:027:
        - 1SA:15:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Rent:</i> a dreadful prognostic that Saul was cast away. (Haydock)
      v:029:
        - "1SA:15:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Triumpher.</i> Some suppose that he speaks ironically of Saul. A prince, like you, will not repent. (Calmet) --- But it more probably refers to God, who would not fail to execute his threats against the king. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, \"the victor in Israel will not lie, he will not repent.\" Septuagint, \"and Israel shall be split in two, and the holy one of Israel shall not turn nor repent.\" Saul's rejection became now inevitable. (Calmet)"
      v:030:
        - '1SA:15:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Israel.</i> He is wholly solicitous to shun disgrace in this world. (Haydock) --- His confession was not actuated by such contrition as that he might deserve to hear, <i>the Lord has removed thy sin.</i> He begins by falsehood; continues making idle excuses, and throwing the blame on others, and concludes, by shewing that he is more concerned for what his subjects may think and do against him, than for the displeasure of God. He boldly ventures to offer victims. But Samuel joins not with him in prayer, looking upon him as a person excommunicated; and he only attends that he may see the word of the Lord fulfilled, and Agag treated as he deserved. (Salien, the year of the world 2965.)'
      v:032:
        - '1SA:15:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Trembling.</i> Hebrew, "and Agag came to him delicately." Septuagint, "trembling," (Haydock) or walking with a soft step, or "with bands <i>or</i> chains;" <i>mahadannoth.</i> See Pagnin. (Menochius) --- Some think that he presented himself boldly, like a king, fearing nothing. (Vatable) --- <i>Manner.</i> Hebrew, "Surely the bitterness of death is past." I have obtained pardon from Saul. But the sense of the Vulgate seems preferable, as he must have perceived, from the looks of the prophet, that death was hanging over him. Hence others translate, "is pouring upon me," instead of, <i>is past.</i> Septuagint, "Is death thus bitter?" Chaldean, "I pray my Lord: the bitterness of death." (Haydock) --- <i>O death! how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that hath peace in his possessions,</i> &c., Ecclesiasticus xli. 1. So Aristotle (Nicom. iii. 6.) says, "Death is most terrible, ({GREEK:START peras gar}πηρασ γαρ{GREEK:END}) for it is a passage," or separation, from all the things which could attach a man to this world. (Calmet) --- This catastrophe of Agag and Saul, had been long before predicted, Numbers xxiv. 7. (Haydock)'
      v:033:
        - '1SA:15:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Pieces.</i> Josephus adds, by the hand of others. (Menochius) --- But zeal put the sword into his own hand; and he imitated the Levites and Phinees, (Exodus xxxii. 27.) to shew Saul how preposterous had been his pity, when the Lord had spoken plainly. (Calmet) --- <i>Lord,</i> as a sort of victim, Isaias xxxiv. 6. (Menochius)'
      v:035:
        - '1SA:15:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Saw Saul no more till the day of his death.</i> That is, he went no more to see him: he visited him no more. (Challoner) --- He looked upon him as one who had lost the right to the kingdom, though he was suffered for a time to hold the reins of government, as a lieutenant to David. He might afterwards see Saul passing, but never to visit him, (Salien) or to consult with him about the affairs of state; (Menochius) nor perhaps did he even see him, when Saul came to Najoth, chap. xix. 19, 24. His spirit came to announce destruction to Saul, the night preceding the death of that unfortunate king, chap. xxxviii. (Haydock) --- <i>Repented.</i> God is said, improperly, to repent when he alters what he had appointed. (St. Ambrose de Noe, chap. iv.) (Worthington)'

      v:011: '1SA:15:11 | 11 | 11 | It repenteth me that I have made Saul king: for he hath forsaken me, and hath not executed my commandments. And Samuel was grieved, and he cried unto the Lord all night.'
      v:012: '1SA:15:12 | 12 | 12 | And when Samuel rose early, to go to Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel that Saul was come to Carmel, and had erected for himself a triumphant arch, and returning had passed on, and gone down to Galgal. And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul was offering a holocaust to the Lord out of the choicest of the spoils, which he had brought from Amalec.'
      v:013: '1SA:15:13 | 13 | 13 | And when Samuel was come to Saul, Saul said to him: Blessed be thou of the Lord, I have fulfilled the word of the Lord.'
      v:014: '1SA:15:14 | 14 | 14 | And Samuel said: What meaneth then this bleating of the flocks, which soundeth in my ears, and the lowing of the herds, which I hear?'
      v:015: '1SA:15:15 | 15 | 15 | And Saul said: They have brought them from Amalec: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the herds, that they might be sacrificed to the Lord thy God, but the rest we have slain.'
      v:016: '1SA:15:16 | 16 | 16 | And Samuel said to Saul: Suffer me, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night. And he said to him: Speak.'
      v:017: '1SA:15:17 | 17 | 17 | And Samuel said: When thou wast a little one in thy own eyes, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the Lord anointed thee to be king over Israel.'
      v:018: '1SA:15:18 | 18 | 18 | And the Lord sent thee on the way, and said: Go, and kill the sinners of Amalec, and thou shalt fight against them until thou hast utterly destroyed them.'
      v:019: '1SA:15:19 | 19 | 19 | Why then didst thou not hearken to the voice of the Lord: but hast turned to the prey, and hast done evil in the eyes of the Lord?'
      v:020: '1SA:15:20 | 20 | 20 | And Saul said to Samuel: Yea, I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord, and have walked in the way by which the Lord sent me, and have brought Agag, the king of Amalec, and Amalec I have slain.'
      v:021: '1SA:15:21 | 21 | 21 | But the people took of the spoils, sheep and oxen, <i>as</i> the first-fruits of those things that were slain, to offer sacrifice to the Lord their God in Galgal.'
      v:022: '1SA:15:22 | 22 | 22 | And Samuel said: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Doth the Lord desire holocausts and victims, and not rather that the voice of the Lord should be obeyed? For obedience is better than sacrifices: and to hearken rather than to offer the fat of rams.'
      v:023: '1SA:15:23 | 23 | 23 | Because it is like the sin of witchcraft, to rebel: and like the crime of idolatry, to refuse to obey. For as much, therefore, as thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord hath <i>also</i> rejected thee from being king.'
      v:024: '1SA:15:24 | 24 | 24 | And Saul said to Samuel: I have sinned, because I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words, fearing the people, and obeying their voice.'
      v:025: '1SA:15:25 | 25 | 25 | But now bear, I beseech thee, my sin, and return with me, that I may adore the Lord.'
      v:026: '1SA:15:26 | 26 | 26 | And Samuel said to Saul: I will not return with thee, because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.'
      v:027: '1SA:15:27 | 27 | 27 | And Samuel turned about to go away: but he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.'
      v:028: '1SA:15:28 | 28 | 28 | And Samuel said to him: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to thy neighbour who is better than thee.'
      v:029: '1SA:15:29 | 29 | 29 | But the Triumpher in Israel will not spare, and will not be moved to repentance: for he is not a man that he should repent.'
      v:030: '1SA:15:30 | 30 | 30 | Then he said: I have sinned: yet honour me now before the ancients of my people, and before Israel, and return with me, that I may adore the Lord thy God.'
      v:031: '1SA:15:31 | 31 | 31 | So Samuel turned again after Saul: and Saul adored the Lord.'
      v:032: '1SA:15:32 | 32 | 32 | And Samuel said: Bring hither to me Agag, the king of Amalec. And Agag was presented to him very fat, and trembling. And Agag said: Doth bitter death separate in this manner?'
      v:033: '1SA:15:33 | 33 | 33 | And Samuel said: As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed him in pieces before the Lord in Galgal.'
      v:034: '1SA:15:34 | 34 | 34 | And Samuel departed to Ramatha: but Saul went up to his house in Gabaa.'
      v:035: '1SA:15:35 | 35 | 35 | And Samuel saw Saul no more till the day of his death: nevertheless, Samuel mourned for Saul, because the Lord repented that he had made him king over Israel.'

        - "1SA:16:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>How long.</i> It seems his tears were not soon dried up, as he lamented the fall of one whom he had formerly so much admired, and perceived what evils would ensue. (Salien) --- He had hoped that the decree might have been revokable. But God now convinces him of the contrary, by ordering him to go and anoint a successor. --- <i>Horn.</i> Such vessels were formerly very common, and were used to contain liquor, and instead of cups, 3 Kings i. 39. (Horace, ii. Sat. 2.) The ancient silver cups, at Athens, resembled horns. (Athen. xi. 7.) But the northern nations, particularly Denmark, &c., used horns to drink, as the Georgians still do. The rims are ornamented with silver, &c. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xi. 37.) (Chardin) (Calmet) --- A fragile vile was not used, but a horn, to denote the duration and abundance of David's reign.

No one doubted but that he might lawfully offer sacrifice, at a distance from the tabernacle, as he was guided by God. The Jews allow that prophets have this privilege, and may dispense with the ceremonial law, (Grotius) when they act by God's authority, as we ought to believe they do, as long as there is no proof to the contrary.

Glorified saints see man's heart in his light, for their own and our advantage, (St. Gregory, Mor. xii. 11.; St. Augustine) as the prophets have sometimes done, 3 Kings xiv. (Worthington)"

      v:013:
        - "1SA:16:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Brethren.</i> Some say, without informing him, (Calmet) or them, (Menochius) what the unction meant. If he told the brothers, he would no doubt take the necessary precautions to keep it secret, as the whole family would have been in imminent danger, if the transaction had come to the ears of Saul, ver. 2. Josephus says, that Samuel only informed Isai in private: and David's brothers treated him with no peculiar distinction. Whence it is inferred, that they had not been present when he was anointed. Some witnesses seem, however, to have been requisite, as the title of David to the regal dignity depended on this ceremony, and none were more interested than his own family to assert his pretensions. He now had a right to the kingdom, but not the possession; being like a son expecting his father's estate as his future right, of which, as yet, he cannot dispose. (Calmet) --- <i>Came upon,</i> to make him prosper. (Menochius) --- Hebrew, \"came with prosperity; (Septuagint) impetuosity.\" God endued him with all those graces which might render him fit to command. (Calmet) --- So David prays himself, \"with a princely spirit confirm me;\" (Psalm l. 14.) or, <i>strengthen me with a perfect spirit.</i> Salien observes, that he did not now receive the spirit of charity, as if he had hitherto been in enmity with God, (chap. xiii. 14.) but he began to advance in virtue with more rapid strides, while Saul became every day more criminal and abandoned to the devil. (Haydock) --- David received the spirit of fortitude and of prophecy, of which Saul had formerly had some experience, when he was first elevated to that high dignity, chap. x. He was changed into a new man, and adorned with all that could render a king most glorious. Though he returned to his wonted occupations, the spirit of the Lord enabled him to destroy wild beasts, as in play, (Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 3.) and to compose and sing many of those divine canticles [the Psalms] which we still admire. (Salien, the year of the world 2969.) --- Whether he composed all the Psalms, as St. Chrysostom endeavours to prove, (præf.) we shall examine hereafter. (Haydock)"
      v:014:
        - "1SA:16:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>From the Lord.</i> An evil spirit, by divine permission, and for his punishment, either possessed or obsessed him. (Challoner) --- We no longer behold in Saul any generous sentiments. He falls a prey to melancholy, anger, suspicion, and cruelty. \"He was seized with an illness, inflicted by the devil, says Josephus, ([Antiquities?] vi. 9.) so that he seemed to be choking; nor could the physicians discover any other means of alleviating his distress, except by employing some person skilled in music.... David alone could bring the king to his right senses, by singing hymns with the sound of the harp. Wherefore Jesse consented that his son should remain with the king, since he was so much delighted with his company.\" (Haydock) --- The Jews, and many Christians, suppose that Saul's illness was melancholy, or \"madness,\" as St. Chrysostom calls it. It was inflicted by an evil, or even by a good angel, as the minister of God's vengeance, (Exodus xi. 4.; Calmet) who punished his former pride and rebellion, by reducing him to so mean a condition. (Haydock) --- St. Augustine and Ven. Bede suppose, that the evil spirit troubled him by God's permission. (Worthington)"
      v:016:
        - '1SA:16:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Easily.</i> The effects which have been produced by music are truly surprising, if we may believe what the ancients have related. Our music may not at present be so striking, or we may keep a greater restraint upon our passions, and moderate the exterior demonstrations of our sentiments more than they did. (Calmet) --- But, in the present case, there was probably some miraculous interference. (Haydock) --- The disciples of Pythagoras lay a great stress on music, to calm the passions, (Quintil. ix. 4.; Menochius) or to rouse them. (p. 439.) (Haydock) --- It may also frequently contribute to restore health. (Gallien, &c.) See chap. x. 10., and 4 Kings iii. 15. (Calmet) --- But God made it so efficacious here, to shew the virtue of David, and the injustice of Saul. (Worthington) --- Thus, by the prayers of the Church, the devil is expelled. (Theodoret) (Tirinus)'
      v:018:
        - "1SA:16:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Him.</i> Some think that this took place before David's victory over Goliath; others believe, that David was only made armour-bearer to Saul, after that event. We must not disturb the order of the sacred historian without some cogent reason: and the courtiers might already have heard of David's prowess and virtue, of which he gave such evident proofs, after he was confirmed by the Holy Spirit, ver. 13. (Calmet)"

        - "1SA:16:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Departed from him.</i> Chased away by David's devotion. (Challoner) --- \"The melody of David's harp, as some of the Fathers remark, represents that sweet and engaging demeanour, which should distinguish the peaceful ministers of the gospel,...whether they strive to allay the rage, or dispel the fears of a troubled mind.\" (Reeves) --- Nothing can equal the divine harmony of those sublime truths which are contained in the Psalms of David, and nothing can so powerfully contribute to drive away the spirit of pride from our hearts, and awaken them to the voice of heaven. (St. Augustine) --- Some of these truths might make some passing impression even on the mind of Saul; and the devil could not bear to hear the praises of God. (Haydock)"

      v:002: '1SA:16:2 | 2 | 2 | And Samuel said: How shall I go? for Saul will hear of it, and he will kill me. And the Lord said: Thou shalt take with thee a calf of the herd, and thou shalt say: I am come to sacrifice to the Lord.'

(Cornelius a Lapide) --- His parents are no where specified, as Arapha is not, as some pretend, the name of his mother, but denotes that he was of the race of the Raphaim, 2 Kings xxi. 16. Some translate, a man who challenges to fight a duel, or one who comes into the midst as "a champion," to decide the cause of all the rest. Thus the Gaul defied the most valiant of the Romans, but was slain by M. Torquatus, Livy vii. Septuagint, "A strong man went out from the station," &c. Chaldean, "There came out from among them, out of the camp of the Philistines, a man named Goliath." But many able interpreters adhere to the Vulgate. --- <i>Span,</i> about 12½ feet, so that he was taller than two common men. Those who call in question the existence of giants, will surely have nothing to object to this formal proof from Scripture. (Calmet) --- The Vatican Septuagint and Josephus read, however, "four cubits and a span," or near eight feet. (Kennicott) --- Some reduce his height to 11 feet 3 inches, or even to 9 feet 9 inches, English. (Haydock) --- His helmet weighed 15 pounds, avoirdupois; his collar, or buckler, about 30; the head of his spear (26 feet long) weighed about 38 pounds; his sword 4; his greaves on his legs 30; and his coat of mail 156: total, 273 pounds. (Button.) (Haydock) --- Goliath wa a figure of the devil, or of any arch-heretic, who provoketh the Church of God, but is slain by the humble with his own weapons. (Worthington)'

      v:007:
        - "1SA:17:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Beam,</i> which was of a very different construction from ours. Hostius concludes, that all the armour of Goliath must have weighed 272 pounds and 13 ounces, including the buckler and spear which his armour-bearer carried before him. Plutarch allows a talent, or 60 pounds, for the usual weight of a soldier's armour. Alcimus was remarked in the army of Demetrius, for having double that weight. --- <i>Bearer.</i> Hebrew, \"one bearing a shield,\" or whose office it was to carry it, or any other part of the armour, when required. It would appear singular that the giant should have two bucklers, though David seems to specify two sorts, Psalm xxxiv. 2. This attendant might carry a large one, which would cover most part of the body, and was of service when a person had not to remove far from his place in battle. The buckler of Ajax was like a tower, and consisted of seven hides, covered with a plate of brass. (Homer, Iliad {GREEK:START Z}Ζ{GREEK:END}) (Calmet)"
      v:008:
        - '1SA:17:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Out;</i> exulting, Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 5. (Menochius) --- <i>Servants;</i> I am free. (Haydock) --- <i>Hand.</i> Such combats were very common in ancient times. Paris and Menelaus, Hector and Ajax. The Horatii and Curiatii fought to decide the fate of contending nations. (Homer, Iliad<i> <u>g</u>,</i> and {GREEK:START H}H{GREEK:END}.) --- (Livy i. 23.) (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - 1SA:17:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Us.</i> It does not appear that this proposal was accepted or ratified by either party. The Israelites had still to pursue the enemy. (Estius)
      v:012:
        - "1SA:17:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Now,</i> &c., to ver. 32. <i>And when,</i> is omitted in the Vatican Septuagint, which begins the latter verse thus, \"And David said,\" as the Alexandrian copy does now the 12th, which leads Kennicott to suspect that the intermediate verses are an interpolation, formerly unknown to the Greek version. Houbigant includes these verses between crotchets, \"that it may be understood that these are not of the same author as the rest, and that the sacred writer may not be accused of making useless repetitions.\" It has been observed in the last chapter, that David was the son of Isai, &c. \"If, says he, this be omitted, there will be no vacuum in the context,\" as there is none in the Roman edition: (<b>11</b>) \"they were greatly afraid. (<b>32.</b>) And David said to Saul,\" &c. As he had been appointed Saul's armour-bearer, it was very natural to suppose that he would be near the king's person on such an occasion, rather than feeding sheep. We find also, that he had a <i>tent</i> of his own, (ver. 54) which he could not have had, if he had only come to bring provisions to his brethren. The unaccountable conduct of Eliab, the timidity of all Israel for forty days, &c., will thus be avoided. Josephus is supposed to have given occasion to this embellishment, though he takes no notice of many of those particulars which excite the surprise of Pilkington, Kennicott, Aquila, &c., and Origen received them from the Jews as genuine. A Hebrew Bible, (1661) with marginal criticisms, by a Jew, includes these verses within parentheses, as interpolated, as well as from ver. 55 to chap. xviii. 6, observing that, \"the history consists at present of different and inconsistent accounts.\" The Syriac manuscript of Masius generally confirms the Vatican Septuagint (Morin) so that we conclude, that these verses are there asterisked on the authority of Origen, as not being in the original Greek, nor consequently in Hebrew. (ibid. p. 575.) --- <i>Mentioned.</i> Hebrew, \"Juda, whose name....and the man went among men, an old man in the days of Saul.\" We have already observed that the Alexandrian Septuagint seems to promise a <i>speech,</i> but defers till ver. 32, thus, \"And David said, the son of an Ephrathite. He was from,\" &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Men.</i> Chaldean, \"He was an old man, whom they ranked among the young,\" as still vigorous. <i>Jam senior, sed cruda seni viridisque senectus.</i> (Calmet)"
      v:013:
        - '1SA:17:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Battle.</i> In these wars, all attended as much as possible, chap. xvi. 10.'
      v:015:
        - '1SA:17:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Bethlehem,</i> the king being relieved from his malady. "The greatest men formerly kept sheep." <i>Ex antiquis illustrissimus quisque pastor erat.</i> (Varro ii. 1.) In this profession, David found many opportunities of signalizing his courage against wild beasts. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - '1SA:17:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Loaves.</i> The soldiers at that time, and perhaps always among the Hebrews, lived at their own expense, as the tribute which was paid to the king was not sufficient to support large armies, ver. 25. (Calmet) --- St. Paul insinuates, however, that soldiers were paid, 1 Corinthians ix. 7. (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - '1SA:17:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Cheeses.</i> Hebrew, "of milk." Septuagint, "pieces of soft cheese:" <em>é</em><em>rts</em> is no where else used to denote cheese. This was a present (Calmet) for (Hebrew) "the Chiliarch." --- <i>Placed,</i> who is their immediate officer. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "how they are mixed:" their company. Septuagint, &c., "what they stand in need of." Symmachus, "Thou shalt receive their pay." Syriac and Arabic, "what news." Others would translate, "their pledge," or bill of divorce to their wives, that, in case they be made prisoners for three years, the latter may be allowed to marry. (Trad. Heb.[Hebrew tradition?]) (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - '1SA:17:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Fighting,</i> or ready to engage. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - '1SA:17:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Magala</i> signifies, "the circle, <i>or</i> chariots." The Arabs still place their waggons and baggage round the camp, or in a circle. (Calmet) --- It may also be a proper name. (Menochius)'
      v:022:
        - '1SA:17:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Brethren.</i> This inquiry seems rather unseasonable, when all were shouting for battle. (Kennicott)'
      v:023:
        - '1SA:17:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Up,</i> or proceeding into the vale. (Menochius) --- <i>Camp.</i> Hebrew, "ranks, <i>or</i> armies."'
      v:024:
        - '1SA:17:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Exceedingly,</i> though they had now heard him twice a-day for so long a time, (Kennicott) and came purposely to engage him and all the Philistine army. Perhaps he proceeded farther than usual. (Haydock)'
      v:025:
        - '1SA:17:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Tribute,</i> and all public charges, which may be burdensome. (Calmet) --- It does not appear that these words are addressed to any one in particular, nor that the king had authorized such a declaration. (Haydock) --- Yet the people all persisted in the same declaration, so that a promise must have been made. (Menochius) --- It was never at least fulfilled. (Haydock) --- Christ having overcome the devil, receives the Church for his spouse. (Worthington)'
      v:028:
        - '1SA:17:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Battle.</i> This speech is too insulting, even though David might seem to have given vent to the sentiments of his soul with too much ardour; particularly as Eliab knew that he had received the royal unction, (Calmet) if that were not kept a secret from him, chap. xvi. 13.'
      v:029:
        - "1SA:17:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Sepak.</i> Literally, \"is it not a word\" (Haydock) of no farther consequences? May I not speak my sentiments? (Calmet) as all others do. (Menochius) --- Is not the thing enough to excite the indignation even of the coldest person, to hear this monster insulting God's armies? The repeated inquiries of David, made people conclude that he was ready to fight the giant, (Haydock) though as yet he had made no such proposal, whence it seems more improbable that his words would be reported to the king. (Kennicott) --- Protestants, \"Is there not a cause?\" (Haydock) --- Have I not an order from my father to come? (Menochius)"
      v:032:
        - '1SA:17:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Saul.</i> Literally, "to him." But Hebrew and Septuagint have, "And David said to Saul," which makes the connection between this and ver. 11, more clear. (Haydock) --- <i>In him,</i> or on account of Goliath. (Menochius)'
      v:033:
        - '1SA:17:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Boy,</i> compared with the giant, (Haydock) or Saul, though David might be about 22 years old, (Salien) or near 30. (Tirinus) --- St. Augustine and Theodoret say only 14 or 16. (Menochius) --- He had not yet been in the wars. (Calmet)'
      v:035:
        - '1SA:17:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Them.</i> He refers to two events, shewing his fortitude (Calmet) and generous disposition, which rendered him fit for command, as he was not afraid to expose his life to protect his charge. (Haydock) --- The pastoral care is an apprenticeship for the throne to him who is designed to be at the head of the mild flock of men, as hunting with dogs conducts to martial exploits. (Philo in Vita Mosis.) --- He who has overcome the spirit of pride and of carnal pleasures, signified by the lion and the bear, is able also to gain a victory over the devil. (Worthington)'
      v:036:
        - '1SA:17:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>I will....Philistine.</i> This is not in Hebrew or the Septuagint, and it is marked as an addition in the ancient manuscripts. (Calmet) --- Single combats, to prevent the spilling of more blood, may sometimes be authorized by public authority. (Grotius)'
      v:039:
        - '1SA:17:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Armour.</i> Hebrew, "he tried to go." Symmachus, "he went lame." Septuagint, "he laboured in walking once and twice." (Calmet) --- Salien supposes that the armour was not made for Saul, as he was much more bulky than young David. Yet we find that the latter could use the sword of the giant without difficulty. (St. Chrysostom, &c.) (Haydock)'
      v:040:
        - '1SA:17:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Smooth.</i> Louis de Dieu translates broken "pieces of stones," as he pretends, contrary to the common opinion, that rough stones are more suitable for the sling. (Calmet) --- The learned Jew, whom we have cited above, (ver. 12,) and several others, have inferred from this verse, that David seems to have just come from the flock. But Kennicott justly observes, that slingers were of great service in the army; and the "vessel of shepherds," the bag or scrip, might well be used to obtain the stones; as the staff, <i>makel,</i> denotes a military weapon. (Taylor, Conc.) (Diss. ii. p. 555.) David was very expert in using these weapons, and the ordinary armour was encumbering to him. (Haydock) --- "Valour depends more on its own efforts than on armour," <i>tegumentis.</i> (St. Ambrose, Off. i.)'
      v:043:
        - '1SA:17:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Gods.</i> Dagon or Baalim. (Menochius) -- Septuagint Alexandrian has, "idols." The beauty and accoutrements of David, made the rough warrior suppose that he was not coming to fight, but only to laugh at him and run away. (Haydock)'
      v:044:
        - 1SA:17:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>Earth.</i> The heroes of modern days refrain from such compliments. Homer frequently describes his champions making long speeches in praise of their former exploits. David displays his piety and confidence in God. (Calmet)
      v:047:
        - '1SA:17:47 | 47 | 47 | <i>Battle,</i> whose armies thou hast defied, (ver. 45.; Haydock) or in general, He is the God of war, who grants victory to whom He pleases. (Calmet)'
      v:048:
        - 1SA:17:48 | 48 | 48 | <i>Arose.</i> The Roman Triarii and the Gauls expected the hour of battle sitting. (Calmet)
      v:049:
        - '1SA:17:49 | 49 | 49 | <i>Forehead.</i> "The soul....more probably resides in the callous body of the brain," (Eyre, Thesis 1797,) between the eyes. (Haydock) --- <i>Earth,</i> quite lifeless, (Salien) or unable to resist. (Menochius) --- The Balearic slingers scarcely ever missed their mark. (Livy, viii. 4.) The Chaldean supposes that David hit the eye, which was not covered with brass: but the stone might penetrate or kill Goliath through his helmet. Even a buckler is not capable of withstanding their violence. (Diodorus, v. 207.) See Judges xx. 16. (Calmet) --- Pride sits on the forehead, and manifests itself by impudent behaviour. We must destroy it by humility, and by the cross of Christ. (St. Augustine) (Worthington)'
      v:054:
        - "1SA:17:54 | 54 | 54 | <i>Tent,</i> or the tabernacle of the Lord, which David erected in his honour, at Jerusalem, many years afterwards. (Jun. Piscator, &c.) The lower part of Jerusalem was already in the hands of the Israelites. He might place the armour for the present in the tent of his brethren. We find that the sword was deposited in the tabernacle, at Nobe. (Calmet) See ver. 12. (Haydock) --- The head was carried about to various cities. It would serve to strike terror into the Jebusites, at Jerusalem, and others. (Menochius) --- The Vatican Septuagint, &c., immediately subjoin, chap. xviii. 6. <i>Now,</i> &c. Literally, \"And the women dancing, came to meet David.\" (Haydock) --- These three last verses occur only in the Alexandrian manuscript, though Theodoret (q. 43,) seems to have read them. In some other Greek copies, there is a long addition respecting David's combat. See the New Hexapla. These verses are found, however, in Hebrew, Chaldean, &c. It is astonishing that Saul should not have known David. He was now more interested to be acquainted with his family, as he had engaged to give him his daughter in marriage. We must reflect that his malady might have impaired his memory, and David was still growing, so that a few months absence might produce a wonderful alteration, &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Know not.</i> Literally, \"if I know.\" The different dress, in which David now appeared, gave rise to this ignorance. (Menochius) --- Abner was not surely affected with the same malady as the king, who was obliged to ask David who was his father. But courtiers easily forget those from whom they have no expectations. (Haydock) --- These strange proceedings make others conclude that this history is interpolated. (Kennicott) --- Huet maintains the contrary. (Du Hamel) --- Saul only enquires about David's parentage. (Mariana) (Tirinus)"

      v:008: '1SA:17:8 | 8 | 8 | And standing, he cried out to the bands of Israel, and said to them: Why are you come out prepared to fight? am not I a Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose out a man of you, and let him come down and fight hand to hand.'
      v:009: '1SA:17:9 | 9 | 9 | If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, we will be servants to you: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, you shall be servants, and shall serve us.'

      v:011: '1SA:17:11 | 11 | 11 | And Saul and all the Israelites hearing these words of the Philistine, were dismayed, and greatly afraid.'
      v:012: '1SA:17:12 | 12 | 12 | Now David was the son of that Ephrathite, of Bethlehem Juda, before mentioned, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}whose name was Isai, who had eight sons, and was an old man in the days of Saul, and of great age among men.'
      v:013: '1SA:17:13 | 13 | 13 | And his three eldest sons followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle, were Eliab, the first-born, and the second, Abinadab, and the third, Samma:'
      v:014: '1SA:17:14 | 14 | 14 | But David was the youngest. So the three eldest having followed Saul,'

      v:016: '1SA:17:16 | 16 | 16 | Now the Philistine came out morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.'
      v:017: '1SA:17:17 | 17 | 17 | And Isai said to David, his son: Take for thy brethren an ephi of frumenty, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren,'

      v:020: '1SA:17:20 | 20 | 20 | David, therefore, arose in the morning, and gave the charge of the flock to the keeper: and went away loaded, as Isai had commanded him. And he came to the place of Magala, and to the army, which was going out to fight, and shouted for the battle.'
      v:021: '1SA:17:21 | 21 | 21 | For Israel had put themselves in array, and the Philistines who stood against them were prepared.'
      v:022: '1SA:17:22 | 22 | 22 | And David leaving the vessels which he had brought, under the care of the keeper of the baggage, ran to the place of the battle, and asked if all things went well with his brethren.'
      v:023: '1SA:17:23 | 23 | 23 | And as he talked with them, that base-born man, whose name was Goliath, the Philistine, of Geth, shewed himself coming up from the camp of the Philistines: and he spoke according to the same words, <em>and</em> David heard <i>them</i>.'
      v:024: '1SA:17:24 | 24 | 24 | And all the Israelites, when they saw the man, fled from his face, fearing him exceedingly.'

      v:026: '1SA:17:26 | 26 | 26 | And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying: What shall be given to the man that shall kill this Philistine, and shall take away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?'
      v:027: '1SA:17:27 | 27 | 27 | And the people answered him the same words, saying: These things shall be given to the man that shall slay him.'
      v:028: '1SA:17:28 | 28 | 28 | Now when Eliab, his eldest brother, heard this, when he was speaking with others, he was angry with David, and said: Why camest thou hither? and why didst thou leave those few sheep in the desert? I know thy pride, and the wickedness of thy heart: that thou art come down to see the battle.'
      v:029: '1SA:17:29 | 29 | 29 | And David said: What have I done? is there not cause to speak?'
      v:030: '1SA:17:30 | 30 | 30 | And he turned a little aside from him to another: and said the same word. And the people answered him as before.'

      v:032: "1SA:17:32 | 32 | 32 | And when he was brought to <i>Saul</i>, he said to him: Let not any man's heart be dismayed in him: I thy servant will go, and will fight against the Philistine."
      v:033: '1SA:17:33 | 33 | 33 | And Saul said to David: Thou art not able to withstand this Philistine, nor to fight against him: for thou art <i>but</i> a boy, but he is a warrior from his youth.'
      v:034: "1SA:17:34 | 34 | 34 | And David said to Saul: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 1}or a bear, and took a ram out of the midst of the flock:"
      v:035: '1SA:17:35 | 35 | 35 | And I pursued after them, and struck them, and delivered it out of their mouth: and they rose up against me, and I caught them by the throat, and I strangled, and killed them.'
      v:036: '1SA:17:36 | 36 | 36 | For I thy servant have killed both a lion and a bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be also as one of them. I will go now, and take away the reproach of the people: for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, who hath dared to curse the army of the living God?'
      v:037: '1SA:17:37 | 37 | 37 | And David said: The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David: Go, and the Lord be with thee.'
      v:038: '1SA:17:38 | 38 | 38 | And Saul clothed David with his garments, and put a helmet of brass upon his head, and armed him with a coat of mail.'
      v:039: '1SA:17:39 | 39 | 39 | And David having girded his sword upon his armour, began to try if he could walk in armour: for he was not accustomed to it. And David said to Saul: I cannot go thus, for I am not used to it. And he laid them off,'
      v:040: "1SA:17:40 | 40 | 40 | And he took his staff, which he had always in his hands: and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them into the shepherd's scrip, which he had with him, and he took a sling in his hand, and went forth against the Philistine."
      v:041: '1SA:17:41 | 41 | 41 | And the Philistine came on, and drew nigh against David, and his armour-bearer <em>went</em> before him.'
      v:042: '1SA:17:42 | 42 | 42 | And when the Philistine looked, and beheld David, he despised him. For he was a young man, ruddy, and of a comely countenance.'
      v:043: '1SA:17:43 | 43 | 43 | And the Philistine said to David: Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with a staff? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.'
      v:044: '1SA:17:44 | 44 | 44 | And he said to David: Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth.'
      v:045: '1SA:17:45 | 45 | 45 | And David said to the Philistine: Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, which thou hast defied.'
      v:046: '1SA:17:46 | 46 | 46 | This day, and the Lord will deliver thee into my hand, and I will slay thee, and take away thy head from thee: and I will give the carcasses of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth: that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.'
      v:047: '1SA:17:47 | 47 | 47 | And all this assembly shall know, that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for it is his battle, and he will deliver you into our hands.'

(St. Chrysostom, hom. i. de Saul.) --- The jealousy of Saul was the more excited, as he had been threatened with the loss of his kingdom, and perceived in David all the qualifications of a king. <i>A malo principe tanquam successor timetur quisquis est dignior.</i> (Pliny in Traj.) --- But was David responsible for what was spoken in his praise? (Calmet) --- The Vatican Septuagint omit what follows till ver. 12. "And Saul feared David, (<b>13</b>) and he removed," &c. The Alexandrian copy agrees with the Vulgate.

To alleviate his distress, David took up his harp. (Haydock) --- <i>Spear.</i> With this weapon he was generally armed, chap. xix. 10., and xxvi. 7.

(Haydock) --- <i>Wife.</i> He had promised her already, (Menochius) if the verses in the preceding chapter be genuine. But why then had he delayed so long, and why does he require other conditions? The comparison made by the women, (ver. 7,) and the inconstant temper of Saul, might account for this. (Haydock) --- <i>The Lord</i> defends his people. As long as the Israelites followed the orders of God, their wars might justly be attributed to him; but not when they were waged to satisfy the cravings of ambition. (Calmet)'

        - '1SA:18:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Wife.</i> If this were the case, the character of Saul is rendered more despicable and perfidious. David never reclaims Merob, as he did Michol.

(Haydock) --- Saul had deceived him with respect to the first; but he promises that he shall have "the second," (Calmet) or two motives induced the king to make him this offer, the victory over Goliath, and the slaughter of 100 Philistines. (Menochius; Tirinus) --- The Septuagint omit this sentence, and read, "And the hand of the Philistines was upon Saul, and Saul commended," &c.'

(Calmet) --- Josephus specifies six hundred heads, (Haydock) falsely, (Horn) as he frequently disguises what might give his readers offence, as being either mean or incredible. (Calmet) --- <i>Hundred</i> is not specified in the original Hebrew copies, (Capel, iii. 17,) and David gives 200, ver. 27. But Saul only stipulated for 100. See 2 Kings iii. 14. (Calmet) --- <i>Wife,</i> "thinking it mean to be guilty of an untruth," &c., says Josephus; "yet his disposition was not altered. He resolved, therefore, to take away his life, and wished Jonathan and his most trusty servants to put his designs in execution." He then mentions the friendship of these two. But he takes no notice of the proffered marriage of Merob, and he seems not to have known that she was ever promised. See ver. 17., and 19., and chap. xvii. 12. (Haydock)'

"And all Israel lived him; (<b>29</b>) and Saul still continued to be in awe of him." The Alexandrian manuscript agrees with the Hebrew, only, instead of <i>Michol,</i> &c., it reads, "all Israel." If the contested passages were omitted, the history would be less perplexed. But we must wait for the decision of the Church in matters of this nature, and never decide to peremptorily. (Haydock)'

We are not to judge of the indecency of such behaviour from our own manners. Some copies read <i>cecinit,</i> (Calmet) and the Douay Bible has \"and sang naked.\" (Haydock) --- Saul had not the gift of prophecy, like holy men, but only like Balaam's ass, for a time.

      v:006: '1SA:19:6 | 6 | 6 | And when Saul heard this, he was appeased with the words of Jonathan, and swore: As the Lord liveth, he shall not be slain.'
      v:007: '1SA:19:7 | 7 | 7 | Then Jonathan called David, and told him all these words: and Jonathan brought in David to Saul, and he was before him, as he had been yesterday and the day before.'
      v:008: '1SA:19:8 | 8 | 8 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And the war began again, and David went out, and fought against the Philistines, and defeated them with a great slaughter, and they fled from his face.'
      v:009: '1SA:19:9 | 9 | 9 | And the evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul; and he sat in his house, and held a spear in his hand: and David played with his hand.'
      v:010: '1SA:19:10 | 10 | 10 | And Saul endeavoured to nail David to the wall with his spear. And David slipt away out of the presence of Saul: and the spear missed him, and was fastened in the wall, and David fled, and escaped that night.'
      v:011: "1SA:19:11 | 11 | 11 | Saul therefore sent his guards to David's house to watch him, that he might be killed in the morning. And when Michol, David's wife, had told him this, saying: Unless thou save thyself this night, to-morrow thou wilt die:"
      v:012: '1SA:19:12 | 12 | 12 | She let him down through a window. And he went and fled away, and escaped.'
      v:013: "1SA:19:13 | 13 | 13 | And Michol took an image, and laid it on the bed, and put a goat's skin, with the hair at the head of it, and covered it with clothes."
      v:014: 1SA:19:14 | 14 | 14 | And Saul sent officers to seize David; and it was answered that he was sick.
      v:015: '1SA:19:15 | 15 | 15 | And again Saul sent to see David, saying: Bring him to me in the bed, that he may be slain.'
      v:016: "1SA:19:16 | 16 | 16 | And when the messengers were come in, they found an image upon the bed, and a goat's skin at his head."
      v:017: '1SA:19:17 | 17 | 17 | And Saul said to Michol: Why hast thou deceived me so, and let my enemy go and flee away? And Michol answered Saul: Because he said to me: Let me go, or else I will kill thee.'
      v:018: '1SA:19:18 | 18 | 18 | But David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel in Ramatha, and told him all that Saul had done to him: and he and Samuel went and dwelt in Najoth.'
      v:019: '1SA:19:19 | 19 | 19 | And it was told Saul by some, saying: Behold David is in Najoth, in Ramatha.'
      v:020: '1SA:19:20 | 20 | 20 | So Saul sent officers to take David: and when they saw a company of prophets prophesying, and Samuel presiding over them, the Spirit of the Lord came also upon them, and they likewise began to prophesy.'
      v:021: '1SA:19:21 | 21 | 21 | And when this was told Saul, he sent other messengers: but they also prophesied. And again Saul sent messengers the third time: and they prophesied also. And Saul being exceeding angry,'
      v:022: '1SA:19:22 | 22 | 22 | Went also himself to Ramatha, and came as far as the great cistern, which is in Socho, and he asked, and said: In what place are Samuel and David? And it was told him: Behold they are in Najoth, in Ramatha.'
      v:023: '1SA:19:23 | 23 | 23 | And he went to Najoth, in Ramatha, and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied till he came to Najoth, in Ramatha.'
      v:024: '1SA:19:24 | 24 | 24 | And he stripped himself also of his garments, and prophesied with the rest before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and night. This gave occasion to a proverb: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}What! is Saul too among the prophets?'

      v:002:
        - '1SA:20:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Be.</i> The recent machinations and orders of Saul had been concealed from his son, with whom he used to consult on all important matters. (Calmet) --- Perceiving, however, that Jonathan was unwilling to come into his measures, Saul, in his phrenzy, tried to destroy David. (Haydock) --- But Jonathan, forming his judgment of others by his own upright heart, relied on the oath of his father, (Calmet) and on the information he had lately communicated to him, when he desired David to be slain. (Menochius) --- Abulensis believes that the particulars of a preceding reconciliation have been lost, which Salien supplies, the year of the world 2973.'
      v:003:
        - '1SA:20:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>As I may say,</i> is not in Hebrew. Septuagint, "the space between me and thy father is filled up, unto death." We can never more have any union, nor dwell together in safety. (Haydock)'

      v:005:
        - "1SA:20:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>To-morrow is the new moon.</i> The <i>neomenia,</i> or first day of the moon, kept according to the law, as a festival; and therefore Saul feasted on that day; and expected the attendance of his family. (Challoner) (Numbers x. 10.) --- <i>Moon.</i> Literally, \"calends,\" a Greek word, intimating that the people were informed, or \"called\" together, on that occasion; as many nations follow the lunar system in the regulation of the year. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins say that people were stationed on the highest hills to observe the first appearance of the moon, and to give notice of it. But for fear of a mistake, two days were observed, as here we see that Saul gave a feast for such a length of time. This, however, is very uncertain. David speaks without any reference to the watchmen, as of a thing well known to all. The reason of Saul's feasting two days, was because one of them was the sabbath. The following work-day David came to Nobe, (ver. 19,) and partook of the loaves which had been changed on the sabbath day, chap. xxi. 6., and Leviticus xxiv. 8. --- <i>Sit.</i> The custom of sitting at table seems to have been more ancient than that of lying. The Persians chiefly introduced the latter. They had very low tables, so that one of them was placed under the feet of Alexander, when he sat upon the throne of Darius, which was too high for him. (Curtius v.) Both customs frequently prevailed at the same time, Ecclesiasticus ix. 12., and xxxi. 12. Women probably always sat, as the Chaldean says Esther did, Esther vii. 8. See Athen. i. 14. V. Max. ii. 1. --- <i>Day.</i> The second of the month, after the sabbath was ended. (Calmet) --- Pezron thinks that both the last and first days of the month were festivals. (Du Hamel)"
      v:006:
        - '1SA:20:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Tribe.</i> It might seem an effect of pride, not to accept of such invitations of the king, without some good excuse. Ovid speaks of feasts instituted for relations alone. (Fast. ii.){JOIN}{BQ:2}<em>Proxima cognati dixere Charistia cari</em>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<em>Et venit ad socios turba propinqua Deos.</em> (Menochius){JOIN}--- Saul might pretend that his throwing his spear at David, was an effect of his distemper; and as the latter had returned to his palace after the first attempt, he might judge that he would do the like now, though he had so lately sought his life. David probably retired to <i>Bethlehem,</i> and returned the third day, when he bid adieu to Jonathan and to the court of Saul for ever, (ver. 21.; Calmet) though he saw Jonathan once more at Ziph, chap. xxiii. 16.'
      v:007:
        - '1SA:20:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Height.</i> Hebrew, "the evil is completed (or resolved upon) by him." (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - '1SA:20:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Lord,</i> the most durable and sacred, confirmed by the name of God. (Calmet) --- <i>Kill.</i> So Moses besought God to take away his life. A friend would put him to as little torture as possible. (Menochius) --- But David only means strongly to assert his own innocence. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - '1SA:20:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Thee.</i> Hebrew, "then, should I not tell thee?" (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "and if it reach not thy cities, I will inform thee."'
      v:012:
        - '1SA:20:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>After.</i> Septuagint, "The Lord....has known that I will sift my father, as opportunity shall serve, thrice," or repeatedly. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - "1SA:20:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Father,</i> at the beginning of his reign. Jonathan foresees that David will be his father's successor. (Calmet) --- Hence he commends himself and family to his protection. (Menochius)"
      v:014:
        - '1SA:20:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Die.</i> Hebrew literally, "If I live, thou shalt not shew me, &c....and if I die, (<b>15</b>) thou shalt not," &c. It seems there is a negation too much. Jonathan requests that David would shew mercy to him and to his family; or he is willing that neither should partake of his kindness, if he prove a traitor to his friend. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "And thou shalt not only, while yet I live, shew me the kindness of the Lord, that I die not: (<b>15</b>) But <i>also</i> thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever, no not when the Lord hath cut off," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:015:
        - "1SA:20:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>May he.</i> It is a curse upon himself, if he should not be faithful to his promise. --- <i>It.</i> That is, revenge it upon David's enemies, and upon me, if I shall fail of my word given to him. (Challoner) --- The Hebrew and several Latin manuscripts stop at <i>earth;</i> and what follows, is not found in some Greek and Latin editions. (Calmet) --- <i>Enemies.</i> May God punish David's enemies, and me among the rest. (Menochius)"
      v:016:
        - "1SA:20:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Enemies.</i> This seems to be a second translation of the former sentence, with a small variation. --- <i>Required</i> may be expressed in the future, as an imprecation made by the two friends against those who should attempt to break the covenant, or to oppose David's reign. Septuagint omit this verse entirely, and translate the following, (<b>17</b>) \"and Jonathan continued to swear to David, inasmuch as he loved him, because he loved the soul of the man who loved him.\" He had such an affection for David, that he extended his love to all his friends. Protestants, \"so Jonathan made <i>a covenant</i> with....David, <i>saying:</i> Let the Lord even require <i>it</i> at,\" &c. (Haydock) --- He did so in due time, and the covenant between these two had its effect. (Calmet)"
      v:019:
        - '1SA:20:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Morrow.</i> Hebrew, "and after three days (Haydock; or, on the third day) thou shalt," &c. Syriac and Arabic, "Thou wilt be called for at table, at the third hour." (Calmet) --- Septuagint use the same word, {GREEK:START trioseuseis}τριοσηυσηισ{GREEK:END}, as in the following verse: "I will shoot thrice at wild beasts, with arrows, sending as far as Laarmattarai," so here they may insinuate that David must "wait three days," (Haydock) or come on each of these days, that he may not slip an opportunity. (Cajetan) --- <i>Work.</i> Le Clerc translates, "in the day of the business." Protestants, "where thou didst hide thyself when the business was <i>in hand,</i> and shalt remain by the stone Ezel." Alexandrian Septuagint, "by this affair." Vatican [Septuagint], "<i>Ergab,</i>" a word which Grabe admits instead of {GREEK:START ergon}ηργον{GREEK:END}, in his edition. (Haydock) --- Other copies, with the Syriac and Arabic, have simply, "near this stone," which Junius styles <i>speculam,</i> as if it were a butt or landmark, (Calmet) or a stone to shew the road, (Lyranus) or mile-stone, (Tirinus) which latter supposition is not probable, as David desired to be concealed. (Menochius) --- He would therefore choose some cavern, so as to be able to hear what Jonathan said, without being seen. (Haydock) --- this precaution was necessary for the safety of both. (Menochius)'
      v:023:
        - 1SA:20:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Ever.</i> Let us always inviolably adhere to our covenant. (Haydock)

(Calmet) --- Protestants, \"son of the perverse rebellious <i>woman.</i>\" Septuagint, \"of the fugitive, (Haydock) <i>or</i> of those girls who go in quest of men.\" We must not suppose that Jonathan's mother was really of this description. Saul, in rage, wishes to affront his son, (Calmet) as some frantic parents call their children bastards, not reflecting that the reproach would fall upon themselves. --- <i>Isai,</i> as he styles him out of contempt, ver. 27. --- <i>Mother.</i> Hebrew, &c., \"of thy mother's nakedness <i>or</i> shame.\" (Menochius) --- Instead of a crown, thou must expect ot be reduced to a private station, to the disgrace of my family.

(Haydock) --- All the crime of David, was his too exalted merit, which, under a jealous prince, is often fatal. <i>Nec minus periculum ex magnâ famâ, quam ex malâ.</i> (Tacitus, Agricola.)'
      v:034:
        - '1SA:20:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Great.</i> Literally, in the anger of fury." (Haydock) --- <i>Him,</i> either David or Jonathan. (Calmet) --- Indeed the crime of rebellion had been imputed to both. (Haydock) --- Jonathan was grieved on account of the affront and danger (Menochius) to which he had been publicly exposed, as well as for his friend, upon whose destruction he perceived that his father was now deliberately bent, and not merely during his fits of madness. --- <i>Confusion.</i> Septuagint, "because his father had completed <i>his malice</i> against him;" (Haydock) or, "had resolved to make an end of him." (Calmet)'
      v:036:
        - '1SA:20:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Another.</i> The Hebrew, &c., do not express this distinctly; (Calmet) but we find, ver. 38, "the lad gathered up the arrows."'

      v:001:
        - '1SA:21:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Nobe.</i> A city in the tribe of Benjamin, to which the tabernacle of the Lord had been translated from Silo. (Challoner) --- It was about 12 miles south-west of Gabaa. (Tudelensis.) --- There was another Nobe on the east side of the Jordan, to which Serarius thinks David was three days in travelling. But when David made that assertion, he wished to conceal the real state of his affairs, as he had not seen Saul since he was at Najoth, ver. 5. Nobe was afterwards accounted a sacerdotal city, ver. 19., and 2 Esdras xi. 32. --- <i>Achimelech,</i> who is perhaps the same with Achia (chap. xiv. 3,) and Abiathar, Mark ii. 32. --- <i>With thee.</i> He would not expose his men to the resentment of Saul, (Calmet) though he afterwards gave the priest to understand that he had some attendants, (ver. 2) as the gospel relates, Matthew xii. 3. He dismissed them before he entered Geth. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - '1SA:21:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>The king,</i> &c. This was an untruth, which David, like many other great men, might think lawful in such an emergency. But it is essentially evil. (Calmet) --- <i>And such,</i> which he deems it unnecessary to specify. Septuagint retain the Hebrew words, "Phelanni almoni." See Ruth iv. 1.'
      v:004:
        - '1SA:21:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>If the young men be clean,</i> &c. If this cleanness was required of them that were to eat that bread, which was but a figure of the bread of life which we receive in the blessed sacrament [the Eucharist]; how clean ought Christians be when they approach to our tremendous mysteries? And what reason hath the Church of God to admit none to be her ministers, to consecrate and daily receive this most pure sacrament, but such as devote themselves to a life of perpetual purity. (Challoner) --- <i>Women.</i> God required this on many occasions, Exodus xix. 15. Urgent necessity determined Achimelech to grant the loaves, as our Saviour intimates, though it is probable that he first consulted the Lord, chap. xxii. 16. (Calmet) --- David perhaps went to Nobe on purpose to ask advice. (Menochius) --- We have here an example of a dispensation, and of the distinction between <i>lay,</i> or common, and holy bread. (Worthington)'
      v:005:
        - "1SA:21:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Vessels,</i> i.e., the bodies, have been <i>holy;</i> that is, have been kept from impurity: (Challoner) in which sense St. Paul uses the word, 1 Thessalonians iv. 4. It also includes garments, arms, &c. All was to be clean. Septuagint, \"my men are all purified.\" (Calmet) --- <i>Defiled.</i> Is liable to expose us to dangers of uncleanness, (Challoner) as we shall perhaps have to fight. (Haydock) --- <i>Sanctified.</i> That is, we shall take care, notwithstanding these dangerous circumstances, to keep our <i>vessels holy;</i> that is, keep our bodies from every thing that may defile us. (Challoner) --- The text is very obscure. Hebrew, \"the way is impure, because to-day it shall be purified in the vessel.\" (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"and <i>the bread is</i> in a manner common, yea though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.\" We might eat of it in a case of such necessity. (Haydock) --- Though laics be commonly debarred from tasting of it, we will partake of it with all due respect. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"the journey is (of a disagreeable nature, or) impure, therefore it will be rendered holy by my vessels,\" or arms, in the king's cause. (Haydock) --- He seemed to be going towards the infidel nations. (Menochius)"
      v:007:
        - '1SA:21:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Within.</i> Hebrew <i>nehtsar,</i> "detained, <i>or</i> assembles before the Lord." Theodoret thinks he was possessed; others believe he had made a vow, &c. --- <i>Edomite.</i> Some Greek copies read, a Syrian, as also chap. xxii. 9. (Calmet) --- He had embraced the Jewish religion. (Menochius)'
      v:009:
        - '1SA:21:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>This.</i> Chaldean observes, he gave this sword "after he had consulted the Lord with the ephod." In a just war, the ornaments of the temples may be used. <i>Pro republic îplerumque templa nudantur.</i> (Seneca) (Grotius, Jur. iii. 5, 2.) (Calmet) --- Tostatus believes that David would restore this sword, as soon as he had procured other arms.'
      v:010:
        - "1SA:21:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Achis.</i> He is elsewhere called Achimelech. This bold step was taken by God's order, (Salien) or secret impulse, as the high priest and Doeg knew not whither David had directed his course. (Haydock) --- Sanchez thinks David received no express declaration, as the event was not very prosperous. (Menochius) --- Many great men have taken refuge among their greatest enemies, as Themistocles, Alcibiades, and Coriolanus fled respectively to the Persians, Lacedæmonians, and Volscians, and were received with great respect. Indeed the acquisition of such men is equivalent to a victory. (Calmet) --- Though David might expect that his name would be hateful at Geth, as he had slain their great champion, &c., yet he had done it in an open manner, and had displayed the most heroic courage, so that the king and nobility might raise their thoughts above the vulgar sentiments of jealousy and revenge. (Salien) --- David only retired from the court of this king, to avoid the hatred of the courtiers; he returned again, and was kindly received, chap. xxvii. 1. (Calmet)"
      v:011:
        - '1SA:21:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Land,</i> equal to a king in glory. (Menochius) --- Perhaps they had heard of the rejection of Saul, and reflected that their own country belonged to him, according to the terms proposed by Goliath. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - "1SA:21:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Countenance.</i> Hebrew, \"sentiment, (Calmet) <i>or,</i> behaviour.\" (Haydock) --- Chaldean, \"reason.\" He no longer acted as a prudent man, but like a fool. --- <i>Down;</i> not fainting, (Calmet) but like one in an epileptic fit. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, \"he feigned himself mad.\" Chaldean, \"stupid.\" --- <i>Stumbled.</i> Hebrew, \"wrote, or made figures upon.\" Septuagint, \"beat the drum upon the gates of the city, and he was carried about, or acted the fool, in his hands, ({GREEK:START parephereto en tais chersin, autou}παρηφηρητο ην ταισ χηρσιν, αυτου{GREEK:END}: Amama would have, {GREEK:START auton}αυτον{GREEK:END}, their) and he fell against the doors of the gate,\" &c. They seem to give a double translation. St. Augustine says, \"we cannot understand how David could be carried in his own hands. But we understand how it was verified in Christ. For Christ was carried in his own hands at his last supper, when he gave, <i>or</i> commending, his own body, he said, This, &c., for he then carried his own body in his own hands.\" (In Psalm xxxiii. conc. i.) <i>Ferebat enim illud corpus in manibus suis.</i> Amama may laugh at St. Augustine's ignorance of Hebrew, but the holy doctor was at least a sincere Catholic. (Haydock) --- <i>Beard.</i> We find some wretched objects doing the same, Mark ix. 17. The spittle was deemed infectious. <i>Et illic isti qui sputatur, morbus interdum venit.</i> (Plautus in Captivis.)"
      v:015:
        - '1SA:21:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>House.</i> David had not rushed into the palace of his own accord, but wished to remain concealed. Some of the people however knew him, and would have him to enlist as one of the soldiers of Achis; (Menochius) or even designed to get him put to death, which made him have recourse to this expedient. Some of the saints have imitated him, to avoid worldly honours and dignities of the Church. (Haydock) --- Thus the conduct of Jesus Christ himself, was accounted foolishness by worldlings, Mark iii. 21., Luke xxiii. 11., and 1 Corinthians i. 23. (Ven. Bede) (Worthington)'

David maintained the strictest discipline, and withheld his men from making any disturbance, always manifesting the greatest respect for the person of the king.

(Calmet) --- Saul had made war upon this king, so that he was more ready to protect David, who departing soon after, by the admonition of Gad, (ver. 5.; Calmet) left those who could not follow him under his care. In the mean time he lived on plunder, taken from the surrounding enemies, (Tostat) and was joined by 200 men from the tribes of Benjamin and of Juda, (1 Paralipomenon xii. 16,) with Amasai, his nephew, by his sister Abigail, at their head.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1SA:25:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Samuel died.</i> The Rabbins say four months before Saul. (Seder, olam 13.) (Tirinus) --- Others believe about two years; and suppose that he was 98 years old, twenty of which he had been judge: (Calmet) Salien says 38, and that he lived seventy-seven years. (Menochius) --- On all these points the learned are divided, chap. vii. 15. They are more unanimous in praising (Haydock) the conduct of this most holy statesman. Grotius compares him with Aristides. (Calmet) --- But he Holy Ghost gives Samuel a far more glorious character, Ecclesiasticus xlvi. 16., &c. (Haydock) --- Both he and his mother are figures of the two testaments. Anna becomes fruitful --- Samuel is substituted in the place of Heli. The sterility of Anna represents the incapacity of the Synagogue, to produce living and virtuous children. She bears Samuel, the figure of Jesus Christ, who reunites in his person the royal and the sacerdotal dignity. But under another point of view, Samuel, how perfect soever, must give place to the more perfect David, the glorious type of Jesus Christ, and thus the Synagogue, notwithstanding all her prerogatives, must yield to the Church. See St. Augustine, de C.[City of God?] xvii. 1, 4. Many of the ancients have looked upon Samuel as the high priest: but the generality have acknowledged that he was only a Levite, (Calmet) or an extraordinary priest, like Moses. (Haydock) --- <i>All Israel,</i> or many from every tribe, assembled to attend his funeral; (Tirinus) and all mourned for him, as they had done for Moses and Aaron. (Salien) --- <i>House,</i> or among his kindred, (Tirinus) in a place which he had chosen for his tomb. This is called <i>the house</i> of the wicked <i>for ever;</i> but the just raise their hopes much higher, and await a more splendid palace above, and a glorious resurrection. (Haydock) --- They would not bury Samuel in his dwelling-house, as it could not then be entered without incurring an uncleanness. (Calmet) --- His bones were translated with great respect to Constantinople, and a noble mausoleum was built for them by the emperor Justinian. (Procop. v.; St. Jerome, contra Vigil.) (Tirinus)'
      v:002:
        - '1SA:25:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Maon.</i> Vatican Septuagint has the same word in the preceding verse, instead of Pharan. (Haydock) --- <i>Possessions.</i> Hebrew, "work." Cattle then formed the chief source of riches. Carmel and Maon were not far from Pharan, in Arabia. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - '1SA:25:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Caleb,</i> the famous companion of Josue. His name means, "a dog;" whence the Septuagint, "he was a Cynic." Josephus, "he followed the manners of the Cynics," who were remarkable for their impudence, like dogs. Caleb was of the same tribe as David, and ought to have been more favourable to him on that account, ver. 6. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - "1SA:25:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Molested them.</i> This deserved some acknowledgment, as they might have done it with impunity. But David had also been of service to Nabal's men, as one of them told Abigail, ver. 16---21."
      v:008:
        - '1SA:25:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Good day,</i> set aside for rejoicing, when the sheep were shorn, 2 Kings xiii. 24.'
      v:010:
        - '1SA:25:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Masters.</i> As if he had said, you and David are but fugitive slaves. (Calmet) --- He might also insinuate, that David encouraged such practices, chap. xxii. 2. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - '1SA:25:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Water,</i> under which name all sorts of drink are included. Nabal had plenty of wine, and was much intoxicated, ver. 36. Septuagint translate, "wine." Syriac and Arabic, "drink." --- <i>Cattle.</i> Hebrew, "victim," which is a term used both for sacred and profane feasts.'
      v:014:
        - '1SA:25:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Rejected them.</i> Hebrew, "flew against them." Chaldean, "saw them with disgust."'
      v:017:
        - '1SA:25:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Determined,</i> and as if it had already taken place, chap. xx. 7.'
      v:018:
        - '1SA:25:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Raisins.</i> Hebrew <i>tsimmukim,</i> "dried raisins," or clusters of an extraordinary size. Roger speaks of some gathered in the vale of Sorec, which weighed 25½ pounds. (the year of the Lord 1634.) Septuagint, "a gomer of dry raisins." Syriac and Arabic, "a hundred cheeses." --- <i>Cakes.</i> Chaldean, "pounds." Hebrew is imperfect, two hundred....of figs. We must supply (Calmet) <i>cakes,</i> with the Protestants, &c., or pounds, with the Chaldean, (Haydock) as each of the cakes perhaps weighed so much. (Menochius)'
      v:019:
        - "1SA:25:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Nabal.</i> Knowing his churlish temper, and that he was drunk at this time, (ver. 36.; Haydock) she might be well excused from the ordinary laws which forbid a wife to dispose of her husband's property, without his consent. The emergency left no time for consultation. She gave a part to save the whole. (Calmet)"
      v:020:
        - '1SA:25:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Foot.</i> Hebrew, "in the obscurity," or road covered with trees. Septuagint, "in the shade." Chaldean, "on the side." David was descending from the mountains of Pharan, at the same time.'
      v:022:
        - "1SA:25:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>The enemies,</i> is left out in some editions of the Septuagint. But David wishes all evils to himself, though, to avoid the ominous expression, he specifies his enemies, if he do not punish Nabal. --- <i>Leave.</i> David certainly sinned in his designs against Nabal and his family, as he himself was afterwards sensible, when he blessed God for hindering him from executing the revenge he had proposed. (Challoner) --- <i>All.</i> Chaldean, \"any one who is come to the use of reason.\" Syriac and Arabic, \"the least thing hanging upon the wall.\" I will destroy the guilty, and plunder all the valuable effects. (Calmet) --- But the Hebrew, Septuagint, &c., agree with the Vulgate and the meaning is, either that every <i>man,</i> or that every <i>dog,</i> and even the meanest things, should be enveloped in the general ruin. (Haydock) --- The manners of men vary, but those of dogs are always the same. Hence, it is more generally supposed that this expression (Calmet) denotes that even dogs shall be exterminated, and consequently other things for which Nabal would have a greater affection. (Haydock) --- Aurelian being irritated against the inhabitants of Thiane, swore, \"I will not leave a dog in this town;\" which all people explained as if he meant to leave nothing alive in it. But being afterwards moved with compassion at the distress of the people, he executed his threat literally, and killed all the dogs. (Vopisc.) See 3 Kings xiv. 10., and xv. 29., and xxi. 21., and 4 Kings v. 6. (Bochart, Anim. ii. 55.; Delrio, adag. 184.) (Calmet) --- The unhappy Geddes translates, \"a dog,\" to avoid the indelicate allusion. It would have been well if he had allowed himself no greater liberties! (Haydock) --- The Hebrew <i>mashtin,</i> may denote a shepherd's or a mastiff dog. (Menochius)"
      v:024:
        - "1SA:25:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Iniquity,</i> or the punishment of this fault, ver. 28. (Calmet) --- She wishes to divest the mind of David from the consideration of her husband's incivility; and, after condemning it herself, insinuates that it would be unbecoming for a great king to mind so insignificant an enemy, ver. 28. (Haydock) --- Thus the emperor Adrian, and Louis XII, would not resent the affronts which they had received before they were raised to that high dignity. (Tirinus)"
      v:025:
        - "1SA:25:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>The king,</i> is not in Hebrew, Septuagint, &c. David's title was not yet publicly acknowledged. (Calmet) ---But Abigail plainly alludes to it, ver. 28. (Haydock) --- <i>Name.</i> <i>Nabal,</i> in Hebrew, signifies <i>a fool.</i> (Calmet) --- Thus she extenuates his fault, by attributing it to a deficiency in understanding."
      v:026:
        - '1SA:25:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>To thee.</i> She felicitates David on not having put his design in execution. (Calmet) --- Theodoret thinks he might lawfully have done it; but others believe that the fault bore no proportion with the intended punishment. (Tirinus) --- <i>As Nabal,</i> devoid of sense. Abigail displays the eloquence of nature. (Calmet)'
      v:027:
        - '1SA:25:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Blessing,</i> or present. (Menochius) See 2 Corinthians ix. 5. (Calmet)'
      v:028:
        - '1SA:25:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>House.</i> Thy family shall long continue in the enjoyment of the royal power. Chaldean, "an established kingdom." (Haydock) --- <i>Lord,</i> as his general. --- <i>Evil.</i> Do no manner of injustice. Hebrew, "and evil hast not been found," &c. Hitherto thy life has been irreproachable. (Calmet)'
      v:029:
        - '1SA:25:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Bundle.</i> Such things are more secure than those which are loose. (Worthington) --- <i>Of the living,</i> or predestinate, over whom Providence watches in a particular manner. She seems to allude to the method of carrying pieces of silver in bundles, Proverbs vii. 20. Chaldean, "the soul of my lord shall be in the treasury of the lives of the age, before the Lord God." (Calmet) --- It shall be preserved for length of days, like something most precious, (Haydock) while the wicked shall be in continual danger and anxiety, like a stone in a sling, Zacharias ix. 15. By substituting <i>c</i> for <i>b</i> in Hebrew, the sense may be still more striking: "the soul of my lord shall be preserved like a living (precious, serviceable,) stone. But the soul of thy enemies shall be whirled in a sling." The Hebrews had a great esteem for slingers, so that this comparison would be sufficiently noble. A living stone is often mentioned both is sacred and in profane authors, 1 Peter ii. 4. (Virgil, Æneid i. 171.) <i>Vivoque sedilia saxo.</i>'
      v:030:
        - '1SA:25:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Israel,</i> a thing which all expected, and even Saul himself, chap. xxiv. 21.'
      v:031:
        - "1SA:25:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Scruple.</i> Hebrew, \"scandal,\" or sin, for David might defend himself, but ought not to attack or take revenge, like a king. (Grotius) --- <i>Innocent.</i> Many of Nabal's family were such, and even his fault did not deserve death. Hebrew, \"shed blood without cause.\" (Calmet) --- <i>Handmaid,</i> who has suggested this good advice. (Menochius) --- David was so much pleased with her prudence and beauty, that he afterwards married her."
      v:032:
        - '1SA:25:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Speech.</i> Hebrew, "advice, <i>or</i> wisdom." Septuagint, "conduct." (Calmet)'
      v:035:
        - '1SA:25:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Face.</i> I have been pleased with thy coming, and granted thy request. (Haydock) --- David had sworn with too much haste. (Calmet) --- "It is sometimes wrong to perform what has been promised, and to keep an oath." (St. Ambrose, Off. i. C. ult.[last chapter])'
      v:036:
        - '1SA:25:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Morning.</i> Admirable pattern of discretion, and how reprimands may be made with advantage. (Calmet) --- A medicine given at an improper time often does harm. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xvii. 27.) When a person said to Cleostratus, "Are you not ashamed to get drunk?" he replied, "Are you not ashamed to rebuke a drunken man?"'
      v:037:
        - "1SA:25:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Stone.</i> Stupified at the thought of the imminent danger to which he had foolishly exposed himself. So the poets represent Niobe as metamorphosed into a stone, at hearing of her children's death. (Tirinus) --- Josephus intimates that Nabal was killed by the malignant influence of the stars, <i>sideratus.</i> (Antiquities, vi. 14.) Thus, says he, David \"learnt that no wicked person can escape the vengeance of God, and that Providence does not neglect human affairs, and abandon them to chance.\""
      v:039:
        - '1SA:25:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Blessed be,</i> &c. David praises God on this occasion, not out of joy for the death of Nabal, (which would have argued a rancour of heart) but because he saw that God had so visibly taken his cause in hand, in punishing the injury done to him; whilst, by a merciful providence, he kept him from revenging himself. (Challoner) (Psalm lvii. 10.)'
      v:041:
        - "1SA:25:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Thy servant.</i> She speaks to David's representatives, as if he had been present. (Haydock) --- The marriage was proposed probably a month or two after the death of Nabal; and Abigail followed the messengers, in a short time. (Menochius)"
      v:043:
        - "1SA:25:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Took,</i> or \"had taken before,\" according to Josephus. Hence she is placed first, (Calmet) as the mother of David's first-born, Amnon, 2 Kings iii. 2. (Menochius) --- Michol, whom he married first, had no children. (Haydock) --- <i>Jezrahel,</i> a city of Juda. (Menochius) (Josue xv. 56.) --- There was another more famous place of this name is Issachar."
      v:044:
        - '1SA:25:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>Phalti,</i> or Phaltiel, 2 Kings iii. 15. Saul violated all laws by so doing, and David took her back when he came to the throne, which he could not have done if he had given her a bill of divorce, Deuteronomy xxiv. 4. (Calmet) --- Michol was not blameless in living thus with another man. (Menochius) --- The Rabbins say that a sword hindered Phalti from approaching her. (Horn in Sulp.) --- <i>Gallim,</i> a city of Benjamin, Isaias x. 30. (Calmet)'

      v:002: '1SA:25:2 | 2 | 2 | Now there was a certain man in the wilderness of Maon, and his possessions were in Carmel, and the man was very great: and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and it happened that he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.'
      v:003: '1SA:25:3 | 3 | 3 | Now the name of the man was Nabal: and the name of his wife was Abigail. And she was a prudent and very comely woman, but her husband was churlish, and very bad and ill natured: and he was of the house of Caleb.'
      v:004: '1SA:25:4 | 4 | 4 | And when David heard in the wilderness, that Nabal was shearing his sheep,'
      v:005: '1SA:25:5 | 5 | 5 | He sent ten young men, and said to them: Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and salute him in my name with peace.'
      v:006: '1SA:25:6 | 6 | 6 | And you shall say: Peace be to my brethren, and to thee, and peace to thy house, and peace to all that thou hast.'
      v:007: '1SA:25:7 | 7 | 7 | I have heard that thy shepherds that were with us in the desert were shearing: we never molested them, neither was there ought missing to them of the flock at any time, all the while they were with us in Carmel.'
      v:008: '1SA:25:8 | 8 | 8 | Ask thy servants, and they will tell thee. Now therefore let thy servants find favour in thy eyes: for we are come in a good day, whatsoever thy hand shall find give to thy servants, and to thy son David.'
      v:009: "1SA:25:9 | 9 | 9 | And when David's servants came, they spoke to Nabal all these words in David's name, and then held their peace."
      v:010: '1SA:25:10 | 10 | 10 | But Nabal answering the servants of David, said: Who is David? and what is the son of Isai? servants are multiplied now a days who flee from their masters.'
      v:011: '1SA:25:11 | 11 | 11 | Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and the flesh of my cattle, which I have killed for my shearers, and give to men whom I know not whence they are?'
      v:012: '1SA:25:12 | 12 | 12 | So the servants of David went back their way, and returning came and told him all the words that he said.'
      v:013: '1SA:25:13 | 13 | 13 | Then David said to his young men: Let every man gird on his sword. And they girded on every man his sword. And David also girded on his sword: and there followed David about four hundred men, and two hundred remained with the baggage.'
      v:014: '1SA:25:14 | 14 | 14 | But one of the servants told Abigail, the wife of Nabal, saying: Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness, to salute our master: and he rejected them.'
      v:015: '1SA:25:15 | 15 | 15 | These men were very good to us, and gave us no trouble: neither did we ever lose any thing all the time that we conversed with them in the desert.'
      v:016: '1SA:25:16 | 16 | 16 | They were a wall unto us, both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.'
      v:017: '1SA:25:17 | 17 | 17 | Wherefore consider, and think what thou hast to do: for evil is determined against thy husband, and against thy house, and he is a son of Belial, so that no man can speak to him.'
      v:018: '1SA:25:18 | 18 | 18 | Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves, and two vessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of dry figs, and laid them upon asses:'
      v:019: '1SA:25:19 | 19 | 19 | And she said to her servants: Go before me: behold I will follow after you: but she told not her husband, Nabal.'
      v:020: '1SA:25:20 | 20 | 20 | And when she had gotten upon an ass, and was coming down to the foot of the mountain, David and his men came down over against her, and she met them.'
      v:021: '1SA:25:21 | 21 | 21 | And David said: Truly in vain have I kept all that belonged to this fellow in the wilderness, and nothing was lost of all that pertained unto him: and he hath returned me evil for good.'

      v:023: '1SA:25:23 | 23 | 23 | And when Abigail saw David, she made haste and lighted off the ass, and fell before David, on her face, and adored upon the ground.'
      v:024: '1SA:25:24 | 24 | 24 | And she fell at his feet, and said: Upon me let this iniquity be, my lord: let thy handmaid speak, I beseech thee, in thy ears: and hear the words of thy servant.'
      v:025: '1SA:25:25 | 25 | 25 | Let not my lord the king, I pray thee, regard this naughty man, Nabal: for according to his name, he is a fool, and folly is with him: but I, thy handmaid, did not see thy servants, my lord, whom thou sentest.'

      v:036: "1SA:25:36 | 36 | 36 | And Abigail came to Nabal: and behold he had a feast in his house, like the feast of a king: and Nabal's heart was merry, for he was very drunk: and she told him nothing less or more until morning."
      v:037: '1SA:25:37 | 37 | 37 | But early in the morning, when Nabal had digested his wine, his wife told him these words, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.'
      v:038: '1SA:25:38 | 38 | 38 | And after ten days had passed, the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.'
      v:039: '1SA:25:39 | 39 | 39 | And when David had heard that Nabal was dead, he said: Blessed be the Lord, who hath judged the cause of my reproach, at the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil, and the Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his head. Then David sent and treated with Abigail, that he might take her to himself for a wife.'
      v:040: "1SA:25:40 | 40 | 40 | And David's servants came to Abigail, to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying: David hath sent us to thee, to take thee to himself for a wife."
      v:041: '1SA:25:41 | 41 | 41 | And she arose, and bowed herself down with her face to the earth, and said: Behold, let thy servant be a handmaid, to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.'

      v:009:
        - '1SA:26:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Guiltless.</i> Saul was still his king, how wicked soever, and this title rendered his person inviolable. The eastern nations are very seldom guilty of rebellion, or of murdering their kings; a thing of which we find so many examples in the Roman, English, and French histories. (Calmet) --- A private man could not lay violent hands upon the king without a crime; and therefore David represses Abisai, and commits his cause to God, chap. xxiv. 13. (Menochius) --- He will not permit any one to destroy the life of the king, though he was already anointed to succeed him. (Worthington)'

        - '1SA:26:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Israel.</i> This was a cutting irony. (Calmet) --- Salien attributes to it the enmity which Abner bore to David for above seven years. (Menochius)'

What in effect did not those deserve who wished to make David adore false gods? (Calmet) --- <i>Lord</i> in the land of Israel. --- <i>Gods.</i> They said so, at least by their actions. (Menochius) --- All other countries were in a manner abandoned to idol-worship, so that a person could not dwell in them, without the most imminent danger. See 2 Kings xiv. 16., and Psalm lxxxiii. 12. (Calmet)'

      v:008: '1SA:26:8 | 8 | 8 | And Abisai said to David: God hath shut up thy enemy this day into thy hands: now then I will run him through with my spear, even to the earth at once, and there shall be no need of a second time.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1SA:27:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Hands.</i> God requires that we should act with prudence. (Du Hamel) --- David probably consulted the Lord, and sent ambassadors to Achis, before he went into his dominions, (Menochius) where he had been in such danger before. (Du Hamel)'
      v:002:
        - '1SA:27:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Maoch,</i> or <i>Maacha,</i> 3 Kings ii. 29. This king had perhaps seen David, when he counterfeited madness. But now he was convinced that, by granting him protection, he would greatly annoy Saul, and draw many brave men out of his dominions.'
      v:003:
        - '1SA:27:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Household.</i> They were aware of the cruelty of Saul. The names of these valiant men are specified, 1 Paralipomenon xii. 1., &c.'
      v:005:
        - '1SA:27:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Country,</i> less peopled, and more remote from the sea. --- <i>With thee.</i> David was attended like a king, so that he wished to avoid giving umbrage to Achis, and, at the same time, keep his own men at a greater distance from the contagious morals of the idolaters.'
      v:006:
        - '1SA:27:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Day.</i> This was written some time after the death of Samuel. --- <i>Siceleg</i> belonged at first to Juda, and was afterwards given to the tribe of Simeon, till it fell into the hands of the Philistines, and being restored by them to David, was considered afterwards as the property of the kings of Juda. It lay not far from Horma, Josue xix. 4.'
      v:007:
        - '1SA:27:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Months.</i> Hebrew, "days and four months." The former expression denotes a year; though some would have it, that David remained "four months and a few days" in the country. He probably continued so many months at Geth, (ver. 9, 11,) and about a year at Siceleg. (Calmet) --- Septuagint have "days, four months;" and Salien adopts that term. (Haydock) See chap. xxix. 3. (Du Hamel)'
      v:008:
        - "1SA:27:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Pillaged Gessuri,</i> &c. These probably were enemies of the people of God; and some, if not all of them, were of the number of those whom God had ordered to be destroyed; which justifies David's proceedings in their regard. Though it is to be observed here, that we are not under an obligation of justifying every thing that he did: for the Scripture, in relating what was done, doth not say that it was <i>well</i> done. And even such as are true servants of God, are not to be imitated in all they do. (Challoner) --- The nations of Chanaan, who inhabited as far as Egypt, and the Amalecites, who had escaped the arms of Saul, were devoted to destruction, Exodus xvii., &c. In such cases, any man might fall upon them, without any other formal declaration of war. (Calmet) --- There was another <i>Gessuri</i> of Syria, in the tribe of Manasses, across the Jordan. (Menochius) --- The country which these people inhabited, to the south of Palestine, was afterwards depopulated by the kings of Egypt and of Syria, in their continual wars, so that many of the cities which are mentioned in Scripture, were never known to profane geographers. (Calmet) --- St. Jerome, (Trad.) Sa, and others, think that David attacked some of the Philistines. But it is as probable at least that he would abstain from molesting them, who had so generously afforded him an asylum. Salien concludes, that he did not attack the other nations, (except the Amalecites, who were sufficiently marked out for destruction, Deuteronomy xxv. 19,) without consulting the Lord, by the high priest, as he was accustomed to do in every difficulty. (Salien, the year of the world 2979) (Menochius) --- They all dwelt in part of the land of Chanaan, (Worthington) which was sufficient. (Haydock)"

The words of David might signify that he attacked these people of Israel, as Achis understood him; or that he made inroads upon those who dwelt to the south of them, which was really the case. (Haydock) --- At his return, he passed by Siceleg, where he left the spoil, carrying some of the choicest things, as a present, to Achis. (Menochius) --- But he suffered none of the human race to be carried away captive, lest any of them might disclose the true state of affairs to the king, who might have apprehended that the injured nations would make an attack upon his dominions. (Salien)'
      v:012:
        - '1SA:27:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Harm.</i> Hebrew, "he hath made himself stinking (an object of horror) to his people." A strong expression used, Genesis xxxiv. 30., and Exodus v. 21. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "he is quite covered with confusion." Achis supposed that David had thus forfeited all his pretensions to dwell among, much less, to reign over Israel: so that he might keep him always in his service. (Haydock) --- In the mean time, Saul was exterminating the people of Gabaon, which brought a pestilence on Israel, 40 years after. (Theodoret) --- He perhaps supposed that the oath of Josue had not been yet put in execution, as it ought to be, herein indulging too much his cruel temper. (Salien)'

(Dickenson, c. 9.) --- Brodeus mentions that the valet of Francis I could thus counterfeit the speech of people deceased, and by these means prevailed upon a rich young woman to marry him, and a banker of Lyons to give him a large sum of money. James Rodoginus, a possessed person in Italy, 1513, could make articulate sounds from the hollow of his belly, when his lips and nostrils were closed up.

(Salien) --- Theodoret follows their opinion, in supposing that the woman was startled, because Samuel appeared in a standing posture, and not with his feet upwards, or lying down on his back, as in a coffin, which they say (Calmet) is the usual manner of spirits appearing to people of her character. (Bellarmine, Purgat. ii. 6.) --- She <i>cried out,</i> because he appeared before she had begun her incantations, and was arrayed like a priest, according to Josephus, (Haydock) in great majesty, or she pretended to see him, the better to impose upon the king; for some think that all was a delusion.

      v:014:
        - "1SA:28:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Understood that it was Samuel.</i> It is the more common opinion of the holy fathers, and interpreters, that the soul of Samuel appeared indeed; and not, as some have imagined, an evil spirit in his shape. Not that the power of her magic could bring him thither, but that God was pleased for the punishment of Saul, that Samuel himself should denounce unto him the evils that were falling upon him. See Ecclesiasticus xlvi. 23. (Challoner) --- The passage is decisive; (Tirinus) <i>he slept and he made known to the king, and shewed him the end of his life, and he lifted up his voice from the earth, in prophecy,</i> &c. Those who have called in question the reality of Samuel's apparition, seem not to have remembered this passage. (Haydock) --- Yet his soul was not united to his body, (Salien) nor was he adduced by the power of the devil, but (Du Hamel) by a just judgment of God, to denounce destruction to the wicked king. (St. Augustine, &c.) (Tirinus) --- The woman, beholding Samuel, fled out of the place, to Saul's companions, and left him alone with the king, ver. 21. --- <i>Adored</i> Samuel with an inferior honour, as the friend of God, exalted in glory. (Salien) --- That Samuel really appeared, is the more common opinion of the fathers. (St. Augustine, Cura. xv.) (Worthington)"

(Haydock) --- The Scripture language conforms itself to the opinions of the people, who thought that such avocations disturbed the soul's repose. Hence the fathers at [the Synod of] Elvira (Canon xxxi.) forbid \"the lighting of wax candles in church-yards during the day, for the spirits of the saints are not to be disquieted.\" Isaias (xiv. 9,) represents hell all in commotion, at the approach of the king of Babylon. These expressions are figurative.

      v:024:
        - '1SA:30:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Alike.</i> Nothing could be more just and prudent; as this decision prevents continual murmurs and inconveniences. Those who are left behind, are bound to defend the baggage at the hazard of their lives, and each man must obey the orders of the general. Hence all nations seem to have adopted similar regulations, though Achilles declaims against it. (Homer, Iliad i.) --- Coriolanus observes, that formerly the Romans brought all the spoil into the public treasury. (Halicar. vii.) --- The soldiers promised on oath to bring all they should take, and an equal division was made to the whole army. (Polyb. x.) --- The sick and absent also partook of the plunder. (Calmet) --- The same was observed by the Machabees, 2 Machabees viii. 28. (Haydock)'
      v:025:
        - '1SA:30:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>A law.</i> Custom, (Calmet) and a particular injunction, had long before made way for it, Numbers xxxi. 27, (Haydock) and Josue xxii. 8. --- We might translate the Hebrew, "And this law had been observed in Israel from that day and before." David restored to its full vigour this ancient regulation. The Hebrews have no compound verbs, such as re-establish, re-build, &c., instead of which, they say, to establish, (Calmet) and build again. Thus, by the addition of adverbs, they can explain the same things. Protestants, "from that day forward he made it a statute," &c. (Haydock) --- It is not, therefore, unlawful to make new laws, provided they be conformable to those of God, Deuteronomy iv., and xii. (Worthington)'

        - '1SA:30:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Neighbours.</i> Hebrew, "friends;" some were at a distance, ver. 28. (Haydock) --- The number of presents shews the quantity of the spoil, and the generosity of David towards those who had formerly assisted him. (Calmet)'

        - "1SA:31:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Fled.</i> They make but a feeble resistance, as God was not with them. (Haydock) --- The first onset was made by the archers, and Saul's three sons fell, while the king himself was dangerously wounded. (Calmet) --- The death of his sons would increase his anguish. (Menochius) --- He seems not to have told them of the divine decree, as he might deem it irrevocable and unavoidable, so that flight would have been of no service to them. (Haydock)"

        - '1SA:31:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Overtook.</i> Hebrew, "attacked, found, <i>or</i> hit him." He was running away. (Haydock) --- <i>Wounded.</i> Some translate Hebrew, "terrified," as they believe the words of the Amalecite, "my whole life is in me." But that wretch deserves no credit; and Saul would probably not take the desperate resolution of killing himself, till he saw there was no possibility of escaping. Septuagint, "the archers find him, and they wounded him in the lower belly." Theodotion, "in the part near the liver."'
      v:004:
        - "1SA:31:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Bearer.</i> The Rabbins say he was Doeg. They were not yet come to a close engagement. --- <i>Mock at me,</i> as was then customary.

      v:005:
        - '1SA:31:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>With him.</i> Thus to avoid a little shame and temporal punishment, they rushed into those which are inconceivably geat and eternal. (Haydock) --- The Jews in vain attempt to excuse Saul, as they deem suicide in such cases lawful, though in others they deprive those of burial, who have been guilty of it. (Josephus, Antiquities vi. 14.) --- This author applauds the behaviour of Saul; and indeed, his courage called forth the praises of David. But even the pagans have deemed those no better than cowards, who have killed themselves to avoid misery.{JOIN}{BQ:2}Rebus in adversis facile est contemnere mortem:{JOIN}{BQ:2}Fortiter ille facit, qui miser esse potest. (Martial){JOIN}The civil laws deny suicides the rites of burial, as they are also guilty of a crime against the state, which they deprive of their labours. They unjustly abandon what God has only committed to their care. Saul seems to have been afraid of receiving any insult himself, rather than to have been desirous of preventing the blasphemies of the infidels against God, as the Jews pretend. He gave no signs of repentance, and the spirit of God pronounces his condemnation. <i>So Saul died for his iniquities, because he transgressed;</i> (Calmet; Hebrew and Septuagint, in his iniquities, by which he prevaricated. Tirinus)...<i>and moreover consulted also a witch, and trusted not in the Lord: therefore he slew him,</i> 1 Paralipomenon x. 13, 14. Saul prefigured those, who having yielded to temptations, persist and die in their evil ways. (St. Gregory) (Worthington)'

        - '1SA:31:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>His men.</i> 1 Paralipomenon x. 6., <i>his house fell together.</i> The hopes of his family were at an end, (Haydock) though Isboseth, Abner, and some few survived him, (Menochius) who had fled, (Calmet) or had not been in the engagement. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - '1SA:31:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Beyond,</i> or about "the passage" or fords of the Jordan, as the Hebrew means. (Menochius) --- The Philistines did not pursue after them, as God set bounds to their ambition. It might otherwise have proved very fatal to his people, who were now so much divided and terrified. In the parallel passage, in Chronicles, it is only said, <i>When the men....that dwelt in the plains</i> (of Jezrahel) <i>saw this, they fled,</i> 1 Paralipomenon x. 7. The Philistines seized the abandoned cities, particularly Bethsan, (ver. 10.; Haydock) which had been retained by the Chanaanites in the days of the judges, and which David took back, Judges i. 27., and 3 Kings iv. 12.'

The Philistines insulted Saul's body, and blasphemed the true God, as much as if they had taken the king alive. He only avoided the mortification of hearing them while he was forced to attend to the furies below. --- <i>Body,</i> with those of his three sons, ver. 12. (Haydock) --- Saul's head was hung up in the temple of Dagon, at Azotus; (1 Paralipomenon x. 10,) his body was suspended on the <i>wall</i> or <i>street of Bethsan;</i> (2 Kings xxi. 12,) or in the most public place, near the gate of the city."

      v:012:
        - '1SA:31:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Burnt them,</i> or the flesh, reserving the ashes and bones to be buried, as was customary among the Greeks (Homer, {GREEK:START ps}ψ{GREEK:END}.) and Romans:{JOIN}{BQ:2}-----<i>Sed cænam funeris hœres</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Negliget iratus quod rem curtaveris; urnæ</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Ossa inodora dabit.</i> (Persius. vi.){JOIN}See Amos vi. 10.

(Salien) --- There was no obligation of mourning for the kings, though it is probable that those near the royal city, would shew this mark of attention to the deceased monarch. See Jeremias xxxiv. 5., and 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 25. The usual term of mourning was seven days, Ecclesiasticus xxii. 13. (Calmet) --- It is very difficult to ascertain the length of Saul's reign. Sanctius and Tirinus allow him only 2 years; Petau 12; Calvisius 15; Salien 18; Bucholeer, and probably Josephus 20, though most copies of the latter have 38; St. Augustine, Serarius, Usher, &c., 40, which is the term mentioned [in] Acts xiii. 20. But most chronologers suppose that the time of Samuel's administration is there also included. (Haydock) --- Sulpitius thinks that Saul only \"reigned a very short time,\" as \"the ark was brought to Cariathiarim before he appeared on the throne, and was removed by David, after it had been there twenty years.\""

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - 'This and the following Book are called by the Hebrews, the Books of Samuel, because they contain the history of Samuel, and of the two kings, Saul and David, whom he anointed. They are more commonly named by the Fathers, the First and Second Book of Kings. As to the writer of them, it is the common opinion that Samuel composed the first book, as far as the twenty-fifth chapter; and that the prophets Nathan and Gad finished the first and wrote the second book. See 1 Paralipomenon, alias 1 Chronicles, xxix. 19. (Challoner) --- The authors of the Third and Fourth Books of Kings were also prophets, but we know not exactly their names. These works have nevertheless been always esteemed authentic (Haydock) and canonical. (Worthington) --- Ven. Bede takes occasion to observe, from the Books of Kings (or as the Septuagint read, "of kingdoms;" Haydock) being placed after that of Judges, that the everlasting kingdom of Christ will succeed the general judgment. The translation of the priesthood and of the regal dignity, recorded in these books, denote also that Christ would united both in his own person; as the two wives of Elcana intimated, that both Jews and Gentiles would acknowledge the same Lord. (St. Jerome; St. Augustine; &c.) --- The transactions of Heli, Samuel and Saul, and the persecutions which David sustained from the latter, form the subject of the first book, (Haydock) during the space of 100 years. All the four books carry down the sacred history near 600 years, from the year of the world 2849 till the transmigration of Juda, in the year 3420. (Calmet) (Usher)'
