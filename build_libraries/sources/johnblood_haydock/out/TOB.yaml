    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "TOB:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Tobias,</i> \"good God,\" (Tirinus) is styled Tobis, by the ancient Latin version and St. Ambrose, and Tobit by the Greek and Syriac. These copies and the Hebrew give a genealogy which does not agree. (Calmet) --- Grabe's edition, \"The book of the words (or transactions) of Tobit, Son of Tobiel, son of Ananiel, son of Adouel, (manuscript has Nave) son of Galael, (manuscript, Gamael) of the seed of Asiel, of the tribe of Nephthali, (<b>2</b>) who was made captive in the days of Enemessar, king of the Assyrians, from Thisbe, (manuscript, Thibe) which is on the right properly (manuscript, of Kudis; Haydock) or Cades, capital (Calmet) of Nephthali in Galilee, above Aser. I, Tobit, walked in the ways of truth and of justice all the days of my life.\" (Haydock) --- Nehemias and the prophets frequently speak of themselves in the first person. The truth of the history is the same. (Du Hamel) --- <i>Beyond,</i> or behind; (<i>post;</i> Haydock) as the Hebrews speak with reference to a man turned towards the east. Hence this <i>way</i> would be on the west, and <i>Sephet</i> on the north."
      v:002:
        - 'TOB:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Salmanasar.</i> When Osee was conquered, in the year of the world 3283. See 4 Kings xvii. 6. --- <i>Truth.</i> His constancy in the observance of the true religion was so much the more wonderful, as he was rich, and lived among the wicked. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'TOB:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Kindred.</i> Greek adds, "who went along with me....to Ninive."'
      v:004:
        - 'TOB:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Younger.</i> "Very young," (Haydock) or the youngest of those who administered their own affairs. The parents of Tobias were deceased. (Calmet) --- Greek, "when I was young in my country, in the land of Israel, all the tribe," &c.'
      v:005:
        - 'TOB:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>All,</i> or the greatest part; (Haydock) for some still feared God; (chap. ii. 2.; Worthington) and the Greek of chap. v. 14 or 19 informs us that Ananias and Jonathan accompanied Tobias. (Haydock) --- Greek is more diffuse. (Calmet) --- (<b>4</b>) "All the tribe of Nephthali, of my father, departed from the house of Jerusalem, which city had been chosen from all the tribes of Israel, for all the tribes to offer sacrifice; and the temple of the tabernacle of the most High was sanctified, and was built for ever; (<b>5</b>) and all the tribes, apostatizing together, sacrificed to Baal, to the heifer; (Comp. ed., to the power of Baal) and the house of Nephthali, of my father, <i>likewise.</i> (<b>6</b>) And I alone went frequently to Jerusalem, at the feasts" (Haydock) of the Passover, &e. (Menochius) --- The other versions are nearly similar. (Calmet) --- But we cannot specify all these variations. (Haydock) --- The number has induced some to conclude, not improbably, that there were two originals; (Tirinus) the Syriac by the elder, and the Chaldee by the younger Tobias. (Justiniani.) --- But this is destitute of proof. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - "TOB:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Strangers.</i> See Deuteronomy xiv. 28., (Menochius) Leviticus xxvii. 30. (Calmet) --- Greek, \"And the third I gave to whom it belonged, as Debbora, my father's mother, ordered me, as I was left an orphan by my father; (<b>9</b>) and when I was,\" &c. (Haydock)"
      v:009:
        - 'TOB:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Man.</i> The Jews married young: but the time was not fixed. (Calmet) --- <i>After.</i> Greek, "Tobias." They always style the father Tobit. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'TOB:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Ninive,</i> called Ninus by Pliny, &c. (Menochius) --- It was so large, as easily to receive a whole <i>tribe,</i> which was sold for slaves. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'TOB:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Meats,</i> such as had been immolated to idols, (Menochius) or were forbidden to the Jews. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'TOB:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>And he.</i> Greek, "I was his marketter," (Haydock) to provide provisions for the palace. "He set me over all he had, till the day of his death." (Munster.) --- But this Hebrew author has probably exaggerated the matter, to make Tobias appear as great as he could. These editions add no more, continuing, (<b>15</b>) "And I went into Media, and I deposited with Gabael, or Gabelus," &c.'
      v:016:
        - 'TOB:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Rages</i> means "rupture," by frequent earthquakes, and was (Menochius; Calmet) the residence of the Parthian kings, in spring, (Athen. xii. 2.) in the mountain, separating their country from Media. --- <i>Honoured</i> for his salary. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'TOB:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Money.</i> People might formerly make use of what was merely deposited in their hands. (Ulpian.) --- The old Latin version has, "I committed <i>to him</i> ten talents in gold."'
      v:018:
        - 'TOB:1:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Time.</i> Salmanasar reigned fourteen years; seven after the captivity, which to people in distress would appear <i>long.</i> (Calmet) --- Greek, "And after Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib, his son, reigned in his stead; and his ways ceased, (or his high roads were stopped) and I could no longer go into Media." (Haydock) --- We find nothing in history to confirm this stoppage: (Calmet) but it might be in consequence of the wars. (Houbigant) See the preface. (Haydock) --- <i>Israel.</i> This hatred was augmented, after the unfortunate expedition into Palestine. (Calmet) (Menochius) (4 Kings xix. 35.)'
      v:019:
        - 'TOB:1:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Goods,</i> under Sennacherib; though he was now deprived of his place. (Calmet) --- Greek, Syriac, and Hebrew insinuate, that this happened under his predecessor. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'TOB:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Slain,</i> by order or connivance of Sennacherib. (Menochius) --- Tobias buried the dead, out of charity, and the belief of a future resurrection. Hence arises the respect for tombs and the relics of the saints. (Calmet) --- The pagans imagined that the souls could not rest till their bodies were interred. (Homer, Virgil vii., &c.) (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - 'TOB:1:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Loved him,</i> even of the Assyrians. The Jews were not able to afford him shelter. (Menochius)'
      v:024:
        - 'TOB:1:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Forty.</i> Arabic, twenty-five; Greek and Syriac, fifty; other Greek copies, fifty-five days. Fagius says Tobias was hidden nineteen days. It seems, therefore, we should date these forty-five days from the return of Sennacherib. --- <i>Sons.</i> See 4 Kings xix. 37., and Isaias xxxvii. 38. (Calmet) --- Greek adds, "and they fled to the mountains of Ararat, and Sacherdoc, (our Assaraddon) his son, reigned in his stead; and he appointed Achiachar Anael, the son of my brother, over all the accounts of his kingdom, and over all his government. And Achiachar petitioned for me; and I came to Ninive. But Achiachar was cup-bearer, (Alexandrian manuscript, receiver of wine) and keeper of the ring, and governor and keeper of accounts; and Sacherdonosos gave him the second place. But he was my nephew. And when I returned to my house, and my wife Anna, and my son Tobias, were restored to me, at the feast of Pentecost," &c. (Haydock) --- This seems contrary to ver. 23. Yet the Hebrew copies agree in this particular, and mention the dignity of Akikar. But we may judge what credit these additions deserve. (Calmet) --- They merit some attention, as they may be original. See Preface. (Haydock)'

      v:002: 'TOB:1:2 | 2 | 2 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}When he was made captive in the days of Salmanasar, king of the Assyrians, even in his captivity, forsook not the way of truth,'

      v:006: 'TOB:1:6 | 6 | 6 | And went to Jerusalem, to the temple of the Lord, and there adored the Lord God of Israel, offering faithfully all his first-fruits, and his tithes.'

      v:012: 'TOB:1:12 | 12 | 12 | (When all ate of the meats of the Gentiles) he kept his soul, and never was defiled with their meats.'
      v:013: 'TOB:1:13 | 13 | 13 | And because he was mindful of the Lord with all his heart, God gave him favour in the sight of Salmanasar, the king.'
      v:014: 'TOB:1:14 | 14 | 14 | And he gave him leave to go whithersoever he would, with liberty to do whatever he had a mind.'
      v:015: 'TOB:1:15 | 15 | 15 | He, therefore, went to all that were in captivity, and gave them wholesome admonitions.'
      v:016: 'TOB:1:16 | 16 | 16 | And when he was come to Rages, a city of the Medes, and had ten talents of silver of that with which he had been honoured by the king:'

      v:018: 'TOB:1:18 | 18 | 18 | But after a long time, Salmanasar, the king, being dead, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}when Sennacherib, his son, who reigned in his place, had a hatred for the children of Israel:'
      v:019: 'TOB:1:19 | 19 | 19 | Tobias daily went among all his kindren, and comforted them, and distributed to every one as he was able, out of his goods:'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'TOB:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>House.</i> The law authorized such feasts, Deuteronomy xii. 12, and xiv. 28. Tobias complied with it, by inviting also the poor servants of God. Greek, "I lay down to eat." This custom prevailed in the East. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'TOB:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Tribe.</i> Greek, "brethren indigent, and who remembers God." (Haydock) --- All had not given way to idolatry. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - 'TOB:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Street.</i> Asarhaddon did not protect the Israelites, which renders the elevation of Akikar to the highest dignities suspicious. (Calmet) --- But the king and his minister might not be able to prevent all murders. (Haydock) --- <i>Fasting.</i> The ancients seldom eat anything before noon. Greek, "Before I had tasted, I leaped up and took him to a house, till the sun should be set," (Haydock) to prevent any danger from the Assyrians. (Menochius) --- lf he did not employ another, he must have eaten alone, being rendered unclean. This seems to have been the case; and hence he did not enter his own house, but lay down by the wall. (Calmet) --- Greek and Hebrew mention, that he washed himself before he eat. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'TOB:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>But.</i> This version is not in Greek or Hebrew. (Calmet) --- True zeal is not repressed by fear, as charity expels it, 1 John iv. (Worthington)'
      v:010:
        - 'TOB:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Now.</i> Greek, "And that very night I was." --- <i>He came.</i> Greek, "I lay myself down, being defiled, beside the wall of the court, and my face was uncovered." (Haydock) --- The touching the dead rendered a person unclean, Numbers xix. 11.'
      v:011:
        - "TOB:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Swallow's.</i> Greek denotes \"sparrows,\" or any other small birds: {GREEK:START strouthia}στρουθια{GREEK:END}. (Serarius) --- <i>Eyes.</i> Greek observes that they were \"opened.\" Hebrew, \"by chance.\" Yet \"hares, and many men, sleep with their eyes open,\" (Pliny [Natural History?] xi. 37.) as was here the case. (St. Athanasius, Synops.) --- lf not, the dung might insinuate itself by rubbing. It is extremely caustic. (Vales. 42.; Aldrov.17.; &c.) --- The blindness of Tobias was only a suspension of sight. (Calmet) --- <i>Blind.</i> Greek, \"white <i>specks or skins</i> came upon my eyes, and I went to the physicians, but they afforded me no relief. But Achiachar fed me (Haydock) till I (or he) went to Elymais;\" Hebrew of Fagius, \"into Germany.\" (Calmet) --- <i>Almniim.</i> (Haydock)"
      v:012:
        - 'TOB:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Now.</i> This is omitted in Greek and Hebrew as far as ver. 19. St. Ambrose says beautifully, that Tobias "was more grieved that he could yield no assistance <i>to others,</i> than for the loss of his sight."'
      v:015:
        - "TOB:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Kings.</i> So Job's three friends are here called, because they were princes in their respective territories, (Challoner) like the petty kings of Palestine, in the days of Abraham and of Josue. They are styled kings in the Greek version of Job. (Calmet) --- <i>Relations,</i> (<i>parentes</i>.) His father and mother were dead. (Worthington)"
      v:018:
        - 'TOB:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Saints;</i> Abraham, &c. Thus Mathathias encouraged his children; (1 Machabees ii. 50.) and no argument can be more forcible.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Dice puer virtutem ex me, verumque laborem</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Sis memor, et te animo repetentem exempla tuorum</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Et pater Æneas et avunculus excitet Hector.</i> -----Virgil, Æneid xii.{JOIN}--- <i>Life</i> eternal. These grand truths were more developed, as the Messias was nearer at hand.'
      v:019:
        - 'TOB:2:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Work.</i> This was usually the employment of women. The great charities of Tobias, physicians, &c., had reduced him to poverty.'
      v:020:
        - 'TOB:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Kid,</i> which had not left off sucking. Greek adds, that this was given besides the usual wages. (Menochius)'
      v:021:
        - 'TOB:2:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Theft.</i> He was the master of the family, and knew that there was no money in the house, so that he was not guilty of rash judgment, (Menochius) though his wife might naturally be offended.'
      v:022:
        - 'TOB:2:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>At.</i> Greek, "but she said: It was given to me in addition to my wages. Yet I did not give credit to her, and I ordered her to restore it to its owners; and I blushed for her. But she replied: Where are thy alms-deeds and thy just works? Behold, all things are known with thee. Then, through grief, I wept," &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Hope</i> in God, who nevertheless leaves us in distress. (Menochius) --- She indirectly finds fault with Providence, which increases the grief of Tobias; or, at least, she insinuates that he must have been a hypocrite, as the friends of Job unjustly argued, from his being afflicted. (Haydock)'

      v:004: 'TOB:2:4 | 4 | 4 | And taking it up, carried it privately to his house, that after the sun was down, he might bury him cautiously.'
      v:005: 'TOB:2:5 | 5 | 5 | And when he had hid the body, he ate bread with mourning and fear,'

      v:008: 'TOB:2:8 | 8 | 8 | Now all his neighbours blamed him, saying: Once already commandment was given for thee to be slain because of this matter, and thou didst scarce escape the sentence of death, and dost thou again bury the dead?'
      v:009: 'TOB:2:9 | 9 | 9 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}But Tobias fearing God more than the king, carried off the bodies of them that were slain, and hid them in his house, and at midnight buried them.'

      v:012: 'TOB:2:12 | 12 | 12 | Now this trial the Lord, therefore, permitted to happen to him, that an example might be given to posterity of his patience, as also of holy Job.'
      v:013: 'TOB:2:13 | 13 | 13 | For, whereas, he had always feared God from his infancy, and kept his commandments; he repined not against God, because the evil of blindness had befallen him,'
      v:014: 'TOB:2:14 | 14 | 14 | But continued immoveable in the fear of God, giving thanks to God all the days of his life.'
      v:015: 'TOB:2:15 | 15 | 15 | For as the kings insulted over holy Job, so his relations and kinsmen mocked at his life, saying:'
      v:016: 'TOB:2:16 | 16 | 16 | Where is thy hope, for which thou gavest alms, and buriedst the dead?'
      v:017: 'TOB:2:17 | 17 | 17 | But Tobias rebuked them, saying: Speak not so:'

(Menochius) --- The Scripture frequently seems to indicate that this is the case; (Exodus xx. 5.) and the Church still prays, <i>Remember not, O Lord, our offences, nor those of our parents.</i> (Calmet) --- But children are only punished when they imitate the wicked conduct of their ancestors: they may be afflicted, though innocent, as their virtue will thus be tried, and shine more gloriously. (Haydock) --- The pagans, being convinced that God can be guilty of no injustice, and perceiving that people who appeared to be free from sin were yet unhappy, concluded that they were explaining the sins committed in another world. (Plotin. ii. 13.; Origen, prin. iii.) (Calmet) --- This might arise from a confused notion of original sin. (Pascal's Thoughts.) (Haydock)"
      v:006:
        - 'TOB:3:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Peace.</i> Greek, "that I may be dissolved, and return to the earth; (literally, become earth) because it is more advantageous for me to die than to live, since I have heard false reproaches, and am much grieved. Command that I may be freed from this necessity, <i>to go</i> to my eternal place." (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - 'TOB:3:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Rages.</i> In the Greek it is <i>Ecbatana</i> which was also called Rages. For there were two cities in Media of the name of Rages: Raguel dwelt in one of them and Gabelus in the other. (Challoner; Menochius) --- Profane authors mention a Rages in the vicinity of Ecbatana. (Diod. Bib. 19.) --- It may here denote the province. (Worthington)'
      v:008:
        - 'TOB:3:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Asmodeus,</i> "the fire of Media." Hebrew, "king of the devils," of that country, exciting people to lust, (Menochius; Serarius, q. 8.) and destroying them.

(Grotius) (Calmet) --- But this interpretation is groundless, (Houbigant) and very injurious to Sara. (Haydock) --- She could not entertain the thought without sin. Yet the Jews had very relaxed notions on this head, Judges xvi. 30., and 1Kings xxxi. 4. God approved of the conduct of Sara. (Calmet) --- Greek continues, "and she said, I am the only daughter of my father. If I do this thing, (as the servants suggested) it will be a disgrace for him....and she prayed before the window; and said, Blessed," ver. 13. (Haydock) --- There is no mention of the three days. Hebrew and Syriac also omit ver. 16 to 24. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - 'TOB:3:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Name.</i> Greek, "Blessed art thou O Lord, my God, and blessed the name of thy glory, holy and glorious for ever. May all thy works praise thee for ever." (Haydock) --- As she prayed for a long time, the Vulgate gives some sentences; and the Greek and Hebrew others. (Serarius; Salien) (Menochius)'
      v:015:
        - 'TOB:3:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Earth.</i> Holy men have thus desired to die, as was the case with Moses, Elias, Job, and St. Paul provided God was willing. (Menochius)'

Greek, "I am pure from all the sin of a man, and I have not defiled my name, nor the name of my father, in the land of our captivity. I am an only child, " &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Lust:</i> a very high encomium; which Sara mentions without vanity, placing her confidence in God. (Menochius) (Proverbs xx. 9.)'

      v:009: 'TOB:3:9 | 9 | 9 | So when she reproved the maid for her fault, she answered her, saying: May we never see son, or daughter of thee upon the earth, thou murderer of thy husbands.'

      v:001:
        - 'TOB:4:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>When.</i> Greek and Hebrew and the old Vulgate, (Calmet) "That very day Tobit remembered the money which he had deposited with Gabael....and said within himself, I begged for death; why do I not call Tobias, my son, that I may declare <i>it</i> to him before I die? And calling him, he said: Son, if I die, bury me, and despise not thy mother." (Haydock) --- He gives him fourteen instructions, in imitation of Moses and David, 3 Kings ii. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - 'TOB:4:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Life.</i> St. Augustine (Conf. x. 34) cries out, "O Light, which Tobias had in view, when these <i>corporal</i> eyes being closed, he taught his son the way of life."'
      v:005:
        - 'TOB:4:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>By me.</i> Greek adds, "in the same sepulchre," like the patriarchs. Pope Leo decreed: <i>statuimus unumquemque in sepulchro suorum majorum jacere.</i>'
      v:007:
        - 'TOB:4:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Substance.</i> Be not liberal of another’s property. Greek adds, "and let not thy eye be envious, when thou givest alms." Do it generously. (Calmet) --- The same doctrine of the reward of good works, occurs [in] Daniel iv. 24. (Worthington)'
      v:009:
        - TOB:4:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Little.</i> God regards the affections more than the gift. (Calmet)
      v:011:
        - 'TOB:4:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Sin,</i> provided faith, &c., be not wanting. (Menochius) --- When the Scripture seems to attribute salvation to one virtue, to faith, repentance, &c., it always presupposes that the heart is free from all mortal guilt. (Haydock) --- Alms deeds may procure a fresh supply of graces. (Menochius) --- <i>Darkness,</i> or hell, which is thus represented, Matthew viii. 12., and xxii. 13., and Ephesians vi. 12.'
      v:012:

Severus was so much pleased with it, that he had it often repeated by a herald, and inscribed on public edifices. <i>What thou wouldst not have done to thee, do not thou to another.</i> (Lamprid.) --- Greek and Hebrew add a caution against drunkenness and drunken companions. Fagius has another against revenge; and the old Vulgate, "give not way to wickedness."'
      v:017:
        - 'TOB:4:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Eat.</i> Greek, "give." --- <i>Naked.</i> Greek adds, "give in alms all thy superfluities, and let not thy eye repine," &c., as ver. 7. (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - "TOB:4:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Burial,</i> or sepulchre. See Baruch vi. 26.; Ecclesiasticus vii. 37., and xxx. 18. The Jews followed this custom, which was common to the pagans, but from very different motives. The latter supposed that the souls fed on such meats. The Jews, and afterwards Christians, did it to feed the indigent, that they might pray for the deceased. These feasts were sometimes abused, and on that account forbidden by St. Ambrose, to whose authority St. Monica submitted. (St. Augustine, Conf. vi. 3.) See Constitutions Apostolic viii. 24. (Calmet) --- <i>Just man,</i> who may be supposed to have died in God's peace. (Haydock) --- It is of no service to pray and give alms for the damned. --- <i>Wicked,</i> so as to encourage their evil conduct. (Menochius) --- Works of mercy extend to the dead. (Worthington)"
      v:020:
        - 'TOB:4:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Abide.</i> Greek, "prosper," (Menochius) or "be directed. For every nation has not counsel: but this same Lord bestows all good things. And whensoever he will, he humbles, as he pleases. And now, <i>my</i> son, remember my commands, and let them not be effaced from thy heart. Now, also, I make known unto thee the ten talents of silver, which I deposited with Gabael," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - 'TOB:4:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>And I.</i> The Greek, &c., take no notice of this, (Calmet) nor of the following verse. (Haydock) --- The virtuous dispose of their temporal effects by will, &c. (Worthington)'

(Haydock) --- This angel prefigured Jesus Christ, who took indeed our human nature. (Ven. Bede) (Worthington)'
      v:007:
        - 'TOB:5:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Israel.</i> This is not in Greek, &c. But the old Vulgate has, "Raphael answered, of the children of Israel, thy brethren, I am come hither for work," (Haydock) or employment. (Calmet)'

But he replied, I am of the race of Azarias, and of Ananias, who is also thy brother." Whitaker would have this to be a lie. (Haydock) --- But the apparitions of angels are not to be examined by the ordinary rules of life. They take the name of God without scruple, as they acted in his name, Genesis xxxi. 11. (Calmet; Menochius; Tirinus) --- <i>Azarias.</i> The angel took the form of Azarias; and therefore might call himself by the name of the man whom he personated. Azarias, in Hebrew, signifies <i>the help of God;</i> and Ananias, <i>the grace of God.</i> (Challoner) --- Tobias had not inquired whether he was a man or an angel, as Houbigant answers the objection of Prideaux.

Thou art of a great stock, brother. But tell me what reward I shall give thee? A drachm a day, and what may be requisite for thee and for my son.

      v:001:
        - 'TOB:6:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Dog.</i> Greek and Hebrew specify this circumstance, (chap. v. 22.) but not here. Those who attack the authority of this book, infer that such a trifle would not be noticed by the Holy Spirit, chap. xi. 9. Yet Homer mentions the fawning of the dog upon Ulysses, after he had been 20 years from home; and the gravest historians record instances of the fidelity of dogs. (Calmet) --- <i>Night,</i> or stage, <i>mansione,</i> (Haydock) at a <i>caravansera,</i> or house where travellers might stop all night, and sometimes, though seldom, might be supplied with necessaries. Herodotus (v. 52.) mentions several in the kingdom of Persia. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - "TOB:6:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Feet.</i> Greek, \"to bathe.\" --- <i>Fish.</i> The learned are of opinion that this was the fish which Pliny calls <i>callyonymus,</i> ([Natural History?] l. xxii. ch. 7.) the gall of which is of sovereign virtue to remove white specks that grow over the eyes. (Challoner) --- Other fishes have the like virtue; and as the aforesaid has no scales, and is not above a foot long, it could not be lawfully eaten by the Israelites, nor could it suffice for ten days' provision, ver. 6. (Leviticus xi. 10.) Others, therefore, prefer (Calmet) the sea-calf, (Brado) the hippopotamus, (Grotius) the crocodile, (Denis the Carthusian) whale, (Theophylactus) sturgeon, or <i>silurus.</i> (Bochart, Anim. iv. 15.) --- But there are great difficulties with respect to all these; and Fran. George adopts the sentiment of the Rabbins in favour of the pike, which seems the least objectionable, as it has scales, gills, and cannot live long out of water, ver. 4. It grows to a great size in the Tigris, and its gall is good for the eyes. (Calmet)"
      v:003:
        - TOB:6:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>And.</i> This verse is not in Greek. Tobias and the fish were both in the water. (Calmet)
      v:004:
        - 'TOB:6:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Take him.</i> "It," would be as proper. --- <i>Gill.</i> Greek, "Seize the fish, and the boy got the better of the fish, and threw it upon the land." (Haydock) --- Hebrew also omits the gill and the panting, (Calmet) circumstances which would invalidate the opinions of many respecting the nature of this fish, v. ii.[ver. 2.?] (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - 'TOB:6:5 | 5 | 5 | For thee. Greek, "carefully." (Haydock) --- The rest is omitted also in the Hebrew of Fagius. (Calmet)'

(Worthington) --- <i>Took.</i> Greek and Fagius, (Calmet) \"eat, and both went on till they came near to Ecbatana.\" (Haydock) --- From Ninive to Rages would be 10 or 12 days' journey. (Calmet)"

      v:008:
        - "TOB:6:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Its heart,</i> &c. <i>The liver,</i> (ver. 19.) God was pleased to give to these things a virtue against those proud spirits, to make them, who affected to be like the Most High, subject to such mean corporeal creatures, as instruments of his power. (Challoner) --- God sometimes makes use of things as remedies which have, naturally, a different effect; as when Christ put clay on the eyes of the blind man, John ix. The things which the angel ordered were salutary, by God's appointment. (Worthington) --- They could not act directly upon a spirit: but they might upon the person troubled by one, as Saul was relieved by music. (Calmet, Diss.) --- The <i>smoke</i> was a sign of the devil's expulsion, and of the efficacy of prayer; or rather, God subjected the proud spirits to such weak elements. (Serarius, q. 3.) (Menochius) --- Greek, \"and he said to him, <i>respecting</i> the heart and liver, if any demon or wicked spirit be troublesome, make these smoke before a man or a woman, and the person shall be troubled no longer."
      v:009:
        - 'TOB:6:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Gall.</i> This is generally allowed by physicians to be most excellent, particularly that of the callyonymus, and of the hyena, (Vales, Phil. 42.; Galen 10.; Menochius) and silurus, &c., so that one objection of the adversaries of this book falls to the ground. (Houbigant)'
      v:010:
        - 'TOB:6:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>And.</i> Greek, "But as they approached to Rages, the angel said to the young man: Brother, to-day we shall lodge with Raguel, and he is thy relation, and he has an only daughter, by name Sara: I will propose that she may be given to thee for a wife, because the inheritance belongs to thee, and thou art the only one of her kindred. The girl is beautiful and prudent. Now, therefore, give ear to me, and I will speak to her father, and when we return from Rages, we will celebrate the nuptials. For I know Raguel, that he will not give her to another man, comformably to the law of Moses, or he will incur death; because thou art entitled to the inheritance before any other. Then," &c., ver. 14. (Haydock) --- The law regulated the marriages of heiresses, (Numbers xxxvi. 6.) though not under pain of death. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'TOB:6:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Died.</i> Greek, "were destroyed in the nuptial chamber, ({GREEK:START numphe}νυμφη{GREEK:END}). And as I am my father’s only son, I fear lest, approaching to her, I should die like the former; because a demon is in love with her, which hurts no one but such as approach to her. Now, therefore, I fear lest I should die, and bring down the life of my father and mother upon me to their grave." (Haydock) --- If this text may be styled Scripture, it only records the opinion of Toby[Tobias]. (Calmet) or what he had "heard." (Haydock) --- Many grave authors have been of the same persuasion that devils could be enamoured with mortal beauties: (Calmet) <i>talesque asseverant ut hoc negare impudentiæ esse videatur.</i> (St. Augustine, de C.[City of God?] xv. 23; Delrio, Magic. 2.) --- But this opinion is now almost entirely abandoned. Many who have testified such things, may have experienced only some diabolical illusions. The devil could not love the beauty, nor the virtue of Sara. But he was permitted by God to exercise his malice against those who would have gratified their impure desires. (Calmet) --- We may perhaps decide too peremptorily on the nature of devils, with which we are little acquainted. As they are susceptible of pride, anger, &c., why may they not also give way to some subtle kind of mental impurity? (Houbigant)'
      v:015:
        - 'TOB:6:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>To hell.</i> That is, to the place where the souls were kept below, before the coming of Christ; (Challoner) as the just had not yet access to heaven. See Genesis xxxvii. (Worthington) Greek adds, "and they have no other son to bury them."'
      v:016:
        - 'TOB:6:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Raphael.</i> Greek, "said to him: Dost thou not remember that thy father ordered thee to take a wife of thy kindered? Now then hearken to me, brother; for she shall be thy wife. Mind not the devil. For this night she shall be given in marriage to thee; and if thou enter the nuptial chamber, thou shalt take the ashes of incense, and shalt place thereon some of the heart and liver," &c., ver. 19. (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - 'TOB:6:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Mule,</i> which are very libidinous, Psalm xiii. --- <i>Power.</i> Yet he is not always permitted to kill them, as God often allows them time for repentance, or suffers them to draw down heavier judgments. (Menochius) --- "The devils can do no more than God secretly permits;" (St. Augustine, de C.[City of God?] ii. 23.) and "God justly suffers the wicked to fall victims to their iniquitous appetites." (St. Gregory, mor. ii.)'
      v:018:
        - 'TOB:6:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Days.</i> No morality could be more pure. The Christian Church has given similar counsels, in the Capitulars of France, and of Erard, archbishop of Tours, and in many rituals published in the 16th century. The council of Trent only advises people to approach to the sacraments of penance and the Holy Eucharist, three days at least before marriage. The Greeks, in their third council of Carthage, (canon 13) order the first night to be spent in continence.'
      v:019:
        - 'TOB:6:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Lay.</i> Greek adds, "some of the heart....and make it smoke, and the devil shall smell, and flee away, and shall not return for ever." (Haydock) --- This is contrary to reason, say our adversaries. But though devils be incorporeal, may they not be affected by certain bodies, as our souls are when our limbs are hurt? The angel chose this sort of usual exorcism, that those who were present might be convinced of the devil’s departure. As the devils abuse the works of the creation, it was convenient that they should be punished by them; as they submit to magical operations, they must feel the power of such exorcisms (Houbigant) as are authorized by God and his Church. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'TOB:6:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Society</i> (<i>copulatione</i>.) He then obtained this blessing, though he knew not his wife till the fourth night. (Worthington) --- His marriage resembled that of the patriarchs. (Calmet) --- Greek, "But when thou shalt go to her, arise both, and cry to the merciful God, and he will save and have pity on you. Fear not, for she was prepared for thee from eternity; and thou shalt save her, and she shall go with thee; and I flatter myself that thou shalt have children of her. And as soon as Tobias heard this, he loved her, and his soul was much attached to her: and they arrived at Ecbatana." (Haydock) --- Some may wonder that Tobias did not ask for the consent of his parents. But the angel reminded him of his father’s injunctions, (Calmet) and spoke in such a manner, that he was convinced his counsel was from God. (Haydock)'

This mystically represented the Passion of Christ, by which the devil is expelled from men's hearts. (St. Augustine, ser. 28, de Sanct.; Prosper, promis. ii. c. 39.) (Worthington) --- Greek, \"and he took the ashes of incense, and placed thereon the heart of the fish and the liver, causing them to smoke. And when the devil perceived the odour, he fled to the highest parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him,\" (Haydock) confining his malice to those deserts. Jesus Christ insinuates that the devil walks through dry places, Matthew xii. 24. The angel was not seen to absent himself: (Calmet) --- This country was chosen as being very remote from Media. (Houbigant) --- It was afterwards sanctified by the presence of many Christian solitaries. (Haydock) --- Our adversaries laugh at this account. But surely Christ has used similar expressions of binding the devil, who cannot molest people, when he is not present; (Houbigant) or do any thing without the divine permission, chap. vi. 17. (Haydock)"

The ancient Vulgate seems rather more conformable to the present. \"Raguel ordered his wife to make several loaves, and going himself to the flock, he brought two cows and four rams, and ordered them to prepare a feast. He called Tobias, and swore to him, saying, Thou shalt not depart hence these 14 days, but remain here eating and drinking with me, and shalt fill with joy me and my daughter, who has been greatly afflicted. Receive half of my goods, and thou shalt return safe and sound to thy father; and after my death, and that of my wife, thou shalt have the other half.\" (Haydock) --- Greek and Hebrew mention nothing of the beasts slaughtered, or of Raguel's testament.

Without this interrogation, (Haydock) the Greek seems to be corrupt; (Calmet) and {GREEK:START os}οσ{GREEK:END}, "how," or {GREEK:START oi}οι{GREEK:END}, "woe," should be put instead of {GREEK:START ou}ου{GREEK:END}, "not."

(Calmet) ---If, therefore, the parents of Tobias expected that he would return in about 20 days, they might well wonder at the 14 days’ delay occasioned by the marriage. The distance might prevent him from giving notice of this event. Greek, "Dismiss me, because my, &c.,....no longer hope to see me again. But his father-in-law replied, Stop with me," &c., ver. 8.

Afterwards she departed, and Toby[Tobias] also blessing God, and he made his journey prosperous and blessed Raguel, and Edna, and his wife."

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'TOB:11:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Charan.</i> Not the residence of Abraham, Genesis xii. 4. Syriac reads, "Bazri," or "Carrac." Old Vulgate, <i>ibat Caracha, quæ est civitas in Ninive.</i> Arrian places Carcha in Assyria, and Ptolemy mentions a Characa in Susiana. --- <i>Midway.</i> At this rate, the distance from Ninive to Ecbatana would be 22 days’ journey. But it is not half so much for a man travelling expeditiously. (Calmet) --- Tobias had much luggage. Leaving it with his wife, (Haydock) he went from this city to Ninive in three or four days, ver. 18. (Calmet) --- Greek, "And he travelled on till he came near to Ninive. And Raphael said," &c.'
      v:003:
        - 'TOB:11:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>If.</i> Greek, "Let us go quickly before thy wife, and prepare the house." (Haydock) --- This would be necessary, for the reception of so many goods, as well as to relieve the anxiety (Calmet) of the aged parents, and prevent surprise.'
      v:004:
        - 'TOB:11:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>And.</i> Greek, "Take now in <i>thy</i> hand the gall of the fish. And they went on. And the dog followed close up to them; (Haydock; Syriac, "ran before them." Calmet) and Anna."'
      v:006:
        - 'TOB:11:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Cometh.</i> Greek adds, "and the man who went with him."'
      v:007:
        - 'TOB:11:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>To.</i> Greek, "I know, Tobias, that thy father will open his eyes. Anoint, therefore, the gall upon his eyes, and feeling the smart, he will rub and remove the white specks, and shall see thee." (Haydock) --- <i>God.</i> This laudable custom was observed by the ancient solitaries, and prescribed by the rule of St. Benedict, chap. 53.'
      v:009:
        - 'TOB:11:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>The dog,</i> &c. This may seem a very minute circumstance to be recorded in sacred history; but, as we learn from our Saviour, (St. Matthew v. 18) there are <i>iotas</i> and <i>tittles</i> in the word of God, that is to say, things that appear minute, but which have indeed a deep mysterious meaning in them. (Challoner) --- (Ven. Bede; St. Jerome in Isaias lvi. 8.; St. Augustine, contra Faust. xxii. 56.; Worthington) --- The other versions relate this event, ver. 4.'
      v:010:
        - 'TOB:11:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>And.</i> After ver. 7., Greek adds, "and Anna running before, fell upon the neck of her son, and said to him, I have beheld thee, son; henceforth I may die. And they both wept. And Tobit went out towards the door, and he stumbled. But his son ran up to him, and took hold of his father, and spread the gall upon his father’s eyes, saying, Have confidence, father. But as soon as they began to smart, he rubbed his eyes, and the white specks came off like skins from the corners: and beholding his son, he fell upon his neck, and wept. Then he said," ver. 17. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - 'TOB:11:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Hour.</i> This is not in the other versions. (Calmet) --- It would intimate that the operation was natural. (Menochius) --- Yet some think that the cure was too instantaneous; (Drusius) or that the miracle consisted in the revelation of a remedy, till then unknown. (Serarius) --- The effect seems to have been of the same nature as that produced by the heart, &c., chap. vi. 8. (Worthington; Calmet) --- Estius believes that the optic nerve was entirely burnt. If the external coat of the eyes was only covered with a sort of skin, it might be removed by the gall of several fishes. (Calmet) --- <i>Callionymi fel cicatrices sanat & carnes oculorum supervacuas consumit.</i> (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxii 4. (Menochius)'
      v:017:
        - 'TOB:11:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Lord.</i> Greek, "Blessed be God, and blessed be thy name for ever, and blessed be all thy holy angels; because thou hast scourged, and hast shewn mercy, and," &c.'
      v:018:
        - 'TOB:11:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Days.</i> Or perhaps hours; (Haydock) as the other versions intimate that Sara arrived the same day. (Calmet) --- Greek, "And his son entered, rejoicing, and related to his father the great things which had taken place in Media. And Tobit went out to meet his daughter-in-law, rejoicing, and blessing God, to the gate of Ninive. And those who saw him walking were astonished, because he saw. And Tobit confessed before them that God had taken pity on him. And as Tobit approached to Sarra, his daughter-in-law, he blessed her, saying, Mayst thou come with safety, daughter. Blessed be God, who has brought <i>thee</i> to us, and blessed be thy father and thy mother. And there was joy among all his brethren at Ninive. And," ver. 20. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - "TOB:11:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Achior.</i> Greek, \"Achiachar,\" mentioned [in] chap. i. 24. This text insinuates that he was also styled Anael (Haydock) and Nasbas, and was the nephew of Tobit. (Grotius) (Calmet) --- Greek, \"And there came Achiachar, and Nasbas, his brother's son, and the wedding of Tobias was kept in joy for seven days.\" (Haydock)"
      v:021:
        - 'TOB:11:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Joy.</i> Old Vulgate adds, "and many presents were made to him."'

      v:002:
        - 'TOB:12:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Said.</i> Greek, "Father, I shall not be hurt if I give him half of what I have brought, since he has conducted me safe back to thee, and has healed my wife, and brought my money, and likewise has cured thee. And the old man said, he justly deserves it. And he called the angel, and said to him, Take half of what you have brought, and depart in health. Then," ver. 6.'

(Haydock) --- The Old Vulgate greatly abridges the remainder of this book, having only, "Then Raphael having called the two Tobies, said to them, Since thou hast not delayed to arise, and to leave thy meals to bury the dead, I have been sent to try thee to heal thee, and to deliver thy daughter-in-law. I am Raphael, one of the angels who assist and appear before the brightness of God. Hereupon the two Tobies were startled, and fell prostrate on the ground, and were seized with fear. And Raphael said, Fear not, Peace be with you. Bless the Lord all the days of your life, and sing his praises. You thought that I eat when I was at table with you. But you saw with your eyes; (Haydock; only a vision, Calmet) wherefore bless the Lord upon the earth, and praise his goodness. As for me, I return to him who sent me. Write down all that has happened. The angel having spoken thus to Tobias, the latter wrote this prayer as a monument of his joy, and said, Blessed be the Lord, who is great in eternity, because his reign endures for ever. It is He who strikes, and who shews mercy, who conducts to the grave, and who, by his majesty, rescues from the greatest miseries; and no one can withdraw himself from his hands. <i>End of Tobias the just</i>." (Haydock) --- <i>King.</i> Secrecy is the soul of human councils, to prevent an enemy from thwarting our designs: but nothing can withstand the divine power. It is therefore proper to testify our gratitude for favours received, as the ancient saints have done by their canticles. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - 'TOB:12:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Alms.</i> Greek adds, "and justice. Better is a little with justice, than much with iniquity." (Haydock) --- Fasting and alms are like the wings of prayer. (Worthington) See chap. iv. 11.'
      v:009:
        - "TOB:12:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Everlasting.</i> This word is not found in Greek, though sufficiently implied; as liberality does not always secure a person's life, or temporal happiness.

      v:010:

I said then, It is good to conceal the mystery of the king, but glorious to manifest the works of God. And now, when thou and thy daughter-in-law, Sarra, did pray, I brought forward the memorial of your prayer before the holy one.\" (Haydock) --- The angels are represented as God's ministers, offering our prayers to him, Apocalypse viii. 3. (Calmet) (St. Augustine) (Worthington) --- Philo styles them ambassadors. Socrates says, \"every demon (or good spirit) is between God and mortals.\" (Plutarch) --- <i>Inter homines cælicolasque, vectores hinc precum, inde donorum.</i> (Apuleius de Deo Socrat.) (Calmet) --- Greek continues, \"and when thou didst bury the dead, in like manner, I was present with thee; when thou didst not delay to rise and leave thy dinner, that going thou mightest cover the dead; in thy good work, thou wast not hidden from me: but I was with thee. And,\" &c., ver. 14. (Haydock)"

        - 'TOB:12:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>From the devil,</i> is not in Greek.

See St. Luke xv., and xvi.; St. Chrysostom in col. hom. 3.; St. Augustine, City of God xi. 31., &c. (Worthington)'

All others are apocryphal; such as Uriel, Saltiel, Jeadriel Barachiel, &c. --- <i>Seven.</i> This number is clearly specified by St. John, Apocalypse i. 4. A mass in their honour was approved by Pius IV. It is supposed that the seven deacons in the Church of Rome, and of Jerusalem, were instituted in imitation of them. The kings, Assuerus, &c., had seven chief officers, Esther i. 10. (Calmet) --- <i>Lord,</i> ready to fulfil his orders, as innumerable other angels, of inferior degree, are likewise. (Menochius) (Daniel vii. 10.) --- These were the princes of the heavenly court. St. Jerome (contra Jovin.) admits only seven orders of angels. (Calmet) --- Greek, "I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels who offer up the prayers of the saints, and go out before the glory of the Holy One. And they were both troubled," &c., (Haydock) at so unusual a thing, (Menochius) and filled with reverential awe. (Haydock) --- They might also suspect that death would shortly follow. (Calmet) (Genesis xvi. 13.)'

        - 'TOB:12:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>I.</i> Greek, "I appeared to you all the days; yet I did not eat nor drink. But you beheld a vision." (Haydock) --- Having an aerial body, he made the provisions disappear, as the sun melts snow, Genesis xviii. 9. (Calmet) --- He might swallow, though he had no need of meat, (St. Augustine, City of God xiii. 22.) or digestion, (Grotius) so as to convert it into his substance. (Menochius) --- <i>Men.</i> I constantly enjoy the beatific vision, Matthew xviii. 10. (Calmet)'

And they arose, and beheld him no longer; and they proclaimed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared to them." (Haydock) --- Almost all interpreters infer from this injunction, (Calmet) that the work before us was originally composed by these holy men. (Haydock)'

(Haydock) --- But God had the good of the Gentiles in view, that they might become acquainted with his law, and behold the conduct of his saints, Tobias, Esther, Daniel, &c., (Calmet) as well as to punish his people. (Haydock) --- Temporal afflictions are sometimes for the spiritual good of others. (Worthington) --- Greek, "because he has scattered you among them. There shew forth his grandeur, and extol him before every one living: for he is our Lord and God, our Father for ever. Yea, he hath chastised us in our iniquities, again he will have mercy, and will gather us from all nations where he has scattered us, if ye be converted to him with all your heart, and with all your soul, to act sincerely. Then he will turn towards you, and will not hide his face from you; and ye shall behold what he will do with you, and ye shall confess to him with all your mouth, and bless the Lord of power, and extol the king of ages. I," &c., ver. 7. (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - TOB:13:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Mercy.</i> He can discover nothing in the sinner. (Calmet)
      v:007:
        - 'TOB:13:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Nation;</i> the Israelites, (Menochius) whom he has chastised. (Haydock) --- Ninive was still flourishing. Yet the Greek seems to refer to the Assyrian idolaters, (Calmet) or to both. Greek, "and I shew his power and magnificence to a sinful nation. Who knows if he will love and shew his mercy to you? I exalt my God, and my soul <i>magnifies</i> the King of heaven, and shall gladly proclaim his greatness: let all speak and confess to him in justice."'
      v:011:
        - 'TOB:13:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Jerusalem.</i> What is prophetically delivered here, and in the following chapter, with relation to Jerusalem, is partly to be understood of the rebuilding the city after the captivity, and partly of the spiritual Jerusalem, which is the Church of Christ, and the eternal Jerusalem in heaven. (Challoner) --- It would seem that Jerusalem and the temple were now destroyed, which is contrary to chronology, as Manasses had not yet began to reign, (Calmet) and Tobias died when he had been on the throne fifty-two years. (Houbigant) --- But the Greek shews that (Calmet) he speaks prophetically: (Worthington) "Jerusalem, holy city, He will chastise thee for the works of thy children, and again he will shew mercy on the children of the just. Confess to the Lord, for he is good; and bless the king of ages, that his tabernacle may be again rebuilt in thee, with joy." (Haydock) --- The Hebrew of Munster had only a few verses of this and the following chapter. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'TOB:13:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Call.</i> Greek, "cause thy captives to rejoice in thee, and love in thee all the distressed unto eternity."'
      v:013:
        - 'TOB:13:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Thou.</i> Greek, "Many nations from afar shall come to the name of the Lord God, with presents in their hands, presents for the king of heaven; race after race shall praise thee, and give exultation. They," &c., ver. 16. (Haydock) --- How many potent monarchs of Persia, Egypt, Rome, &c., honoured the temple of Jerusalem! How many wars have been carried on by Christian potentates, to rescue that favourite spot out of the hands of infidels! all out of respect for Christ. These priests are still better verified in his Church, to which the powers of the earth have submitted, (Calmet) esteeming it an honour and happiness to be members of this holy society. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - 'TOB:13:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Holy.</i> This soil has been carried into distant countries, out of reverence, (4 Kings v. 17.; St. Augustine, City of God xxii.8.) and has been honoured with miracles. (St. Gregory Turon. i. 7.)'
      v:016:
        - 'TOB:13:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Despise.</i> Greek, "hate thee, and blessed shall be those who love thee for ever." (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - 'TOB:13:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>But.</i> Greek, "rejoice, and exult for the children of the just, because they shall be gathered together, and shall bless the Lord of the just." (Haydock) --- The people of God, in the old law, have often this title, as those of the new are styled <i>saints.</i> Both have a claim to this prediction. The Jews became more faithful after the captivity, so that the most cruel persecution of Epiphanes could not overcome their resolution; and the world was astonished at the courage of the martyrs, and the exemplary conduct of the primitive Christians. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - 'TOB:13:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Peace.</i> Greek adds, "blessed are those who have mourned on account of thy chastisements, because they shall rejoice, beholding all thy glory, and their joy shall endure for ever." (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - 'TOB:13:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Thou.</i> Greek, "God, the great king: For Jerusalem," &c., ver. 21. (Haydock) --- <i>Troubles.</i> This regards only the heavenly Jerusalem. (Worthington)'
      v:020:
        - 'TOB:13:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Seed.</i> Hence it appears that Tobias did not speak of an approaching event, (Calmet) or at least he wished that his posterity might be set free.'
      v:021:
        - 'TOB:13:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Emerald.</i> Greek adds, "and precious stone: thy walls, and towers, and battlements, of pure gold. And the streets of Jerusalem shall be strewed with beryl and carbuncle, and stone from Soupheir." (Haydock) --- This description resembles that of Isaias, (liv. 11.) who lived a little before. St. John (Apocalypse xxi.10.) represents the church in the same ornaments, denoting the merits of Christ and the virtues of his saints. All are convinced that such expressions are not to be taken in the literal sense. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - 'TOB:13:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Alleluia.</i> A sound of praise. St. Augustine (ep. 86.) means, "Praise ye the Lord (Haydock) with joy." (Worthington) --- It is disused in times of penance. (Calmet) --- Greek adds, " and they shall praise, saying, Blessed be God, who has exalted <i>it</i> for ever."'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'TOB:14:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Words.</i> Greek, "confession; (or hymn of praise) and he was 58 years old when he lost his sight, which he recovered eight years after, and gave alms, and continued to fear the Lord God, and to confess unto him. Now he arrived at a very advanced age," 158, ver. 10. (Haydock) --- But this chronology must be abandoned. All the versions disagree; and perhaps there may be none perfectly accurate. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'TOB:14:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Two.</i> Arabic and Schol. History, read "twelve."'
      v:005:
        - 'TOB:14:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Seven.</i> Greek Compl. and Alexandrian, as well as Fagius, have only "six."'
      v:006:
        - 'TOB:14:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>The.</i> Greek, "Son, take thy children. Behold, I am grown old, and my life is hastening to an end. Depart into Media, <i>my</i> son, for I believe all that the prophet, Jonas, spoke concerning Ninive, that it will be overturned. But in Media there will be more peace for a time, and that our brethren in the land will be scattered from the good land; and Jerusalem shall be deserted, and the house of God in it will be burnt, and shall be abandoned for a time; and they shall build the house, not like the former, till the times of the world <i>or</i> age be accomplished; and afterwards they shall return from the captives, and shall build Jerusalem gloriously; and the house of God shall be built in it, and the edifice shall be glorious for ever, as the prophets have spoken concerning it; and all the Gentiles shall turn truly to fear the Lord God, and shall undermine (and destroy) their idols; and all the Gentiles shall bless the Lord," &c., ver. 9. (Haydock) --- This text is of importance, as it specifies the name of Jonas, and is quoted by St. Jerome; (ibid.) though Nahum (iii. 8.) and Sophonias (ii. 13.) also foretold the destruction of Ninive. It speaks of the future, and not of the past ruin, of the temple, which certainly took place after the death of Tobias. (Calmet) --- The prophets, however, frequently speak of future events, as if they were past, to shew the certainty of their predictions. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'TOB:14:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>In it.</i> Let the Jews shew when this was accomplished. We can easily point out the nations converted from idolatry to the Church of Christ, as the prophets foretold, Jeremias iii. 17., and xvi. 19. (Calmet) --- It cannot, therefore, be understood of the temporal Jerusalem. (Worthington)'
      v:009:
        - 'TOB:14:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>And.</i> Greek, "And his people shall confess to God, and the Lord shall exalt his people, and all shall rejoice who love the Lord God in truth and justice, shewing mercy to our brethren. And now, son, depart from Ninive; for what the prophet, Jonas, spoke, shall surely be accomplished." (Haydock) --- This prediction was conditional, as was also the pardon of the people, who were justly punished for their relapse. (Menochius)'
      v:010:
        - 'TOB:14:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Seek</i> with diligence, not barely doing what you are commanded. (Haydock) --- Greek is much more diffuse. (Calmet) --- "But do thou keep the law and the ordinances, be a lover of alms-deeds, and just, that it may be well with thee. Bury me with decency, and thy mother with me, and tarry <i>then</i> no longer at Ninive. Son, behold what Aman (Syriac, Acab.) did to Achiachar, who fed him, how he conducted him from light into darkness, and what return he made him. Now, Achiachar met with safety: but he received his due, and he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and was rescued from the snare of death, which was laid for him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished. And now, son, behold the effects of alms-deeds, and how justice brings deliverance. While he was speaking these things, his soul failed upon the bed: but he was 150 years old, and he buried him honourably." (Haydock) --- The allusion to Aman seems improper, he lived many years after the captivity; (Calmet) or rather it may refer to some other history (Houbigant) with which we are not acquainted. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - 'TOB:14:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>And.</i> Greek, "And when Anna, his mother, was dead; he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and sons to Ecbatana, to Raguel, his father-in-law, and lived to an honourable old age; and he buried honourably his father and mother-in-law, and he inherited their substance, as well as that of his father, Tobit." (Haydock)'
      v:015:
        - 'TOB:14:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Fifth.</i> Including himself. He might see the offspring of his great grandson, if he lived only 70 years after his marriage. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'TOB:14:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Nine.</i> Syriac, 107. (Calmet) --- Greek, "But he also died at the age of 127, at Ecbatana, of Media; and he heard, before his death, of the destruction of Ninive, <i>the citizens of</i> which Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus led captives; and he rejoiced over Ninive before he died." We have been more particular in giving the Greek text of this book, because some look upon it as an original; and we should wish to lose no particle of the word of God, which is more precious than gold. Tobias might applaud the execution of divine justice without any private resentment. (Haydock) --- Ninive was taken by Nabuchodonosor, who acted for his father, Nabopolassar, with whom Astyages, king of the Medes, was leagued. They took the city in the reign of Chinaladan, or Sarac, in the year of the world 3378. It also fell a prey to its enemies, under Sardanapalus, in the year 3257; as the inhabitants did not persevere in sentiments of repentance, which they had entertained at the preaching of Jonas, in the reign of Phul. Hence God revealed its destruction to Tobias. (Calmet) --- <i>With joy,</i> may refer to the surviving friends, who rejoiced interiorly at his felicity, while they wept for their own loss; or it may he understood of the deceased; who, like his father, (ver. 4.; Calmet) rejoiced in the Lord, and in performance of good works.'
      v:017:
        - 'TOB:14:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Kindred.</i> Behold the influence of good example; (Haydock) and a proof that the true religion failed not in Israel, much less in Juda, or the Church of Christ. (Worthington) --- The virtues of these two holy men are truly deserving of applause and imitation. They thought and acted in perfect conformity with the gospel. The father might represent the old law, under all its inconveniences, while the son holds forth the light of Christ, and banishes the devil. (Calmet)'
