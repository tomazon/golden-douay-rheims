    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JER:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Helcias,</i> the high priest who discovered the book of the law, (Clement of Alexandria, Strom. i., &c.) though this be uncertain. --- <i>Anathoth,</i> a village to the north of Jerusalem, to which many priests had retired, though it did not belong to them. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'JER:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Joakim.</i> His immediate predecessor and successor, both called Jechonias, (Haydock) are passed over, as their reign was short, (Calmet) only lasting three months each. (Haydock) --- <i>Fifth.</i> Jerusalem was taken on the 9th of the preceding month. But the temple was not burnt, nor the captives sent off till the fifth month, or the 10th of the civil year, chap. xxxix. 8., and lii. 13., and 4 Kings xxv. 2. (Calmet) --- Jeremias also prophesied in Egypt, chap. xliv. (Worthington) --- But this title alludes to his principal predictions. (Menochius)'
      v:005:
        - 'JER:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Knew,</i> with affection, and designed thee for this office from eternity. Many think (Calmet) that Jeremias was purified from original sin before his birth. (St. Augustine) --- He had this privilege, and was also a priest, prophet, virgin, and martyr. (Worthington) --- Yet to <i>sanctify,</i> often means only to set aside, Exodus xiii. 2., and Ecclesiasticus xlix. 9. --- <i>Nations,</i> whose overthrow he points out, chap. xxv. 27, 44, &c. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'JER:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Ah.</i> Hebrew <i>ahah.</i> Septuagint, "thou Being." Protestants, "Then said I: Ah, Lord God." (Haydock) --- He does not imitate a child. He might be above 30 years old, though some say (Calmet) only 14, (Tirinus) or less; yet he finds himself devoid of eloquence, like Moses, Exodus xiv. 10. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - 'JER:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Mouth;</i> perhaps (Haydock) with a coal, by means of an angel, (Isaias vi. 5.) in a sort of dream. He found himself changed into a new man.'
      v:010:
        - 'JER:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Root up,</i> to announce the fall and restoration of many nations, Ezechiel iv. 2. (Calmet) --- Jeremias spoke of the Gentiles, as well as of the Jews. (Worthington)'
      v:011:
        - "JER:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Watching.</i> Hebrew, \"of an almond.\" Septuagint, \"nut-tree.\" (Haydock) --- The almond-tree flourishes in January, and bears fruit in March. (Theodoret) (Pliny, [Natural History?] xvi. 25.) --- Thus God will speedily send his scourge from Babylon, to punish his people. (Calmet) ---The sense is the same. (Menochius) --- God's law is outwardly bitter, but the kernel is sweet. (Theodoret) (Worthington)"
      v:013:
        - 'JER:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>North,</i> whence the wind blows, to make the fire burn more intensely. Assyria lay to the north, and Babylon to the east of Judea; but the troops always penetrated the northern frontier, as they could not pass through the Desert Arabia. The <i>caldron</i> represented Jerusalem, Ezechiel xi. 3., and xxiv. 3.'
      v:014:
        - 'JER:1:14 | 14 | 14-15 | <i>North.</i> The tributary kings were forced to attend, Judith ii. 7., and 3 Kings xx. 1. --- <i>About.</i> The princes thus took Sedecias, and sent him to Reblatha, chap. xxxix. 3. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'JER:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Loins.</i> Make haste, and take courage, Job xxxviii. 3. (Menochius)'
      v:019:
        - 'JER:1:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Prevail.</i> God does not promise peace, but victory. (Worthington)'

(St. Thomas Aquinas, [Summa Theologica] i. 2. q. 102. a. 3.) --- Yet the paschal lamb, &c., had been already commanded. (Calmet) --- Many such absolute expressions imply a condition or comparison. (Gloss.) (Proverbs viii. 10.) --- <i>I brought.</i> Several manuscripts read thus more accurately than the Hebrew, "He brought," (Kennicott) which Protestants abandon, (Haydock) though the present reading may stand. (Chappel.) (Crat.) --- Every variation should be noticed, as this and the former verse "seem greatly corrupted; perhaps the Syriac version will be the best guide to their true meaning."

(Haydock) --- They have read <i>áuss,</i> "a den," instead of <i>hait,</i> "a bird." Bochart, (iii. 11.) however, shews that the latter word denotes various wild beasts, and nearly follows the Septuagint. Though the inheritance be most charming, it shall not pass unpunished.

(Calmet) --- Yet a journey to the Euphrates would represent more strikingly the destination of the people; and it would not be difficult for God to convey Jeremias thither in a short time, if requisite, as he sent Habacuc through the air to carry a dinner to Daniel; (xiv. 32.) though this supposition is not here necessary, as the labour to which Jeremias was repeatedly exposed, might shew the people their manifold transgressions and captivities.

        - "JER:15:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>If.</i> The Geneva Bible reads corruptly, \"Though Moses...stood,\" contrary to Hebrew and Greek. (Worthington) --- <i>And Samuel.</i> These two had shewn a particular love for the people, Exodus xxxii., and 2 Kings xii. (Calmet) --- Ezechiel (xiv. 4.) specifies Noe[Noah], Daniel, and Job, who were eminent for sanctity. Daniel was still alive. Yet God will not grant their request; and he forbids his prophet to pray for those who were resolved not to repent, chap. xiv. 11. (Haydock) --- Their punishment was fixed, and God will not remit it at the request either of the living or of the dead. Hence it is evident, that the dead could and did sometimes make intercession, otherwise they would not here be mentioned. To evade this argument, Protestants in the Geneva Bible, suppose God's \"meaning <i>to be,</i> that if there were any man living, moved with so great zeal towards the people as were these two, yet he would not grant their request, for so much as he had determined the contrary.\" Yet surely Jeremias, Daniel, &c., had a similar zeal; and therefore the text speaks of Moses and Samuel in a state of happiness, where their charity is greater than in this life, as St. Jerome, St. Chrysostom (hom. 1. in 1 Thessalonians) and St. Gregory (Mor. ix. 12.) explain it. (Worthington) --- Jeremias had been praying earnestly for the people in the temple.

On such occasions his work was very useful; but the marks being soon neglected, great confusion ensued. (St. Jerome) (Kennicott, Dis. ii.) --- Grabe has restored these verses in his edition. (Haydock) --- Eusebius (Dem. x.) and Theodoret acknowledged them; and Nobilius found the first verse thus expressed in many copies, (Calmet) as it is in Grabe: \"The sin of Juda is expressed in writing with a <i>finger</i> nail of adamant, cleaving to the breast of,\" &c.

Such expressions as these in the writings of the prophets, are not to be understood as imprecations proceeding from malice or desire of revenge, but as prophetic predictions of evils that were about to fall upon impenitent sinners, and approbations of the ways of the divine justice.

He treated Jeremias in this light. (Calmet) --- See Luke xxii. 52. (Haydock)'

      v:003:
        - 'JER:20:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Phassur.</i> This name signifies, <i>increase</i> and <i>principality;</i> and therefore is here changed to <i>Magor-Missabib,</i> or "fear on every side," to denote the evils that should come upon him in punishment of his opposing the word of God. (Challoner) --- Aquila renders <i>Posseur,</i> "a stranger," and St. Jerome, "blackness of visage." (Haydock) --- It may also mean, "one who causes paleness." (Calmet) --- <i>Mogur</i> may signify "fear <i>or</i> distress." Septuagint and Syriac, "an exile." (Haydock) --- He deserved to be thus treated, ver. 6. (Calmet) --- He would be terrified by many enemies. (Worthington)'
      v:006:
        - 'JER:20:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Lie.</i> He was therefore a false prophet, and vexed that Jeremias should contradict him. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'JER:20:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Thou hast deceived,</i> &c. The meaning of the prophet is not to charge God with any untruth; but what he calls <i>deceiving,</i> was only the concealing from him, when he accepted of the prophetical commission, the greatness of the evils which the execution of that commission was to bring upon him. (Challoner) --- Hebrew, "thou hast enticed me," when I declined the office. (Tirinus) --- God never promised that he should suffer no persecution. (Haydock) --- Jeremias might also have supposed that he was to be sent to the Gentiles, chap. i. 5. (St. Jerome in chap xxv. 18.) --- The oriental languages are much more lofty than ours, and express common things in the strongest manner. (Calmet) --- We may perceive the different emotions of fear and joy (Du Hamel) with which the prophet was actuated, like St. Paul, and our Saviour himself. The saints evince the weakness of man and the power of divine grace. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "If thou, Lord, hast deceived me, I am," &c. (Tournemine)'
      v:008:
        - 'JER:20:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Day.</i> They keep asking where are these enemies from the north, the plagues? &c. (Calmet) --- He is sorry to see the word of God despised, (Theodoret) and is guilty of a venial pusillanimity, concluding that his words had no good effect. (Menochius)'
      v:009:

      v:012:
        - 'JER:20:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Let me see,</i> &c. This prayer proceeded not from hatred or ill-will, but zeal of justice. (Challoner) --- He expresses in a human manner a future punishment.'
      v:013:
        - 'JER:20:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Sing.</i> God having shewn that his prayer should be heard, he gives thanks, (Calmet) and thus shews that what he is going to say proceeds not from impatience. (Theodoret)'
      v:014:
        - 'JER:20:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Cursed,</i> &c. In these and the following words of the prophet, there is a certain figure of speech to express with more energy the greatness of the evils to which his birth had exposed him. (Challoner) --- The wicked would deem the day of his birth <i>cursed,</i> or unlucky. (Menochius) --- Jeremias was now in prison, (Grotius) and people in pain express themselves forcibly, particularly in the East, ver. 7., and Job iii. 2. (Calmet) --- Perhaps no <i>man</i> had announced the tidings of his birth, or he might be no longer living to feel the effects of a curse: as the <i>day</i> was certainly irrevocably past. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - 'JER:20:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Repented,</i> his decree for the ruin of Sodom being fixed. --- <i>Noon.</i> This is more extraordinary than at midnight. Let him always be terrified with dismal sounds. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - "JER:20:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Who.</i> Septuagint, \"because he (the Lord.; Du Hamel; Tirinus) slew me not in my mother's womb.\" (Haydock) --- Syriac, Grotius, &c., explain the Hebrew in the same sense, though it may also agree with the Vulgate, <i>from the womb,</i> or as soon as I was born. O that I had never seen the light! (Calmet) --- He abstracts from the effects of original sin. (Tirinus) --- It is better not to exist than to be in constant misery, Matthew xxvi. (St. Jerome) (Worthington) --- The prophet bewailed the abuse which was made of God's word, by unbelievers, ver. 8. (Haydock)"

        - 'JER:28:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Juda.</i> So far Sanctius joins with the former chapter, improperly. <i>In the 4th year,</i> seems rather an interpolation; though the Septuagint omit <i>in the beginning,</i> &c., to reconcile the passage; and others date the 4th year from the last sabbatical one, which is quite unusual. See chap. xxvii. 1. (Calmet) --- Sedecias reigned 11 years, so that the 4th might be said to be the beginning.

Men shall go about in <i>thy</i> salvation.\" This \"might be explained, if it were not sacrilegious to argue respecting God's word by human sense,\" says St. Jerome; though this censure of \"the Vulgate\" (Septuagint) seems rather harsh. He complains here of his copy. Theodoret explains it of the apostles going through the world to spread the gospel. (Haydock) --- Behold whence thy happiness must come, (Menochius) O thou who hast so long proved faithless, going <i>astray after many lovers.</i> (Haydock) --- Christ, in his mother's womb, was in stature small, but a perfect man (Worthington) in the use of reason, &c.

Yet God requires us to have recourse to men, in order to know his truths, as St. Paul was sent to Hananias, and the eunuch to Philip. [Acts viii., and ix.] (Haydock) --- The apostles were enlightened by the Holy Ghost, (John vi. 45.; St. Augustine, de Spir.; Calmet) who still guides the flock by his pastors. The private spirit is too fanatical and delusive. (Haydock) --- The most ignorant shall easily become acquainted with the truths of salvation. External preaching is requisite, though of little use unless grace touch the mind and the heart. (Tirinus) --- All will hear successively, (Haydock) or embrace the gospel at the same time, for several years before the last day.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JER:32:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Tenth.</i> The city had been besieged about a year, (chap. xxxix. 1.) and the prophet continued to admonish the king and people of their fate, chap. xxxiv. (Calmet) --- He bought land, to shew that they should one day return. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - 'JER:32:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Court,</i> at large, so that people might come to him freely. He was not chained or in prison, as [in] chap. xxxvii. 15., and xxxviii. 6, 13. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - 'JER:32:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Eyes.</i> They were afterwards put out at Reblatha, (Haydock) so that he could not see Babylon, Ezechiel xii. 13. (Worthington) --- Sedecias was imprisoned, and buried there by the Jews, chap. xxxiv. 5, 12.'
      v:007:
        - "JER:32:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Next.</i> Priests could sell only to their fellow priests, Leviticus xxv. 34. (St. Jerome) --- Others might dispose of their landed property to any, until the year of jubilee. The nearest relation had the first offer, but he was not obliged to purchase. Jeremias now consented, to shew that the people should return to possess the land, though it was now in the enemy's hands. (Calmet) --- Thus a Roman purchased the land on which Hannibal was encamped, despising his power and threats. (V. Max. iii. 8.; Livy xxvi.) (Haydock)"
      v:008:
        - JER:32:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Came</i> into the city clandestinely; or rather he entered before the siege. (Calmet)
      v:009:
        - 'JER:32:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Silver.</i> Hebrew, "seventeen sicles of silver." (Haydock) --- Coin was not yet used. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'JER:32:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Outside.</i> "There was another copy left open for inspection, (ver. 14.) which custom still prevails," says St. Jerome. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - 'JER:32:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Days,</i> safe from dampness, &c. Thus Origen found a version of the Bible preserved at Jericho. (Calmet) --- After the captivity, the owners shall claim their land.'
      v:017:
        - 'JER:32:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Alas.</i> Hebrew <i>ahah, ah!</i> only once. Septuagint, "O, <i>thou</i> Being, Lord God." (Haydock) --- <i>Hard.</i> Hebrew also, "hidden, wonderful," &c. (Calmet) --- "When the gods perform, nothing appears incredible." (Pindar, Pyt. x.) See ver. 27., and Luke i. 37. (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - 'JER:32:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>After them,</i> to the third and fourth generation, Exodus xxxiv. 7. His mercy is more exalted. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - 'JER:32:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Day.</i> We remember thy ancient miracles, and witness others.'
      v:023:
        - 'JER:32:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Any of.</i> Literally, "all those," which seems better, as he who offends <i>in one,</i> becomes guilty <i>of all;</i> and the Jews certainly had observed some precepts, though they did not persevere unto the end. (Haydock)'
      v:024:
        - 'JER:32:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>By.</i> Literally, "at the presence of the sword," or by its force, Psalm lix. 6. (Worthington)'

      v:029:
        - 'JER:32:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Baal,</i> the sun, &c., chap. xix. 13., Sophonias i. 5., and 4 Kings xxiii. 12. (Calmet)'
      v:030:
        - 'JER:32:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Continually,</i> (Symmachus) "moreover," (Aquila) or "alone," (Septuagint and Theodoret) ver. 23. (Haydock) --- The Jews had rebelled in the desert. (Worthington)'
      v:031:
        - 'JER:32:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Built it.</i> The Jebusites polluted it. David himself offended, as well as Solomon, and under all the kings many crimes were committed, (Calmet) which is always the case in large cities. These general terms only denote a great corruption, tough some would be virtuous. (Haydock)'
      v:034:
        - 'JER:32:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>It,</i> under Achaz, Manasses, and perhaps the last kings of Juda, Ezechiel viii. 9.'
      v:035:
        - 'JER:32:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Consecrate.</i> Hebrew, "make <i>them</i> pass" through or into the fire, to be consumed in honour of Moloc, 4 Kings xxi. 6. --- <i>Heart.</i> They perhaps meant to imitate Abraham, chap. vii. 31.'
      v:037:
        - "JER:32:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Lands.</i> What is here said must be understood of the captives, yet in such a manner that Christians are more particularly designated, for the Jews never enjoyed such perfect security, nor followed <i>one way,</i> nor enjoyed the eternal covenant, (ver. 39, 40., and chap. xxxi. 31.; Calmet) except those who embraced the true faith of Christ. At all times <i>one</i> religion alone can be pleasing to God, (ver. 39.) and those who were saved under the old law, must have believed in a Redeemer to come, as we must do in one already past. (Haydock) --- God would not suffer true believers to become extinct under the old law; much less will he since Christ's coming. (Worthington)"
      v:041:
        - 'JER:32:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Truth,</i> like a tree which shall not be eradicated.'
      v:044:
        - 'JER:32:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>Juda, and in.</i> A farther description of these cities is given, situated about the capital, Hebron, Sephala, (<i>the plain</i>) near Gaza, (Calmet) and the <i>Negeb</i> or <i>south</i> country, (Haydock) towards Arabia. Here the excellent commentary of St. Jerome ends, to our great loss. (Calmet) --- It was perhaps his last work, undertaken after the twelve minor and the other three great prophets. He never wrote on Baruch, on the epistle of Jeremias, the Greek parts of Daniel, &c., as the Jews did not allow them to be canonical, and the point was not then decided. The Church styles St. Jerome "the greatest doctor in expounding the sacred Scriptures," as he translated and illustrated the greatest part of them; (Haydock) and indeed he seems to have been the best qualified for the undertaking, of all the fathers. (Du Pin) --- Hence we may lament the more that we have not all his works in their genuine purity and perfection, as even the latest editions are very faulty, and proceed upon a plan which the learned do not approve. See A. Butler, Kennicott, &c. (Haydock)'

      v:004: 'JER:32:4 | 4 | 4 | And Sedecias, king of Juda, shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans; but he shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon; and he shall speak to him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes.'
      v:005: 'JER:32:5 | 5 | 5 | And he shall lead Sedecias to Babylon; and he shall be there till I visit him, saith the Lord. But if you will fight against the Chaldeans, you shall have no success.'

      v:007: 'JER:32:7 | 7 | 7 | Behold, Hanameel, the son of Sellem, thy cousin, shall come to thee, saying: Buy thee my field, which is in Anathoth, for it is thy right to buy it, being next akin.'
      v:008: "JER:32:8 | 8 | 8 | And Hanameel, my uncle's son, came to me, according to the word of the Lord, to the entry of the prison, and said me: Buy my field, which is in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and thou art next of kin to possess it. And I understood that this was the word of the Lord."
      v:009: "JER:32:9 | 9 | 9 | And I bought the field of Hanameel, my uncle's son, that is in Anathoth: and I weighed him the money, seven staters, and ten pieces of silver."

      v:011: 'JER:32:11 | 11 | 11 | And I took the deed of the purchase, that was sealed, and the stipulations, and the ratifications, with the seals, that were on the outside.'

      v:013: 'JER:32:13 | 13 | 13 | And I charged Baruch before them, saying:'
      v:014: 'JER:32:14 | 14 | 14 | Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these writings, this deed of the purchase that is sealed up, and this deed that is open, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.'
      v:015: 'JER:32:15 | 15 | 15 | For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses, and fields, and vineyards, shall be possessed again in this land.'
      v:016: 'JER:32:16 | 16 | 16 | And, after I had delivered the deed of purchase to Baruch, the son of Neri, I prayed to the Lord, saying:'
      v:017: 'JER:32:17 | 17 | 17 | Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, behold thou hast made heaven and earth by thy great power, and thy stretched out arm; no word shall be hard to thee.'

      v:023: 'JER:32:23 | 23 | 23 | And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, and they walked not in thy law: and they did not any of those things that thou didst command them to do, and all these evils are come upon them.'
      v:024: 'JER:32:24 | 24 | 24 | Behold works are built up against the city to take it: and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans, who fight against it, by the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken, is all come to pass, as thou thyself seest.'

      v:030: 'JER:32:30 | 30 | 30 | For the children of Israel, and the children of Juda, have continually done evil in my eyes from their youth: the children of Israel, who even till now provoke me with the work of their hands, saith the Lord.'

      v:033: 'JER:32:33 | 33 | 33 | And they have turned their backs to me, and not their faces: when I taught them early in the morning, and instructed them, and they would not hearken to receive instruction.'

      v:005:
        - 'JER:36:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Shut up.</i> Not that the prophet was now in prison; for the contrary appears from ver. 19., but that he kept himself shut up, by reason of the persecutions he had lately met with. See chap. xxvi. (Challoner) --- If he had been confined, as Grotius asserts, the king would easily have found him. (Calmet) --- He and Baruch retired to some secret place, as most priests (Worthington) did formerly in England, (Haydock) that they might better exercise their functions than they could do in the hands of the persecutors.

        - 'JER:36:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>They.</i> Literally, "their supplication may fall prostrate before," &c. (Haydock) --- It is personified. So Homer represents (Calmet) "supplications," as daughters of Jupiter, lame, and with eyes averted, (Iliad ix.) to shew how we ought to pray. Jeremias finds means to instruct the people: the <i>word of God is not bound,</i> 2 Timothy ii. 9. (Calmet) --- As many refused to hear his discourses, God ordered him to write what might be a perpetual warning and reproach, or testimony against them. (Worthington)'

Though the climate was warm, fires would be useful in November. --- <i>Hearth.</i> There was no chimney used, and the smoke went out by the door, or by holes at the top of the room, as we see in some old monasteries. (Calmet) --- Charcoal was probably used, Baruch vi. 42.'
      v:023:
        - "JER:36:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Pages.</i> Perhaps what was written on so many skins, (Haydock) or sheets of paper, pasted together, and rolled up; or there might be some marks to shew the different subjects, like the sections used in the synagogue, (Calmet) or our chapters; though we are assured that all was formerly written without any separation even of letters. Protestants have \"leaves.\" (Haydock) --- Hebrew, \"doors.\" (Calmet) The secretary cut and burnt the leaves by the king's order, ver. 25. (Worthington)"

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JER:50:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Prophet.</i> He had spoken against them in the fourth year of Joachim, and now is more explicit in the fourth of Sedecias, (chap. li. 60.) sending his predictions to be read, and then thrown into the Euphrates. The fall of Babylon was gradual. It was in consequence of her pride and cruelty, ver. 11, 17, 23, 29., and Isaias xlvii. 6. (Calmet) --- It had shewn the greatest enmity to the Jews, and was at last overthrown by the Medes and Persians. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - 'JER:50:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Declare.</i> This is grand. Let all the captives publish these tidings. (Calmet) --- <i>Bel,</i> &c. Bel and Merodach were worshipped for gods by the men of Babylon. (Challoner) --- Merodach might be an ancient king deified. (Calmet) --- These greatest of their idols could neither save the people nor themselves. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - 'JER:50:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>A nation,</i> &c., viz., the Medes, (Challoner) under Darius, (Daniel v. 31.; Theodoret; Grotius) or rather under Cyrus, who came upon Babylon from the north, after conquering Asia; though he was born to the east of that city, Isaias lxi. 2, 25. He was a Mede by his mother, and ruler of that nation. He gave liberty to the Jews, as the prophet inculcates ten times. --- <i>Desolate.</i> Herodotus, Xenophon, &c., say not that Cyrus demolished any part of the city; but Berosus informs us that he took it without opposition, and levelled the outer walls. Hystaspes did more damage. (Herodotus iii. 150.)'
      v:004:
        - 'JER:50:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Weeping</i> for joy and compunction. Israel returns, as well as Juda. (Calmet) --- Thus Joseph wept when he beheld his brethren, Genesis xlii. 24. (Worthington)'
      v:005:
        - 'JER:50:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Covenant.</i> They renewed the old one under Nehemias, and never publicly broke it, as they had done. Yet the covenant of Christ is more properly meant.'
      v:006:
        - 'JER:50:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Shepherds;</i> kings, (Calmet) and false prophets. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - 'JER:50:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Not sinned:</i> the Jews were such notorious offenders. But in what had they injured the Chaldeans? --- <i>Beauty.</i> Hebrew, "dwelling or fold."'
      v:008:
        - 'JER:50:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Kids;</i> rams. This comparison was not ignoble. Go boldly out of the city, before it be besieged.'
      v:009:
        - 'JER:50:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Nations.</i> Cyrus had Armenians, &c., in his army. (Calmet) --- <i>Thence,</i> by the bed of the Euphrates, the waters of which were mostly let out into the marshes. Thus the city was taken, while the people were feasting. (Herodotus i. 191.) --- Aristotle (Pol. iii. 3.) says, three days passed before all the citizens were apprised of its fate, it was so extensive: but this is incredible. If we follow the account of Berosus, Cyrus routed Nabonides, who fled to Borsippe, while he took Babylon and demolished the outer walls. (Josephus, contra Apion i.) (Calmet) --- <i>North,</i> with respect to Babylon. (Worthington) --- The Persians lay rather to the south, and to the east of Palestine, (Haydock) if our maps be accurate. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'JER:50:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Bulls.</i> You have rioted in Juda, and treated my people cruelly. (Haydock) --- In Hebrew four verbs have improperly <i>i</i> for <i>v;</i> but [in] chap. li. 34., <i>v</i> supplants <i>i</i> five times. (Kennicott)'
      v:012:
        - 'JER:50:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Dust,</i> like a suppliant, Isaias xlvii. 1. (Calmet) --- <i>Dry.</i> The country shall be equally unfruitful. The waters of the Euphrates being let off, gave a passage to the enemy, ver. 9. (Haydock) --- Babylon soon lost its splendour. (Calmet) --- Vologeses completed its ruin. (Pliny, [Natural History?] vi. 26.) --- It ceased to be the metropolis or <i>mother</i> city. (Haydock) --- The whole country was laid waste. (Worthington)'
      v:015:
        - 'JER:50:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Hand,</i> to form leagues; or she faints, (Septuagint) and submits, Lamentations v. 6.'

        - 'JER:50:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Harvest.</i> Such were usually unmolested. (Calmet) --- Babylon was so large, that people sowed corn within the walls. (Curt. v.) --- The environs were well cultivated. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xviii. 17.) --- <i>Dove,</i> or the <i>destroyer;</i> for the Hebrew word signifies either the one or the other. (Challoner) (Chap. xxv. 38., and xlvi. 16.) --- Literally, "from before the sword of the dove." The power of Babylon is no more. (Haydock) --- The king is compared to a dove, for his swiftness; or God is meek, though terrible. (Worthington) --- <i>Land.</i> The other nations were set free as well as the Jews. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'JER:50:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Bones.</i> He completely ruined the nation, which the Assyrians had left. (Haydock) --- They led the ten tribes away, and the Chaldeans took the rest, 4 Kings xviii., and xxv. (Worthington)'

      v:021:
        - 'JER:50:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Rulers:</i> the most potent empire of Babylon. --- <i>All.</i> Hebrew, "anathematize them and their posterity."'
      v:023:

      v:031:
        - 'JER:50:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Proud.</i> So the Chaldeans are often styled in the Psalms. (Calmet) --- The prophet addresses Nabuchodonosor, or rather Baltassar, (Menochius) under whom the city was taken, (Josephus, &c.) by Darius and Cyrus. He may be the Nabonides of Berosus, the question is so much perplexed. Yet "we are convinced that Darius reigned at Babylon before Cyrus, and took the city after the death of Baltassar." (Calmet) --- Most commentators are of a different opinion. (Haydock)'
      v:033:
        - 'JER:50:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Israel.</i> Samaria had been destroyed forty-four years before the fourth of Joakim, from which period many of Juda had been captives seventy years, till Cyrus became their deliverer, and chastised the Chaldeans. (Calmet) --- Both kingdoms had been oppressed by a strong hand, till a stronger, even God himself, delivered them. (Worthington)'
      v:034:
        - 'JER:50:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Name.</i> He gives victory to Cyrus. Thus the Lord directs all for the sake of his elect, and laughs at the vain projects of men. (Calmet)'

        - 'JER:50:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Wise men.</i> They were styled Chaldeans, and inhabited a certain part of the city, being employed in astronomical and mathematical observations. They disapproved of those who cast nativities. (Strabo xvi.)'
      v:036:
        - 'JER:50:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Diviners.</i> Hebrew, "impostors." They were nowhere more plentiful, Daniel i. 20. Fortune-tellers were consulted on every occasion. The eastern nations are still much addicted to this superstition.'
      v:038:
        - 'JER:50:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Drought.</i> Cyrus almost drained the Euphrates, chap. li. 42., and Isaias xxi. --- <i>Things,</i> fit to terrify children, Baruch vi. 14. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "they are made upon their idols." (Haydock)'
      v:039:
        - 'JER:50:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Fig-fauns.</i> Monsters of the desert, or demons in monstrous shapes; such as the ancients called <i>fauns</i> and <i>satyrs:</i> and as they imagined them to live upon wild figs, they called them <i>fauni-ficarii,</i> or <i>fig-fauns.</i> (Challoner) --- Maldonat reads <i>sicariis,</i> "ruffians." Sixtus V and St. Jerome, (in Isaias xiii. 21.) have <i>fatuis,</i> "foolish wild men." Hebrew, "the <i>Tsiim</i> with the <i>iim</i> shall dwell there, and the daughters of the <i>Yahana</i> (Haydock; swans) shall there reside," or "<i>fishermen</i> among the <i>rushes</i> shall dwell," &c. --- <i>Ever.</i> Its situation is unknown.

      v:002:
        - 'JER:51:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Fan her.</i> After the corn was trodden out, it was heaved into the wind. This custom would insinuate the distress and captivity of the Chaldeans. Septuagint, "I will send....scoffers, and they shall treat her with scorn, {GREEK:START kathubriousin}καθυβριουσιν{GREEK:END}. (Haydock) --- They have read (Calmet) <i>zedim</i> for <i>zarim.</i>'
      v:003:
        - 'JER:51:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Mail.</i> There will be little or no resistance made, chap. l. 3. (Haydock) --- The Persians denounce destruction to all taken in arms; or, according to Septuagint and Syriac they exhort each other to fight. (Calmet) --- "Let him," &c. (Haydock) --- Hebrew of the Masorets, "you who bend....spare not." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow," &c. (Haydock) --- Hebrew is printed <i>ne tendat tendat tendans.</i> The second word is properly omitted in some manuscripts. Thus (1 Chronicles xxiv. 6.) we read <i>taken taken, achuz</i> having been put erroneously for <i>achad,</i> one. (Kennicott)'
      v:005:
        - 'JER:51:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Forsaken,</i> as a widow, <i>viduatus.</i> (Haydock) --- God still considers the nation as his spouse. --- <i>Their land.</i> That of the Chaldeans, (Calmet) or of the Jews. (Theodoret) --- <i>Sin,</i> or punishment.'
      v:006:
        - 'JER:51:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Silent.</i> Jews proclaim that Babylon is justly punished, (Calmet) <i>lest you partake in her crimes,</i> Apocalypse xviii. 4. Protestants, "be not cut off in her," &c. (Haydock)'

        - 'JER:51:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Cup.</i> She has exercised the vengeance of the Lord on Juda, Egypt, &c.'

      v:009:
        - 'JER:51:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>We.</i> The guardian angels, or Jews reply. Miracles are lost on her. --- <i>Heavens.</i> Her crimes call for punishment, Genesis xviii. 21., and Jonas i. 2.'
      v:010:
        - 'JER:51:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Justices.</i> We had not injured the Chaldeans, though we had offended God.'
      v:011:
        - 'JER:51:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Sharpen.</i> He addresses ironically the citizens of Babylon. --- <i>Medes.</i> Thus the subjects of the Persian monarchs are commonly styled. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'JER:51:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Standard.</i> Call together thy subjects and allies. (Haydock) --- This must be explained of Babylon. (Menochius) --- Yet all will be in vain, ver. 11. (Haydock) --- <i>Ambushes.</i> Herein the valour and genius of heroes was most displayed, Josue viii. 2. (Homer)'
      v:013:
        - 'JER:51:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Waters.</i> Not far from the Tigris, and divided into two parts by the Euphrates. (Calmet) --- <i>Entire,</i> being cut up by the roots, <i>pedalis,</i> (Lyranus) or according to the measure of thy crimes. (Delrio) (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "thy end is truly come into thy bowels." (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - 'JER:51:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Himself.</i> Septuagint, "his hand" lifted up, or by his power. --- <i>Locusts.</i> Their ravages were equally dreaded, Joel ii. 4., and Judges vi. 5.'
      v:016:
        - JER:51:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Rain.</i> Thunder and lightning are usually followed by showers. (Calmet)
      v:017:
        - 'JER:51:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Every man,</i> &c. That is, every maker of idols, however he boasts of his knowledge and skill, does but shew himself a fool in pretending to make a god. (Challoner) (Wisdom xiv. 18.) --- <i>By his,</i> or "by default of knowledge;" (<i>a scientia.</i> Haydock) as the Hebrew may also mean. The Babylonians were so confounded, they knew not what to do. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "Every man is brutish by his knowledge." Marginal note, or "is more brutish than to know," chap. x. 14. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'JER:51:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Thou,</i> Cyrus, (Grotius) or more commonly the Chaldeans are understood.'
      v:025:
        - 'JER:51:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Mountain.</i> So Babylon is styled in derision. See chap. xxi. 13., and Isaias i. 10., and xx. 6., and xxii. 1. The city stood on a plain. Some think that its palace and walls are designated. --- <i>Burnt;</i> unfruitful. This happened long after Cyrus, though it then ceased to be the capital, and became only a shadow of its former greatness.'
      v:026:
        - 'JER:51:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Corner.</i> No king or conqueror shall spring thence. Alexander [the Great] thought of making it the seat of his empire, but was prevented by death. (Strabo xv.)'

(Worthington) --- Many religious ceremonies were used. --- <i>Ararat,</i> where the ark rested, (Genesis viii. 4.) near the Araxes, (St. Jerome, in Isaias xxxvii.) or in the Gordyean mountains, in Armenia, where the <i>Menni</i> dwelt. --- <i>Ascenez,</i> or Ascantes, (Calmet) near the Tanais. (Pliny, [Natural History?] vi. 7.) --- <i>Taphsar,</i> "the prince," Nahum iii. 17. (Pagnin) "Warriors." (Chaldean) "Machines" (Septuagint) --- <i>Caterpillar,</i> or "locust," (<i>bruchum.</i> Haydock) which resembles more a body of cavalry. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "Push forward the cavalry against her, as a multitude of locusts." (Haydock)'
      v:028:
        - 'JER:51:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Prepare;</i> "sanctify." (Haydock) --- <i>Media.</i> Cyrus, ver. 11. --- <i>Captains:</i> generals. (Calmet) --- <i>Rulers.</i> Literally, "magistrates."

      v:031:
        - 'JER:51:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>King,</i> feasting in his palace, (Herodotus i. 191.) or at Borsippe. (Berosus) He sent to make inquiries, (Calmet) or his subjects hastened to convey the doleful tidings, and thus met each other. (Haydock)'
      v:032:
        - 'JER:51:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Fords.</i> Thus the enemy entered. --- <i>Marches.</i> Hebrew, "sedges," which grew to the size of trees, and were burnt when the waters of the river and lakes were drained.

      v:033:
        - 'JER:51:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Threshing,</i> performed by oxen treading, and by rollers, &c., Judges viii. 16., and 2 Kings xii. 31. --- <i>Little;</i> about fifty-six years.'
      v:034:
        - "JER:51:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Dragon,</i> or huge fish, which swallows without chewing. Sion is here venting her complaint, Psalm cxxxvi. 8. (Calmet) --- She shews that Babylon is justly punished for her cruelty towards God's people. (Worthington)"
      v:036:
        - 'JER:51:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Spring;</i> commerce, the source of her riches; or rather the waters shall be brought out of their usual channels. For many ages (Calmet) the Euphrates has been lost in sands, and reaches not the Persian Gulf. (Pliny, [Natural History?] vii. 27.) (Cellar. iii. 16.)'
      v:037:
        - 'JER:51:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Dragons.</i> This has been the case for above sixteen centuries, chap. l. 31., and Isaias xiii. 21.'
      v:038:
        - 'JER:51:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Roar.</i> They shall retain their haughty air and threaten others, when they themselves shall fall (Calmet) in the midst of their feasting, Daniel v. 30. (Xenophon vii.)'

      v:042:
        - 'JER:51:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>Sea:</i> numerous armies of Cyrus, or the waters of the Euphrates let loose. (Calmet) --- In the days of Alexander [the Great], many tombs of the kings were inundated. (Strabo xv.)'
      v:044:
        - 'JER:51:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>Down.</i> His priests pretended that he eat, (Daniel xiv. 11.) and a woman of their choice slept in the most retired part of the temple. (Herodotus i. 181.) --- The prophet derides this notion. The idol, or rather his votaries, (Haydock) shall be forced to let go the Israelites. (Calmet) --- <i>Fall,</i> by means of Cyrus and of Darius, chap. l. 3. (Haydock)'
      v:046:
        - "JER:51:46 | 46 | 46 | <i>Faint.</i> You may apprehend that your miseries will increase in the midst of such confusion; but no, Baltassar, the last of your oppressor's race, shall be assassinated by Neriglissor, who will be succeeded by Laborosoarchod and Nabonides. This last shall yield to Cyrus, who will grant you liberty. Baltassar reigned two years, Neriglissor four, his ill-tempered infant son nine months, when his followers murdered him, and gave the crown to a Babylonian called Nabonides, who kept it seventeen years, till Cyrus took him prisoner. This we learn from Berosus, quoted by Josephus, contra Apion i. On the other hand Daniel makes Darius, the Mede, succeed Baltassar, and after him Cyrus reigned. To these changes and continual alarms the prophet alludes."
      v:047:
        - 'JER:51:47 | 47 | 47 | <i>Idols;</i> Bel, &c., ver. 41. --- <i>Slain.</i> Hebrew, "dancers." The people were feasting. (Calmet) --- It means also "slain," (Protestants) or "soldiers."'

      v:051:
        - 'JER:51:51 | 51 | 51 | <i>We.</i> The Jews answer: we are ashamed when we think of these places. (Menochius)'
      v:053:
        - 'JER:51:53 | 53 | 53 | <i>High.</i> Her fortifications and ditches will prove fruitless, chap. xlviii. 7, 18.'

        - 'JER:51:57 | 57 | 57 | <i>Drunk,</i> with the wine of fury, ver. 39., and chap. xxv. 26.'
      v:058:
        - 'JER:51:58 | 58 | 58 | <i>Broad wall.</i> The pagan historians agree not in the dimensions, but allow it was excessively broad and lofty. (Calmet) --- Six chariots might go abreast. It was 360 stadia long, (Ctesias); or 480 (Herodotus i. 178.) that is above 23 leagues, allowing 2,500 paces for each. This author says the breadth was fifty cubits of the <i>king,</i> three inches larger than the common one, or about twenty-one inches. Pliny ([Natural History?] vi. 26.) improperly applies this to Roman feet, and says the walls were two hundred feet high; while Herodotus assigns so many cubits. (Calmet) --- There were three different walls. (Curt. v.) --- Cyrus demolished the outer one. (Berosus) --- What remained, (Calmet) with the hundred brazen gates, Darius treated in like manner. (Herodotus i. 179., and iii. 159.) --- Thus was the prediction fulfilled, and the works of so many captive nations brought to nothing. It is asserted that 200,000 (Calmet) daily finished a stadium, (Curt. v.) or 125 paces. (Calmet)'
      v:059:
        - "JER:51:59 | 59 | 59 | <i>With.</i> Hebrew also, (Calmet) \"on behalf of.\" (Protestant marginal note) (Haydock) --- It is no where else asserted that Sedecias went in person, and Septuagint, Chaldean, &c., explain it in this manner. Baruch accompanied his brother Saraias, and probably took the letter, Baruch i. 2. Saraias went to petition for the sacred vessels. --- <i>Prophecy,</i> or of the embassy to speak (Calmet) in the king's name. Hebrew <i>menucha,</i> was a caution of Benjamin. It means, \"rest;\" whence some have inferred that he was chamberlain, (Canticle of Canticles iii. 8.) or a favourite. Most translate, \"chief of the presents,\" Septuagint and Chaldean, as if they they had read <i>mincha,</i> which he carried as a tribute to Babylon. Jeremias gave him charge of the parcel, perhaps before Baruch had determined to go."
      v:064:
        - 'JER:51:64 | 64 | 64 | <i>Sink.</i> The angel did the like; (Apocalypse xviii. 21.; Calmet) and the Phoceans, leaving their country, swore that they would return no more till a piece of red hot iron, which they threw into the sea, should swim. (Herodotus i. 165.) --- <i>Thus,</i> &c., was added by the compiler. Septuagint omit the sentence, as what relates to Babylon is placed [in] chap. xxviii. in their copies. (Calmet) --- Yet Grabe puts it in a different character. (Haydock) --- Jeremias wrote a great deal, after the 4th year of Sedecias, ver. 59. (Calmet) --- He here finished his predictions against Babylon. (Worthington) --- This does not mean that he did not write the next chapter, (Menochius) as Cappel allows, (Houbigant) though this may still be doubted. (Haydock)'

      v:045: 'JER:51:45 | 45 | 45 | Go out of the midst of her, my people; that every man may save his life from the fierce wrath of the Lord.'
      v:046: 'JER:51:46 | 46 | 46 | And lest your hearts faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land: and a rumour shall come in one year, and after this year <i>another</i> rumour: and iniquity in the land, and ruler upon ruler.'
      v:047: 'JER:51:47 | 47 | 47 | Therefore, behold the days come, and I will visit the idols of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.'
      v:048: 'JER:51:48 | 48 | 48 | And the heavens and the earth, and all things that are in them shall give praise for Babylon: for spoilers shall come to her from the north, saith the Lord.'
      v:049: JER:51:49 | 49 | 49 | And as Babylon caused that there should fall slain in Israel; so of Babylon there shall fall slain in all the earth.

      v:054: 'JER:51:54 | 54 | 54 | The noise of a cry from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:'
      v:055: 'JER:51:55 | 55 | 55 | Because the Lord hath laid Babylon waste, and destroyed out of her the great voice; and their wave shall roar like many waters; their voice hath made a noise:'
      v:056: 'JER:51:56 | 56 | 56 | Because the spoiler is come upon her, that is, upon Babylon, and her valiant men are taken, and their bow is weakened, because the Lord, who is a strong revenger, will surely repay.'
      v:057: 'JER:51:57 | 57 | 57 | And I will make her princes drunk, and her wise men, and her captains, and her rulers, and her valiant men; and they shall sleep an everlasting sleep, and shall awake no more, saith the king, whose name is Lord of hosts.'
      v:058: 'JER:51:58 | 58 | 58 | Thus saith the Lord of hosts: That broad wall of Babylon shall be utterly broken down, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire, and the labours of the people shall come to nothing, and of the nations shall go to the fire and shall perish.'
      v:059: 'JER:51:59 | 59 | 59 | The word that Jeremias, the prophet, commanded Saraias, the son of Nerias, the son of Naasias, when he went with king Sedecias, to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign: now Saraias was chief over the prophecy.'
      v:060: 'JER:51:60 | 60 | 60 | And Jeremias wrote in one book all the evil that was to come upon Babylon: all these words that are written against Babylon.'
      v:061: 'JER:51:61 | 61 | 61 | And Jeremias said to Saraias: When thou shalt come into Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words,'
      v:062: 'JER:51:62 | 62 | 62 | Thou shalt say, O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place to destroy it; so that there should be neither man nor beast to dwell therein, and that it should be desolate for ever.'
      v:063: 'JER:51:63 | 63 | 63 | And when thou shalt have made an end of reading this book, thou shalt tie a stone to it, and shalt throw it into the midst of the Euphrates:'
      v:064: 'JER:51:64 | 64 | 64 | And thou shalt say: Thus shall Babylon sink, and she shall not rise up from the affliction that I will bring upon her, and she shall be utterly destroyed. Thus far <i>are</i> the words of Jeremias.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JER:52:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Sedecias.</i> This is purely historical, taken from 4 Kings xxiv. 18., &c. Many doubt with reason the Jeremias inserted it, as he could not well be alive at the time when Joakim was honoured, ver. 31. If he had written both this and the Book of Kings, the variations which we here discover would not be seen. It seems, therefore, that Esdras or some other has inserted it, to explain the fall of Jerusalem and the lamentations; as a similar addition has been made to Isaias, chap. xxxvi., &c. See Grotius. (Calmet) --- The history occurs more at large, Paralipomenon ultra.[last chapter?] (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - 'JER:52:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Revolted,</i> breaking his oath, which greatly offended God.'
      v:012:
        - "JER:52:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Tenth:</i> 4 Kings <i>seventh,</i> on which day Nabuzardan set out from Reblatha, according to some. But it was above sixty leagues, or hours journey, distant. (Calmet) --- He entered the city on the 7th, and put his orders in execution on the 10th. (Usher) --- Nothing of the king's imprisonment, or of the <i>city</i> poor occurs, 4 Kings."
      v:015:
        - 'JER:52:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Poor.</i> He took those of the city, and left the poor of the country, ver. 16. (Calmet) --- Alexandrian Septuagint omits this verse, which Grabe inserts: <b>16.</b> "And the rest of the people, the chief cook or general, left for," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'JER:52:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Under</i> the sea <i>the bases,</i> (Haydock) or bowls, <i>which,</i> &c.'
      v:023:
        - 'JER:52:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Hundred;</i> four next the wall were not seen, or were <i>fixed</i> to the chaptrels.'
      v:024:
        - 'JER:52:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Second</i> in dignity to the high priest, a chief officer of the temple.'
      v:025:
        - 'JER:52:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Seven:</i> 4 Kings has <i>five.</i> But this seems more correct, as seven were commonly employed, Esther i. 10., and Tobias xii. 15. (Calmet) --- Two might be taken later. (Haydock) --- <i>A scribe.</i> St. Jerome has <i>Sopher,</i> (4 Kings) as if it were a proper name, and not an office.'
      v:028:
        - 'JER:52:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Seventh year</i> of Nabuchodonosor, and last of Joakim, 4 Kings. Roman Septuagint omits this and the next verse, which are found in Theodoret and the Complutensian edition. (Calmet) --- Grabe supplies all from, <i>And Juda,</i> ver 27, to 31. (Haydock) --- Zuinglius observes that the Septuagint have not a fragment of it, and that it has been added by some one to hide the ignominy of the Jews. It is interpolated in the Arabic of the Lond. Polyglot, and seems contrary to the true history, 4 Kings xxiv. 14. (Kennicott, Diss. 2.)'
      v:031:
        - 'JER:52:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Joachin.</i> He had been thrown into prison when 18 years old, and continued there 37 years. It is not probable that Jeremias wrote this. Evilmerodach had also been the same in prison. --- <i>Five:</i> 4 Kings has <i>seven.</i> Probably Nabuchodonosor died on the 25th, and his son then resolved to liberate Joachin; which he did on the 27th.'
      v:032:
        - 'JER:52:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Kings,</i> who had been conquered, and kept at court for parade. (Calmet)'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "<b>Jeremias</b> was a priest, a native of Anathoth, a priestly city, in the tribe of Benjamin, and was sanctified from his mother's womb to be a prophet of God; which office he began to execute when he was yet a child in age. He was in his whole life, according to the signification of his name, <i>great before the Lord,</i> and a special figure of Jesus Christ, in the persecutions he underwent for discharging his duty, in his charity for his persecutors, and in the violent death he suffered at their hands; it being an ancient tradition of the Hebrews, that he was stoned to death by the remnant of the Jews who had retired into Egypt, (Challoner) at Taphnes. His style is plaintive, (Worthington) like that of Simonides, (Calmet) and not so noble as that of Isaias and Osee. (St. Jerome) --- He was the prophet of the Gentiles, as well as of the Jews, predicting many things which befell both, and particularly the liberation of the latter, the year of the world 3485, after the seventy years' captivity, dating from the year of the world 3415, (Calmet) or 3398, the 4th of Joakim. (Usher) (Chap. xxv.) (Haydock) --- He began to prophesy when he was very young, the year of the world 3375, in the 13th year of Josias, (Calmet) before that prince had brought his reformation to any great perfection. (Haydock)"
