    commentary:
      v:000:
        - 'LAM:1:0 | 0 | Preface | <i>And,</i> &c. This preface was not written by Jeremias, but added by the seventy interpreters, to give the reader to understand upon what occasion the Lamentations were published. (Challoner) --- The author is not known, (Worthington) and few assert with Gretser that it is canonical; as it is only a title, (Calmet) like those prefixed to the Psalms. (Haydock) --- It is not found in Hebrew, Chaldean, Syriac, or St. Jerome. (Calmet)'
      v:001:
        - 'LAM:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>City.</i> David had conquered many. Jerusalem was long considered as the finest city in those parts. --- <i>Tributary.</i> It had been so to the Assyrians, Egyptians, and Chaldeans, 4 Kings xxiv. 1. From this and similar passages, it would seem that the city was still existing: yet in others it appears to have been demolished. Here then the prophet declares what it had been: (Calmet) unless he wrote part after the death of Josias. (Haydock) --- The beholders are astonished at the change and misery of the city. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - 'LAM:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Night;</i> privately, or without ceasing. --- <i>Friends,</i> who had made a league with Sedecias, chap. xxvii. 3., and xlviii. 26.'
      v:003:
        - 'LAM:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Rest.</i> Many returning to join Godolias, chap. xl. 7. (Calmet) --- The Jews who beheld their brethren led away to Babylon, retired into Egypt, but were in misery. (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - 'LAM:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Feast,</i> thrice a-year. This was the most charming sight, when all the nation met to adore God, and to renew their friendship with one another. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'LAM:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Lords.</i> Literally, "at the head," (Haydock) which Moses had threatened, Deuteronomy xxvi. 1, 43. (Calmet) --- This would be most cutting. (Worthington)'
      v:006:
        - "LAM:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Beauty;</i> princes' palaces, but particularly the temple, ver. 10. (Calmet) --- <i>Rams,</i> fleeing from place to place to seek relief. (Worthington)"
      v:007:
        - 'LAM:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Of all.</i> She compares her past happiness with her present chastisement. --- <i>Sabbaths,</i> or days of rest. The pagans derided them as so much lost time. <i>Ignava et partem vitæ non attigit ullam.</i> (Juvenal v.; Seneca, apud St. Augustine, City of God vi. 11.) --- If none of their legislators thought of such an institution, it was because they had not the spirit of Moses: their feasts were dissolute. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - "LAM:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Unstable.</i> Hebrew also, \"removed,\" (Haydock) like a woman unclean. (Calmet) --- Such were excluded from places of prayer, and were not allowed to touch a sacred book, or to pronounce God's name. Their husbands could not look at their face, nor give them any thing, but laid it down for them to take. (Buxtorf, Syn. 31.) --- No condition could be more distressing. (Calmet)"
      v:009:
        - 'LAM:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>End</i> in her prosperity, to avert this misfortune. (Haydock) --- Idolatry is a spiritual adultery, (Worthington) and one of the worst species of filth. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - 'LAM:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Church.</i> Deuteronomy xxxiii. 1., and Ezechiel xliv. 9. The Chaldeans disregarded the ordinance.'
      v:011:
        - 'LAM:1:11 | 11 | 11-12 | <i>O.</i> Hebrew of the Masorets, "It is." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "Is it nothing to you, all?" &c. (Haydock) --- But the Vulgate is much clearer, and approved by many Protestants, <i>lu</i> being often used as an exclamation, Genesis xvii. 18. (Calmet) --- <i>Vintage.</i> He has plundered all, ver. 22. (Haydock) --- The king took a great deal, and his general the rest, 4 Kings xxiv., and xxv. (Worthington)'
      v:013:
        - 'LAM:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Bones:</i> fortresses. (Theodoret) --- I am like one in a burning fever, Ezechiel xxiv. 4. (Calmet) --- <i>Chastised.</i> Literally, "instructed." This is the good effect of affliction. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - 'LAM:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Watched.</i> This metaphor is not too harsh, chap. xxxi. 28. The Masorets prefer, (Calmet) "is bound by his hand." (Protestants) But <i>miskad</i> is explained (Haydock) by the Septuagint, &c., in the sense of the Vulgate. God lays the yoke on my neck suddenly. My iniquities are like bands, and Nabuchodonosor has power over me.'
      v:015:
        - 'LAM:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Mighty.</i> Hebrew, "magnificent" princes, (Luke xxii. 25.) or warriors. --- <i>Time</i> of vengeance. All is animated. Hebrew also, "a troop" of Chaldeans, chap. ii. 22. --- <i>Juda.</i> God, as the first cause, punishes the Jews by war.'
      v:017:
        - 'LAM:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Then.</i> They surround the city, to starve the inhabitants, ver. 8.'
      v:019:
        - 'LAM:1:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Me.</i> Egypt attempted to relieve Juda, to no purpose, ver. 2. (Calmet) --- It could not, or at least did not, prove of any service to the Jews, chap. ii. 18. (Worthington)'
      v:020:
        - 'LAM:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Alike,</i> by famine, &c. (Calmet) (Worthington) --- <i>Ubique pavor et plurima mortis imago.</i> (Virgil, Æneid ii.)'
      v:021:
        - 'LAM:1:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Done it.</i> They conclude that I am cast off for ever. But when I shall be comforted, their turn will come; (Calmet) or rather they will feel the scourge soon after me. --- <i>Consolation.</i> Hebrew, "which thou hast appointed." (Haydock) (Chap. xlviii. 26., &c., and Ezechiel xxv., &c.)'
      v:022:
        - 'LAM:1:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Let.</i> He prays not for their ruin, but predicts it; and wishes rather that they would be converted. (Calmet)'

      v:002: 'LAM:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Beth</i>. {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Weeping, she hath wept in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: there is none to comfort her among all them that were dear to her: all her friends have despised her, and are become her enemies.'
      v:003: 'LAM:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Ghimel</i>. Juda hath removed her dwelling-place, because of her affliction, and the greatness of her bondage; she hath dwelt among the nations, and she hath found no rest; all her persecutors have taken her in the midst of straits.'
      v:004: 'LAM:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Daleth</i>. The ways of Sion mourn, because there are none that come to the solemn feast: all her gates are broken down; her priests sigh; her virgins are in affliction; and she is oppressed with bitterness.'
      v:005: 'LAM:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>He</i>. Her adversaries are become her lords; her enemies are enriched; because the Lord hath spoken against her for the multitude of her iniquities; her children are led into captivity, before the face of the oppressor.'
      v:006: 'LAM:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Vau</i>. And from the daughter of Sion, all her beauty is departed; her princes are become like rams, that find no pastures; and they are gone away without strength before the face of the pursuer.'
      v:007: "LAM:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Zain</i>. Jerusalem hath remembered the days of her affliction, and prevarication of all her desirable things which she had from the days of old, when her people fell in the enemy's hand, and there was no helper; the enemies have seen her, and have mocked at her sabbaths."
      v:008: 'LAM:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Heth</i>. Jerusalem hath grievously sinned, therefore is she become unstable; all that honoured her, have despised her, because they have seen her shame; but she sighed, and turned backward.'
      v:009: 'LAM:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Teth</i>. Her filthiness is on her feet, and she hath not remembered her end; she is wonderfully cast down, not having a comforter: behold, O Lord, my affliction, because the enemy is lifted up.'
      v:010: 'LAM:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Jod</i>. The enemy hath put out his hand to all her desirable things; for she hath seen the Gentiles enter into her sanctuary, of whom thou gavest commandment that they should not enter into thy church.'
      v:011: 'LAM:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Caph</i>. All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given all their precious things for food to relieve the soul: see, O Lord, and consider, for I am become vile.'
      v:012: 'LAM:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Lamed</i>. O all ye that pass by the way, attend, and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow; for he hath made a vintage of me, as the Lord spoke in the day of his fierce anger.'
      v:013: 'LAM:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Mem</i>. From above he hath sent fire into my bones, and hath chastised me; he hath spread a net for my feet; he hath turned me back; he hath made me desolate, wasted with sorrow all the day long.'
      v:014: 'LAM:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Nun</i>. The yoke of my iniquities hath watched; they are folded together in his hand, and put upon my neck; my strength is weakened; the Lord hath delivered me into a hand, out of which I am not able to rise.'
      v:015: 'LAM:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Samech</i>. The Lord hath taken away all my mighty men out of the midst of me; he hath called against me the time, to destroy my chosen men; the Lord hath trodden the wine-press for the virgin daughter of Juda.'
      v:016: 'LAM:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Ain</i>. {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Therefore do I weep, and my eyes run down with water, because the comforter, the relief of my soul, is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy hath prevailed.'
      v:017: 'LAM:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Phe</i>. Sion hath spread forth her hands, there is none to comfort her: the Lord hath commanded against Jacob, his enemies are round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.'
      v:018: 'LAM:1:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Sade</i>. The Lord is just, for I have provoked his mouth to wrath; hear, I pray you, all ye people, and see my sorrow: my virgins, and my young men are gone into captivity.'
      v:019: 'LAM:1:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Coph</i>. I called for my friends, but they deceived me: my priests and my ancients pined away in the city, while they sought their food, to relieve their souls.'
      v:020: 'LAM:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Res</i>. Behold, O Lord, for I am in distress, my bowels are troubled; my heart is turned within me, for I am full of bitterness: abroad the sword destroyeth, and at home there is death alike.'
      v:021: 'LAM:1:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Sin</i>. They have heard that I sigh, and there is none to comfort me; all my enemies have heard of my evil, they have rejoiced that thou hast done it: thou hast brought a day of consolation, and they shall be like unto me.'
      v:022: 'LAM:1:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Thau</i>. Let all their evil be present before thee; and make vintage of them, as thou hast made vintage of me for all my iniquities: for my sighs are many, and my heart is sorrowful.'

      v:021: 'LAM:2:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Sin</i>. The child and the old man lie without on the ground: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword: thou hast slain them in the day of thy wrath: thou hast killed, and shewn them no pity.'
      v:022: 'LAM:2:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Thau</i>. Thou hast called, as to a festival, those that should terrify me round about, and there was none in the day of the wrath of the Lord that escaped and was left: those that I brought up, and nourished, my enemy hath consumed them.'

(St. Augustine, City of God xviii. 33.) --- It literally speaks of Josias, or of Sedecias. (Worthington) --- Josias was slain by the Egyptians. (St. Jerome, in Zacharias xii.) --- But Sedecias seems chiefly to be meant. The people were much attached to him, though he was wicked; and they expected that he would have rescued them from the power of the Chaldeans, as his league with the neighbouring Gentiles (Calmet) seemed to insure, (Haydock) if they had proved faithful.

      v:002: "LAM:4:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Beth</i>. The noble sons of Sion, and they that were clothed with the best gold: how are they esteemed as earthen vessels, the work of the potter's hands?"
      v:003: 'LAM:4:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Ghimel</i>. Even the sea-monsters have drawn out the breast, they have given suck to their young, the daughter of my people is cruel, like the ostrich of the desert.'
      v:004: 'LAM:4:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Daleth</i>. The tongue of the sucking child hath stuck to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the little ones have asked for bread, and there was none to break it unto them.'
      v:005: 'LAM:4:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>He</i>. They that were fed delicately have died in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet, have embraced the dung.'
      v:006: 'LAM:4:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Vau</i>. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is made greater than the sin of Sodom, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}which was overthrown in a moment, and hands took nothing in her.'
      v:007: 'LAM:4:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Zain</i>. Her Nazarites <i>were</i> whiter than snow, purer than milk, more ruddy than the old ivory, fairer than the sapphire.'
      v:008: 'LAM:4:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Heth</i>. Their face is <i>now</i> made blacker than coals, and they are not known in the streets: their skin hath stuck to their bones, it is withered, and is become like wood.'
      v:009: 'LAM:4:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Teth</i>. It was better with them that were slain by the sword, than with them that died with hunger: for these pined away, being consumed for want of the fruits of the earth.'
      v:010: 'LAM:4:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Jod</i>. The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.'

      v:013: 'LAM:4:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Mem</i>. For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.'
      v:014: 'LAM:4:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Nun</i>. They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they were defiled with blood: and when they could not <i>help walking in it,</i> they held up their skirts.'
      v:015: 'LAM:4:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Samech</i>. Depart, you that are defiled, they cried out to them: Depart, get ye hence, touch not: for they quarrelled, and being removed, they said among the Gentiles: He will no more dwell among them.'
      v:016: 'LAM:4:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Phe</i>. The face of the Lord hath divided them, he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, neither had they pity on the ancients.'
      v:017: 'LAM:4:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Ain</i>. While we were yet standing, our eyes failed, expecting help for us in vain, when we looked attentively towards a nation that was not able to save.'

      v:021: 'LAM:4:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Sin</i>. Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Hus: to thee also shall the cup come, thou shalt be made drunk, and naked.'
      v:022: 'LAM:4:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Thau</i>. Thy iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Sion, he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he visited thy iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he hath discovered thy sins.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'LAM:5:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>The prayer,</i> &c. This title is not in Hebrew, Septuagint, &c. Theodoret has passed over the chapter, as if he doubted of its authenticity. It does not follow the order of Hebrew letters like the preceding, and seems to be a form of prayer for those who retired into Egypt. (Calmet) --- Jeremias foresees what would happen, and prays as the people would do. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - LAM:5:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Aliens.</i> The Idumeans seized and kept possession of the southern parts.
      v:003:
        - 'LAM:5:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Father.</i> Many had none surviving, and all had lost their king. (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - LAM:5:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Water.</i> Even this was not given for nothing.
      v:006:
        - 'LAM:5:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Hand;</i> engaged to serve Egyptians, Babylonians, (Calmet) or other nations, to procure sustenance. (Worthington)'
      v:007:
        - 'LAM:5:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Iniquities.</i> This was the usual complaint of the Jews, (chap. xxxi. 29.) as if they had committed no offence themselves. If any virtuous people were involved in the common ruin, they bore it with resignation, and acknowledged that they had deserved it, 1 Esdras ix. 6., and 2 Esdras i. 6., and Esther xiv. 6., and Daniel iii. 29.'
      v:008:
        - 'LAM:5:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Servants.</i> One had command over another, Matthew xxiv. 45. The Chaldeans were like slaves, and the race of Cham was condemned to servitude, Genesis ix. 26. (Calmet) --- The Jews had formerly dominion over Edom, &c., who now treated them so cruelly. (Menochius) (Lyranus)'
      v:009:
        - LAM:5:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Sword.</i> Any one might kill us.
      v:011:
        - 'LAM:5:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Oppressed.</i> Hebrew, "afflicted." Brutal insolence prevailed. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'LAM:5:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Hand.</i> Thus Leonidas was treated, after his head was cut off, by Xerxes. (Herodotus vii. 238.)'
      v:013:
        - 'LAM:5:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Indecently,</i> like the Sodomites. Hebrew, "they made the young men grind" at the mill, in their prison, (Haydock) as Samson (Judges xvi. 21.) and Sedecias (according to the Septuagint, chap. lii. 11.) were forced to do. To grind is often used in a bad sense; but it is not necessary to adopt it here. (Calmet) (Amama) --- The Chaldeans treated their captives without pity or shame. (Haydock) --- <i>Wood;</i> burdens, or stumbling-blocks, unless they were crucified; or, "roasted," if we admit a small alteration in the Hebrew, chap. iv. 10. (Calmet) --- They were forced to grind naked, and were beaten with staves. (Worthington)'
      v:014:
        - 'LAM:5:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Gates,</i> where sentence was usually passed. (Haydock) --- The Jews had judges at Babylon, (Daniel xiii. 5.) but not at first, nor everywhere.'
      v:016:
        - 'LAM:5:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Crown,</i> used at feasts; (Calmet) or, we have lost the sovereign power. (Worthington)'
      v:017:
        - 'LAM:5:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Dim,</i> the natural consequence of extreme want, 1 Kings xiv. 27.'
      v:018:
        - 'LAM:5:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Foxes,</i> which were very common, Judges xv. 4. Thus, Horace says:{JOIN}{BQ:2}Agros atque lares patrios, habitandaque fana{JOIN}{BQ:2}Apris relinquet et edacibus lupis. (Epod. 16.)'
      v:021:
        - 'LAM:5:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Convert.</i> Thy grace must work upon our hearts, (Calmet) before we can expect redress, (Haydock) and an end of our banishment. (Tirinus) (Grotius) --- <i>Beginning,</i> when our fathers observed the law. (St. Thomas Aquinas) (Menochius) See chap. xxxi. 18.; St. Augustine, City of God ii., and iv. (Worthington)'
      v:022:
        - 'LAM:5:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Thou hast.</i> We might read with an interrogation, (Haydock) in Hebrew, "Hast thou?" &c. The Jews superstitiously repeat the last verse, for fear of ending the book in an ominous manner, as they do at the end of Isaias and Malachias. (Calmet) --- Having treated us so severely, stop thy hand. (Worthington) --- But I perceive it will be in vain to beg for redress till the seventy years be expired. (Menochius)'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "In these <b>Jeremias</b> laments in a most pathetic manner the miseries of his people, and the destruction of <b>Jerusalem</b> and the temple, in Hebrew verses, beginning with different letters according to the order of the Hebrew alphabet. (Challoner) --- In the first chapter the order is exactly observed, but in the three next <i>phe</i> comes before <i>ain,</i> either for some mystery to us unknown, or by the derangement of transcribers, who perhaps thought that those verses were better connected, as they seem to be, (Calmet) though this is not very clear. (Haydock) --- In such pieces the sentiments of a pensive heart are poured out without much connection. (Worthington) --- The Greeks style this word {GREEK:START threnoi}θρηνοι{GREEK:END}, and Hebrew <i>kinoth,</i> or lamentations. (Haydock) --- St. Jerome, (2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 25.) thinks it was the first composition of Jeremias, and sung at the death of Josias. (Worthington) (St. Jerome, in Zacharias xii. 11.) --- The eulogy of the king seems to belong to him rather than to Sedecias, chap. iv. 20. (Calmet) --- Yet it might afterwards be applied to the latter, (Haydock) and to the ruin of Jerusalem, Ecclesiasticus xlix. 8. (St. Jerome, Pref.; Theodoret, &c.) --- The city is represented standing, and sometimes in ruins. Chap. v. seems to have been written after the rest, ver. 4, 18. (Calmet) --- It is not acrostic like them. The prophet alludes to the wretched condition of the Jews, after the murder of their Messias; and hence the Church makes use of the lamentations on the anniversary of our Saviour's passion, inviting all sinners, both Jews and Gentiles, to repent: \"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, be converted to the Lord thy God.\" (Worthington) --- Many passages are applicable to a soul fallen into sin, as the commentary under the name of St. Jerome, (Haydock) compiled by Rabanus, (Du Pin) shews. (Haydock)"
