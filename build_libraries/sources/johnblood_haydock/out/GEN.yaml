      v:001:
        - 'GEN:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Beginning.</i> As St. Matthew begins his Gospel with the same title as this work, <i>the Book of the Generation,</i> or Genesis, so St. John adopts the first words of Moses, <i>in the beginning;</i> but he considers a much higher order of things, even the consubstantial Son of God, <i>the same with God</i> from all eternity, forming the universe, in the beginning of time, in conjunction with the other two Divine Persons, <i>by the word of his power; for all things were made by Him,</i> the Undivided Deity. (Haydock) --- <i>Elohim,</i> the <i>Judges</i> or Gods, denoting plurality, is joined with a verb singular, <i>he created,</i> whence many, after Peter Lombard, have inferred, that in this first verse of Genesis the adorable mystery of the Blessed Trinity is insinuated, as they also gather from various other passages of the Old Testament, though it was not clearly revealed till our Saviour came himself to be the <i>finisher of our faith.</i> (Calmet) --- The Jews being a carnal people and prone to idolatry, might have been in danger of misapplying this great mystery, and therefore an explicit belief of it was not required of them in general. See Collet. &c. (Haydock) --- The word <strong>bara</strong>, <i>created,</i> is here determined by tradition and by reason to mean a production out of nothing, though it be used also to signify the forming of a thing out of pre-existing matter. (ver. 21, 27.) (Calmet) --- The first cause of all things must be God, who, in a moment, spoke, and <i>heaven and earth</i> were made, heaven with all the Angels; and the whole mass of the elements, in a state of confusion, and blended together, out of which the beautiful order, which was afterwards so admirable, arose in the space of six days: thus God was pleased to manifest his free choice in opposition to those Pagans who attributed all to blind chance or fate. <i>Heaven</i> is here placed first, and is not declared <i>empty</i> and dark like the earth; that we may learn to raise our minds and hearts above this land of trial, to that our true country, where we may enjoy God for ever. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - 'GEN:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Spirit of God,</i> giving life, vigour, and motion to things, and preparing the waters for the sacred office of baptism, in which, by the institution of Jesus Christ, we must be born again; and, like spiritual <i>fishes,</i> swim amid the tempestuous billows of this world. (v. Tert.[See Tertullian?], &c.) (Worthington) (Haydock)---This Spirit is what the Pagan philosophers styled the Soul of the World. (Calmet) --- If we compare their writings with the books of Moses and the prophets, we shall find that they agree in many points. See Grotius. (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - "GEN:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Light.</i> The sun was made on the fourth day, and placed in the firmament to distinguish the seasons, &c.; but the particles of fire were created on the first day, and by their, or the earth's motion, served to discriminate day from the preceding night, or <i>darkness,</i> which was <i>upon the face of the deep.</i> (Haydock) --- Perhaps this body of light might resemble the bright cloud which accompanied the Israelites, Exodus xiv. 19, or the three first days might have a kind of imperfect sun, or be like one of our cloudy days. Nothing can be defined with certainty respecting the nature of this primeval light. (Calmet)"
      v:004:
        - 'GEN:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Good;</i> beautiful and convenient: --- <i>he divided light</i> by giving it qualities incompatible with <i>darkness,</i> which is not any thing substantial, and therefore Moses does not say it was created. (Calmet) --- While our hemisphere enjoys the day, the other half of the world is involved in darkness. St. Augustine supposes the fall and punishment of the apostate angels are here insinuated. (L. <i>imp. de Gen.</i>) (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - 'GEN:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>A firmament.</i> By this name is here understood the whole space between the earth and the highest stars. The lower part of which divideth the waters that are upon the earth, from those that are above in the clouds. (Challoner) --- The Hebrew <i>Rokia</i> is translated <i>stereoma,</i> solidity by the Septuagint., and expansion by most of the moderns. The heavens are often represented as a tent spread out, Psalm. ciii. 3. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'GEN:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Above the firmament</i> and stars, according to some of the Fathers; or these waters were vapours and clouds arising from the earth, and really divided from the lower waters contained in the sea. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - "GEN:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Seed in itself,</i> either in the fruit or leaves, or slips. (Menochius) --- At the creation, trees were covered with fruit in Armenia, while in the more northern regions they would not even have leaves: Calmet hence justly observes, that the question concerning the season of the year when the world began, must be understood only with reference to that climate in which Adam dwelt. Scaliger asserts, that the first day corresponds with our 26th of October, while others, particularly the Greeks, fix it upon the 25th of March, on which day Christ was conceived; and, as some Greeks say, was born and nailed to the cross. The great part of respectable authors declare for the vernal equinox, when the year is in all its youth and beauty. (Haydock) See Tirinus and Salien's Annals, B.C. 4053."
      v:014:
        - 'GEN:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>For signs.</i> Not to countenance the delusive observations of astrologers, but to give notice of rain, of the proper seasons for sowing, &c. (Menochius) --- If the sun was made on the first day, as some assert, there is nothing new created on this fourth day. By specifying the use and creation of these heavenly bodies, Moses shows the folly of the Gentiles, who adored them as gods, and the impiety of those who pretend that human affairs are under the fatal influence of the planets. See St. Augustine, Confessions iv. 3. The Hebrew term <i>mohadim,</i> which is here rendered <i>seasons,</i> may signify either <i>months</i>, or the <i>times for assembling</i> to worship God; (Calmet) a practice, no doubt, established from the beginning every week, and probably also the first day of the <i>new moon,</i> a day which the Jews afterwards religiously observed. Plato calls the sun and planets the <i>organs of time,</i> of which, independently of their stated revolutions, man could have formed no conception. The day is completed in twenty-four hours, during which space the earth moves round its axis, and exposes successively different parts of its surface to the sun. It goes at a rate of fifty-eight thousand miles an hour, and completes its orbit in the course of a year. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - "GEN:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Two great lights.</i> God created on the first day <i>light,</i> which being moved from east to west, by its rising and setting made morning and evening. But on the fourth day he ordered and distributed this light, and made the sun, moon, and stars. The moon, though much less than the stars, is here called a <i>great light,</i> from its giving a far greater light to earth than any of them. (Challoner) --- <i>To rule</i> and adorn, for nothing appears so glorious as the sun and moon. (Menochius) --- Many have represented the stars, as well as the sun and moon, to be animated. Ecclesiastes xvi[i. 6?], speaking of the sun says, <i>the spirit goeth forward surveying all places:</i> and in Esdras[2 Esdras?] ix. 6, the Levites address God, <i>Thou hast made heaven and all the host thereof; and thou givest life to all these things, and the host of heaven adoreth thee.</i> St. Augustine <i>Ench.</i> and others, consider this question as not pertaining to faith. See Spencer in Origen, contra Cels. v. (Calmet) --- Whether the stars be the suns of other worlds, and whether the moon, &c. be inhabited, philosophers dispute, without being able to come to any certain conclusion: for <i>God has delivered the world to their consideration for dispute, so that man cannot find out the work which God hath made from the beginning to the end,</i> Ecclesiastes iii. 11. If we must frequently confess our ignorance concerning the things which surround us, how shall we pretend to dive into the designs of God, or subject the mysteries of faith to our feeble reason? If we think the Scriptures really contradict the systems of philosophers, ought we to pay greater deference to the latter, than to the unerring word of God? But we must remember, that the sacred writings were given to instruct us in the way to heaven, and not to unfold to us the systems of natural history; and hence God generally addresses us in a manner best suited to our conceptions, and speaks of nature as it appears to the generality of mankind. At the same time, we may confidently assert, that the Scriptures never assert what is false. If we judge, with the vulgar, that the sun, moon, and stars are no larger than they appear to our naked eye, we shall still have sufficient reason to admire the works of God; but, if we are enabled to discover that the sun's diameter, for example, is 763 thousand miles, and its distance from our earth about 95 million miles, and the fixed stars (as they are called, though probably all in motion) much more remote, what astonishment must fill our breast! Our understanding is bewildered in the unfathomable abyss, in the unbounded expanse, even of the visible creation. --- Sirius, the nearest to us of all the fixed stars, is supposed to be 400,000 times the distance from the sun that our earth is, or 38 millions of millions of miles. Light, passing at the rate of twelve millions of miles every minute, would be nearly 3,000 years in coming to us from the remotest star in our stratum, beyond which are others immensely distant, which it would require about 40,000 years to reach, even with the same velocity. Who shall not then admire thy works and fear thee, O King of ages! (Walker.) --- Geog. justly remarks, \"we are lost in wonder when we attempt to comprehend either the vastness or minuteness of creation. Philosophers think it possible for the universe to be reduced to the smallest size, to an atom, merely by filling up the pores;\" and the reason they allege is, \"because we know not the real structure of bodies.\" Shall any one then pretend to wisdom, and still call in question the mysteries of faith, transubstantiation, &c., when the most learned confess they cannot fully comprehend the nature even of a grain of sand? While on the one hand some assert, that all the world may be reduced to this compass; others say, a grain of sand may be divided <i>in infinitum!</i> (Haydock)"
      v:020:
        - 'GEN:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Creeping:</i> destitute of feet like fishes, which move on their bellies. (Menochius) --- <i>Fowl.</i> Some assert that birds were formed of the earth, but they seem to have the same origin as fishes, namely, water; and still they must not be eaten on days of abstinence, which some of the ancients thought lawful, Socrates v. 20. To conciliate the two opinions, perhaps we might say, that the birds were formed of mud, (Calmet) or that some of the nature of fish, like barnacles, might be made of water and others of earth. (Chap. 11. 19.[ii. 19.?]) --- <i>Under:</i> Hebrew: on the face of the firmament, or in the open air. (Haydock)'
      v:022:
        - 'GEN:1:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Blessed them,</i> or enabled them to produce others. --- <i>Multiply:</i> the immense numbers and variety of fishes and fowls is truly astonishing.'
      v:026:
        - 'GEN:1:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Let us make man to our image.</i> This <i>image</i> of God in man, is not in the body, but in the soul; which is a <i>spiritual</i> substance, endued with understanding and free-will. God speaketh here in the plural number, to insinuate the plurality of <i>persons</i> in the Deity. (Challoner) --- Some of the ancient Jews maintained that God here addressed his council, the Angels; but is it probable that he should communicate to them the title of Creator, and a perfect similitude with himself? (Calmet) --- Man is possessed of many prerogatives above all other creatures of this visible world: his soul gives him a sort of equality with the Angels; and though his body be taken from the earth, like the brutes, yet even here the beautiful construction, the head erect and looking towards heaven, &c. makes St. Augustine observe, an air of majesty in the human body, which raises man above all terrestrial animals, and brings him in some measure near to the Divinity. As Jesus assumed our human nature, we may assert, that we bear a resemblance to God both in soul and body. Tertullian (de Resur. 5.) says, "Thus that slime, putting on already the image of Christ, who would come in the flesh, was not only the work of God, but also a pledge." (Haydock) See St. Bernard on Psalm xcix. (Worthington)'
      v:027:
        - "GEN:1:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Male and female.</i> Eve was taken from Adam's side on this same day, though it be related in the following chapter. Adam was not an hermaphrodite as some have foolishly asserted. (Calmet) --- <i>Adam</i> means <i>the likeness,</i> or <i>red earth,</i> that in one word we may behold our nobility and meanness. (Haydock)"
      v:028:
        - 'GEN:1:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Increase and multiply.</i> This is not a precept, as some protestant controvertists would have it, but a blessing, rendering them fruitful: for God had said the same words to the <em>fishes</em> and <em>birds,</em> (ver. 22.) who were incapable of receiving a precept. (Challoner) --- <i>Blessed them,</i> not only with fecundity as he had done to other creatures, but also with dominion over them, and much more with innocence and abundance of both natural and supernatural gifts. --- <i>Increase.</i> The Hebrews understand this literally as a precept binding every man at twenty years of age (Calmet); and some of the Reformers argued hence, that Priests, &c. were bound to marry: very prudently they have not determined how soon! But the Fathers in general agree that if this were a precept with respect to Adam, for the purpose of <i>filling the earth,</i> it is no longer so, that end being sufficiently accomplished. Does not St. Paul wish all men to be like himself, <i>unmarried?</i> (1 Corinthians vii. 1, 7, 8.) (Haydock)'
      v:029:
        - 'GEN:1:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Every herb,</i> &c. As God does not here express leave to eat flesh-meat, which he did after the deluge, it is supposed that the more religious part of mankind, at least, abstained from it, and from wine, till after that event, when they became more necessary to support decayed nature. (Haydock) (Menochius) --- In the golden age, spontaneous fruits were the food of happy mortals. (Calmet)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'GEN:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Furniture,</i> ornaments or militia, whether we understand the Angels, or the stars, which observe a regular order and obey God. (Menochius)'
      v:002:
        - "GEN:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>He rested,</i> &c. That is, he ceased to make any new kinds of things. Though, as our Lord tells us, John v. 17. <i>He still worketh,</i> viz. by conserving and governing all things, and creating souls. (Challoner) --- <i>Seventh day</i>. This day was commanded, Exodus xx. 8, to be kept holy by the Jews, as it had probably been from the beginning. Philo says, it is the festival of the universe, and Josephus asserts, there is no town which does not acknowledge the religion of the sabbath. But this point is controverted, and whether the ancient patriarchs observed the seventh day, or some other, it is certain they would not fail, for any long time, to shew their respect for God's worship, and would hardly suffer a whole week to elapse without meeting to sound forth his praise. The setting aside of stated days for this purpose, is agreeable to reason, and to the practice of all civilized nations. As the Hebrews kept Saturday holy, in honour of God's rest, so we keep the first day of the week, by apostolic tradition, to thank God for the creation of the world on that day, and much more for the blessings which we derive from the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the sending down of the Holy Ghost, which have given it a title above all other days. (Haydock) --- <i>On the seventh day,</i> at the beginning of this verse, must be taken exclusively, as God finished his work on the 6th, whence the same Septuagint and Syriac have here <i>on the 6th day.</i> (Haydock) --- But the Hebrew and all the other versions agree with the Vulgate. (Calmet) --- The similarity of ver. 6 and ver. 7 in Hebrew may have given rise to this variation. (Haydock)"
      v:004:
        - "GEN:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Day.</i> Not that all things were made in one day: but God formed in succession; first, heaven and earth, then the ornaments of both. <i>Every plant,</i> &c. which on the first day did not spring up, (as <i>water</i> covered the <i>surface of the earth</i>,) on the 3d, by the command of God, without having any man to plant, or rain to water them, pushed forth luxuriantly, and manifested the power of the Creator. (Haydock) --- Thus Christ founded his Church by his own power, and still gives her increase; but requires of his ministers to co-operate with him, as a gardener must now take care of the plants which originally grew without man's aid. (Du Hamel) --- By observing that all natural means were here wanting for the production of plants, God asserts his sole right to the work, and confounds the Egyptian system, which attributed plants, &c. to the general warmth of the earth alone. (Calmet)"
      v:007:
        - 'GEN:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Breath of life</i> or a soul, created out of nothing, and infused into the body to give it life. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'GEN:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Of pleasure,</i> Hebrew <i>Eden,</i> which may be either the name of a country, as chap. iv. 16, or it may signify pleasure, in which sense Symmachus and St. Jerome have taken it. --- <i>From the beginning,</i> or on the 3d day, when all plants were created, Hebrew <i>mikedem,</i> may also mean <i>towards the east,</i> as the Septuagint have understood it, though the other ancient interpreters agree with St. Jerome. Paradise lay probably to the east of Palestine, or of that country where Moses wrote. The precise situation cannot be ascertained. Calmet places it in Armenia, others near Babylon, &c. Some assert that this beautiful garden is still in being, the residence of Henoch and Elias. But God will not permit the curiosity of man to be gratified by the discovery of it, chap. iii. 24. How great might be its extent we do not know. If the sources of the Ganges, Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates, be not now changed, and if these be the rivers which sprung from the fountains of Paradise, (both which are points undecided) the garden must have comprised a great part of the world, (Haydock), as the Ganges rises in Judea [India?], and the Nile about the middle of Africa. (Tirinus)'
      v:009:
        - 'GEN:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>The tree of life.</i> So called, because it had that quality, that by eating of the fruit of it, man would have been preserved in a constant state of health, vigour, and strength, and would not have died at all. <i>The tree of knowledge.</i> To which the deceitful serpent falsely attributed the power of imparting a superior kind of knowledge beyond that which God was pleased to give. (Challoner) --- Of what species these two wonderful trees were, the learned are not agreed. The <i>tree of knowledge,</i> could not communicate any wisdom to man; but, by eating of its forbidden fruit, Adam dearly purchased the knowledge of evil, to which he was before a stranger. Some say it was the fig-tree, others an apple-tree, Canticle of Canticles viii. 5. But it probably agreed with no species of trees with which we are acquainted, nor was there perhaps any of the same kind in paradise. (Tirinus)'
      v:010:
        - 'GEN:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>A river,</i> &c. Moses gives many characteristics of Paradise, inviting us, as it were, to search for it; and still we cannot certainly discover where it is, or whether it exist at all at present, in a state of cultivation. We must therefore endeavour to find the mystic Paradise, Heaven and the true Church; the road to which, though more obvious, is too frequently mistaken. See St. Augustine, City of God xiii. 21.; Proverbs iii. 18. (Haydock)'

      v:017:
        - "GEN:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>The death</i> of the soul, and become obnoxious to that of the body; thou shalt become a mortal and lose all the privileges of innocence. Though Adam lived 930 years after this, he was dying daily; he carried along with him the seeds of death, as we do, from our very conception. He had leave to eat of any fruit in this delicious garden, one only excepted, and this one prohibition makes him more eager to taste of that tree than of all the rest. So we struggle constantly to attain what is forbidden, and covet what is denied, <i>cupimusque negata.</i> God laid this easy command upon Adam, to give him an opportunity of shewing his ready obedience, and to assert his own absolute dominion over him. Eve was already formed, and was apprised of this positive command, (Chap. iii. 3.) and therefore, transgressing, is justly punished with her husband. True obedience does not inquire <i>why</i> a thing is commanded, but submits without demur. Would a parent be satisfied with his child, if he should refuse to obey, because he could not discern the propriety of the restraint? If he should forbid him to touch some delicious fruits which he had reserved for strangers, and the child were to eat them, excusing himself very impertinently and blasphemously, with those much abused words of our Saviour, <i>It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles a man,</i> &c. would not even a Protestant parent be enraged and seize the rod, though he could not but see that he was thus condemning his own conduct, in disregarding, on the very same plea, the fasts and days of abstinence, prescribed by the Church and by God's authority? All meats are good, as that fruit most certainly was which Adam was forbidden to eat; though some have foolishly surmised that it was poisonous; but, the crime of disobedience draws on punishment. (Haydock) --- Even when the sin is remitted, as it was to Adam, the penalty is not of course released, as some have pretended. This also clearly appears in baptized infants, who suffer the penalties due to original sin, as much as those who have not been admitted to the laver of regeneration. (St. Augustine; Worthington; Tirinus, &c.) --- If on this occasion, Eve had alone transgressed, as she was not the head, her sin would have hurt only herself. But with Adam, the representative of all his posterity, God made a sort of compact, (Osee vi. 7.) giving him to understand, that if he continued faithful, his children should be born in the state of innocence like himself, happy and immortal, to be translated in due time to a happier Paradise, &c. but if he should refuse to obey, his sin should be communicated to all his race, who should be, <i>by nature, children of wrath.</i> --- (St. Augustine, City of God xvi. 27; Ven. Bede in Luc. 11; &c.) --- (Haydock) (Calmet)"

These words of Adam are attributed to God, Matthew xix., because they were inspired by him. --- <i>Woman.</i> As this word is derived from man, so in Hebrew <i>Isha</i> (or <i>Asse</i>) comes from <i>Iish</i> or <i>Aiss</i>; Latin <i>vira</i> woman, and <i>virago</i> comes from <i>vir.</i> (Haydock) --- But we do not find this allusion so sensible in any of the Oriental languages, as in the Hebrew, whence another proof arises of this being the original language.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "GEN:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Why hath God?</i> Hebrew, \"Indeed hath God, &c.\" as if the serpent had overheard Eve arguing with herself, about God's prohibition, with a sort of displeasure and presumption. St. Augustine thinks, she had given some entrance to these passions, and the <i>love of her own power,</i> and hence gave credit to the words of the serpent, de Gen. ad lit. xi. 30. She might not know or reflect that the serpent could not reason thus, naturally; and she had as yet, no idea or dread of the devil. (Lombard, 2 Dist. 21.) This old serpent entered into the most subtle of creatures, and either by very expressive signs, or by the motion of the serpent's tongue, held this delusive dialogue with Eve. Moses relates what happened exteriorily; but from many expressions, and from the curse, ver. 15, he sufficiently indicates, that an evil spirit was the latent actor. (Haydock) --- <i>Of every tree.</i> Satan perverts the word of God, giving it an ambiguous turn: in doing which, he has set heretics a pattern, which they follow. (Menochius)"
      v:003:
        - 'GEN:3:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Not touch it.</i> She exaggerates, through dislike of restraint, St. Ambrose. Or through reverence, she thought it unlawful to touch what she must not eat, <i>lest perhaps,</i> as if there could be any doubt. "God asserts, the woman doubts, Satan denies." (St. Bernard) Thus placed, like Eve, between God and the devil, to whom shall we yield our assent? (Haydock) --- <i>Perhaps we die,</i> Hebrew, "lest ye die."'
      v:005:
        - "GEN:3:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>God.</i> The old serpent's aim is, to make us think God envies our happiness. (Haydock) --- Or he would have Eve to suppose, she had not rightly understood her maker, who would surely never deprive her of a fruit which would give her such an increase of knowledge, as to make her conclude she was before comparatively blind. (Menochius) --- <i>As gods,</i> Hebrew <i>Elohim,</i> which means also princes, angels, or judges. It appears, that our first parents had flattered themselves with the hopes of attaining a divine knowledge of all things. (Calmet)"
      v:006:
        - "GEN:3:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Woman saw,</i> or gazed on with desire and fond dalliance. (Menochius) --- Consulting only her senses, which represented the fruit to her as very desirable, and caused her to give credit to the devil's insinuations, rather than to the express word of God. Do not unbelievers the like, when they refuse to admit the real presence and transubstantiation, though they cannot be ignorant, that this way of proceeding always leads to ruin. --- <i>Her husband,</i> who, instead of reproving her for her rashness, <i>did eat,</i> through excessive fondness, not being able to plead ignorance, or that he was deceived. \"Earth trembled from her entrails, sky loured, and muttering thunder, some sad drops wept at completing of the mortal sin.\" --- (Original [Origen?], &c.; [Milton,] Paradise Lost, ix. 1000.) (Haydock) --- (Genesis ii. 14.) In what light soever we consider the fault of this unhappy pair, it is truly enormous: the precept was so easy and just, the attempt to be like God in knowledge so extravagant, that nothing but pride could have suggested such woeful disobedience. <i>By the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners,</i> Romans v. 19. This ruin of himself, and of all his posterity, Adam could not hide from his own eyes, chap. ii. 17. (Calmet)"

Not that they were blind before, (for the <i>woman saw that the tree was fair to the eyes,</i> ver. 6.) nor yet that <i>their eyes were opened</i> to any more perfect knowledge of good; but only to the unhappy experience of having lost the <i>good</i> of original grace and innocence, and incurred the dreadful <i>evil</i> of sin. From whence followed a shame of their being naked; which they minded not before; because being now stript of original grace, they quickly began to be subject to the shameful rebellions of the flesh. (Challoner) --- Behold the noble acquisition of experimental knowledge! This is supposed to have taken place about a week after they had enjoyed the sweets of innocence and of Paradise, that they might afterwards be moved to repentance, when they contrasted their subsequent misery with those few golden days. They saw that they had received a dreadful wound, even in their natural perfections, and that their soul was despoiled of grace, which, of themselves, they could never regain. O! what confusion must now have seized upon them! \"Confounded long they say, as stricken mute.\" (Milton) --- (Haydock){JOIN}<i>Aprons,</i> or they interwove tender branches covered with leaves round their middle; a practice, which even the wild Indians and Americans observed, when they were discovered by Columbus. They will rise up in condemnation of those pretended civilized nations, who, like the Greeks, could wrestle or bathe quite naked, without any sense of shame.

(Menochius) --- <i>Thou gavest me.</i> Heretics have since treated the Sovereign Good with the like insolence; saying plainly, that God is the author of sin, and that the crime of Judas is no less his work than the conversion of St. Paul. See Calvin's works, and many of the first reformers, Luther, &c. cited. (Exodus viii. 15.) (Haydock)"

      v:014:
        - "GEN:3:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Cursed.</i> This curse falls upon the natural serpent, as the instrument of the devil; who is also cursed at the same time by the Holy Ghost. What was natural to the serpent and to man in a state of innocence, (as to creep, &c. to submit to the dominion of the husband, &c.) becomes a punishment after the fall. (St. Chrysostom) --- There was no enmity, before, between man and any of God's creatures; nor were they noxious to him. (Tirinus) --- The devil seems now to crawl, because he no longer aspires after God and heavenly things, but aims at wickedness and mean deceit. (Menochius)"
      v:015:
        - "GEN:3:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>She shall crush.</i> <i>Ipsa,</i> the woman: so divers of the fathers read this place, conformably to the Latin: others read it <i>ipsum,</i> viz. the seed. The sense is the same: for it is by her seed, <i>Jesus Christ,</i> that the woman crushes the serpent's head. (Challoner) --- The Hebrew text, as Bellarmine observes, is ambiguous: He mentions one copy which had <i>ipsa</i> instead of <i>ipsum;</i> and so it is even printed in the Hebrew interlineary edition, 1572, by Plantin, under the inspection of Boderianus. Whether the Jewish editions ought to have more weight with Christians, or whether all the other manuscripts conspire against this reading, let others inquire. The fathers who have cited the old Italic version, taken from the Septuagint agree with the Vulgate, which is followed by almost all the Latins; and hence we may argue with probability, that the Septuagint and the Hebrew formerly acknowledged <i>ipsa,</i> which now moves the indignation of Protestants so much, as if we intended by it to give any divine honour to the blessed Virgin Mary. We believe, however, with St. Epiphanius, that \"it is no less criminal to vilify the holy Virgin, than to glorify her above measure.\" We know that all the power of the mother of God is derived from the merits of her Son. We are no otherwise concerned about the retaining of <i>ipsa,</i> she, in this place, than in as much as we have yet no certain reason to suspect its being genuine. As some words have been corrected in the Vulgate since the Council of Trent by Pope Sixtus V. and others, by Pope Clement VIII. so, if, upon stricter search, it be found that <i>it,</i> and not <i>she,</i> is the true reading, we shall not hesitate to admit the correction: but we must wait in the mean time respectfully, till our superiors determine. (Haydock) Kemnitzius certainly advanced a step too far, when he said that all the ancient fathers read <i>ipsum.</i> Victor, Avitus, St. Augustine, St. Gregory, &c. mentioned in the Douay Bible, will convict him of falsehood. Christ crushed the serpent's head by his death, suffering himself to be wounded in the heel. His blessed mother crushed him likewise, by her co-operation in the mystery of the Incarnation; and by rejecting, with horror, the very first suggestions of the enemy, to commit even the smallest sin. (St. Bernard, ser. 2, on <i>Missus est.</i>) \"We crush,\" says St. Gregory, Mor. 1. 38, \"the serpent's head, when we extirpate from our heart the beginnings of temptation, and then he lays snares for our heel, because he opposes the end of a good action with greater craft and power.\" The serpent may hiss and threaten; he cannot hurt, if we resist him. (Haydock)"
      v:016:
        - 'GEN:3:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>And thy conceptions.</i> Septuagint, "thy groaning." The multifarious sorrows of childbearing, must remind all mothers (the blessed Virgin Mary alone excepted) of what they have incurred by original sin. If that had not taken place, they would have conceived without concupiscence, and brought forth without sorrow. (St. Augustine, City of God xiv. 26.)--- Conceptions are multiplied on account of the many <i>untimely</i> deaths, in our fallen state. <i>Power,</i> which will sometimes be exercised with rigor.

These were created at first, but they would have easily been kept under: now they grow with surprising luxuriancy, and the necessaries of life can be procured only with much labour. All men here are commanded to work, each in his proper department. The Jews were careful to teach their children some trade or useful occupation. St. Paul made tents, and proclaims, <i>If any man will not work, neither let him eat,</i> 2 Thessalonians iii. 10. (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - 'GEN:3:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Dust,</i> as to the visible part; and thy soul created out of nothing. This might serve to correct that pride, by which Adam had fallen; and the same humbling truths are repeated to us by the Church every Ash-Wednesday, to guard us against the same contagion, the worm of pride, to which we are all so liable. Thus Adam was again assured that he should die the death, with which God had threatened him, and which the devil had told Eve would not be inflicted. (Ver. 4.) <i>God created man incorruptible,</i> (<i>inexterminabilem,</i> immortal). <i>But by the envy of the devil, death came into the world,</i> Wisdom ii. 23. (Haydock)'

(Calmet) --- Adam gives his wife this new name, in gratitude for not being cut off by death on the very day of his transgression, as he had every reason to expect and fear he would have been, chap. ii. 17. (Haydock) --- The printed Hebrew reads here, and in many other place, <i>Eva, he,</i> instead of <i>Eja, she;</i> thus, <i>He was the mother,</i> ver. 12, <i>he gave,</i> &c. an inaccuracy unknown to the Samaritan and the best manuscripts copies.

(Haydock)"
      v:022:
        - 'GEN:3:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Behold Adam,</i> &c. This was spoken by way of reproaching him with his pride, in affecting a knowledge that might make him like to God. (Challoner) --- "These are the words of God, not insulting over man, but deterring others from an imitation of his pride." (St. Augustine, de Gen. xi. 39.) --- <i>For ever.</i> The sentence is left imperfect: (Calmet) but by driving man from Paradise, God sufficiently shewed how he would prevent him from eating of the tree of life, (Haydock) which Adam had not yet found. As he was now condemned to be miserable on earth, God, in mercy, prevented him from tasting of that fruit, which would have rendered his misery perpetual. (Menochius) --- He would suffer him to die, that, by death, he might come, after a life of 930 years, spent in sorrow and repentance, to the enjoyment of himself. (Haydock) --- <i>Lest perhaps.</i> God does not exercise his absolute power, or destroy free-will, but makes use of ordinary means and precautions, to effect his designs. (St. Augustine) (Worthington)'
      v:024:
        - 'GEN:3:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Cherubims.</i> Angels of the highest order, and of a very complex figure, unlike any one living creature. Theodoret supposes that God forced Adam to retire from that once charming abode, by the apparition of hideous spectres. The devils were also hindered from coming hither, lest they should pluck the fruit of the tree of life, and by promising immortality, should attract men to their service. <i>The flaming sword,</i> might be a fire rising out of the earth, of which Grotius thinks the pits, near Babylon, are still vestiges. These dreadful indications of the divine wrath would probably disappear, when Paradise had lost its superior beauty, and became confounded with the surrounding countries --- Thus we have seen how rapidly Moses describes the creation of all things, the fall of man, and the promised redemption. But in these few lines, we discover a solution of the many difficulties which have perplexed the learned, respecting these most important subjects. We know that the world is not the effect of chance, but created and governed by divine Providence. We are no longer at a loss to explain the surprising contrast of good and evil, observable in the same man. When we have attentively considered the Old Adam and the New[New Adam, Jesus Christ], we find a clue to lead us through all the labyrinths of our Holy Religion. We could wish, perhaps, for a greater detail in Moses, but he left the rest to be supplied by tradition. He has thrown light enough upon the subjects, to guide the well-disposed, and has left sufficient darkness to humble and to confound the self-conceited and wicked, who love darkness rather than the light. (Calmet) --- Concerning the transactions of these early times, parents would no doubt be careful to instruct their children, by word of mouth, before any of the Scriptures were written; and Moses might derive much information from the same source, as a very few persons formed the chain of tradition, when they lived so many hundred years. <i>Adam</i> would converse with <i>Mathusalem,</i> who knew <i>Sem,</i> as the latter lived in the days of <i>Abram.</i> <i>Isaac, Joseph,</i> and <i>Amram,</i> the father of <i>Moses,</i> were contemporaries: so that seven persons might keep up the memory of things which had happened 2500 years before. But to entitle these accounts to absolute authority, the inspiration of God intervenes; and thus we are convinced, that no word of sacred writers can be questioned. (Haydock)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'GEN:4:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Through God</i>. Hebrew may signify also "even God," as if she thought this was the promised seed, who, as Onkelos paraphrases it, would serve the Lord. (Calmet) --- So little could she foresee the future conduct of Cain, whose name may be derived either from <i>kone, possession</i> and <i>acquisition,</i> or from <i>kun, lamentation.</i> The latter interpretation would have been better verified by the event, and the name of Abel, <i>vanity,</i> or <i>sorrow,</i> for which his parents allege no reason, might also have been reversed, on account of his justice, for which he is canonized by Christ himself, and declared <i>the Just.</i> Pious and significant names were imposed by either parent. Cain was the second man. He was not conceived till after the fall, and was therefore the first born in original sin. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'GEN:4:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Had respect.</i> That is, shewed his acceptance of his sacrifice (as coming from a heart full of devotion): and that we may suppose, by some visible token, such as sending fire from heaven upon his offerings. (Challoner) --- The offerings of Cain are mentioned without any approbation: those of Abel are the <i>firstlings</i> and <i>fat,</i> or the very best; by which he testified, that he acknowledged God for his first beginning. Sacrifice is due to God alone, and to Him it has always been offered in the Church. We have the happiness to offer that truly eucharistic sacrifice to God, of which those of ancient times were only figures. What sacrifice can our erring brethren shew? (Worthington; Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'GEN:4:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Over it.</i> This is a clear proof of free-will. To destroy its force, Protestants translate <i>over him,</i> as if Cain should still retain his privilege of the first-born, notwithstanding all his wickedness, and should rule over Abel, who would willingly submit, "unto thee his desire," &c. But God had made no mention of Abel. The whole discourse is about doing well or ill; and Cain is encouraged to avoid the stings of conscience, by altering his conduct, as it was in his power, how strongly soever his passions might solicit him to evil. (Haydock) --- The Hebrew is understood by Onkelos, and the Targum of Jerusalem, in the sense of the Vulgate. The latter reads, "If thou correct thy proceedings in this life, thou wilt receive pardon in the next world. But if thou do not penance for thy sin, it shall remain till the day of the great judgment, and it shall stay, lying at the door of thy heart. But I have given thee power to govern thy concupiscence: thou shalt sway it, either to embrace good or evil." Calmet shews that the Hebrew perfectly admits of this sense. St. Augustine will not allow of the turn which the Manichees gave it. "Thou shalt have dominion over (<i>illius.</i>) What? thy brother! (<i>absit</i>) by no means: over what then, but sin? (City of God xv. 7.) Protestants formerly abandoned the translation of 1579, (which they have again resumed) and translated better, "unto thee shall be the desire thereof, and thou shalt rule over it," which R. Abenezra explains also of sin. To which of these editions, all given by royal authority, will Protestants adhere? Luther wrote a book against free-will, and Calvin would not admit the very name. But we, with all antiquity, must cry out with St. Jerome, contra Jov. 2: "God made us with free-will, neither are we drawn by necessity to virtue or vice; else where there is necessity, there is neither damnation nor reward." (Worthington; Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - "GEN:4:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Let us go forth abroad.</i> These words are now wanting in the Hebrew; being omitted, according to Kennicott, since the days of Aquila 130; they are found in the Samaritan copy and version, in the Septuagint, &c. (Haydock) --- The Masorets place a mark, as if something were defective here, and in 27 other verses, or in 25 at least. (Haydock) --- Abel's violent death was a figure of that of Jesus Christ, inflicted for the like cause. See Hebrews xii. 2. (Calmet) --- In consequence of these crimes, Cain separated from the Church, and the Jews became no longer God's people: both Cain and the Jews became vagabonds. (Haydock) --- The Targum of Jerusalem observes, that Cain talked against God's providence and the future world, which Abel hearing with marked indignation, Cain took occasion to kill him. (Worthington)"
      v:013:
        - "GEN:4:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>My iniquity,</i> &c. Like Judas, Cain despairs. The Rabbins make him complain of the rigour of God's judgment, \"My sin (or punishment) is too great to be borne.\" I must then be driven from the land of my nativity, from the society of my brethren and parents, from thy presence, for ever. Why do I then live? Let the first man I meet, kill me. (Liranus)"
      v:014:
        - 'GEN:4:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Every one that findeth me, shall kill me.</i> His guilty conscience made him fear his own brothers, and nephews; of whom, by this time, there might be a good number upon the earth: which had now endured near 130 years; as may be gathered from Genesis v. 3, compared with chap. iv. 25, though in the compendious account given in the Scripture, only Cain and Abel are mentioned. (Challoner) --- Cain is little concerned about any thing but the loss of life. (Menochius)'
      v:015:
        - 'GEN:4:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Set a mark,</i> &c. The more common opinion of the interpreters of holy writ, supposes this mark to have been a trembling of the body; or a horror and consternation in his countenance. (Challoner) --- God gave this first murderer a reprieve, allowing him time for repentance; but he neglected it, and died a reprobate; having been, during life, the head of an apostate church, and of the city of the devil, which has ever since opposed the city of God, and the society of the faithful. Though all his posterity were drowned in the deluge, some were soon found, even in the family of Noe, who stood up for the wretched pre-eminence in wickedness and rebellion, against the truth. See St. Augustine; Worthington; &c. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - 'GEN:4:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>A fugitive,</i> according to his sentence. Hebrew <i>nod,</i> which the Septuagint have taken for a proper name. "In the land of Naid, over against Eden," (Haydock) or in the fields of <i>Nyse,</i> in Hyrcania, to the east of Eden and Armenia. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - "GEN:4:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>His wife.</i> She was a daughter of Adam, and Cain's own sister; God dispensing with such marriages in the beginning of the world, as mankind could not otherwise be propagated. --- <i>He built a city,</i> viz. In process of time, when his race was multiplied, so as to be numerous enough to people it. For in the many hundred years he lived, his race might be multiplied even to millions. (Challoner) --- The Hanuchta, which Ptolemy places in Susiana, (Calmet) may perhaps have been built after the flood, in the same place. Josephus says, Cain was the first who fortified a city; designing it for a retreat, where he might keep the fruits of his robberies, Antiquities 1. 3. Peirere founds his ill-concerted system of <i>Preadamites,</i> or of men existing before Adam, on the history of Cain exercising husbandry, building a city, &c.; as if there were any difficulty in supposing, that the arts would have made some progress in the lapse of above a century. (Haydock)"
      v:019:
        - 'GEN:4:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Two wives.</i> Lamech first transgressed the law of having only one wife at a time. (Chap. ii. 24.) None before the deluge is mentioned as having followed his example, even among the abandoned sons of men. Abraham, the father of the faithful, and some others, after that event, when the age of man was shortened, and the number of the true servants of God very small, were dispensed with by God, who tolerated the custom of having many wives at the same time among the Jews, till our Saviour brought things back to the ancient standard. (Matthew xix. 4.) And why do we excuse the patriarchs, while we condemn Lamech? Because the one being associated with the wicked, gives us reason to judge unfavourably of him, while Abraham is constantly mentioned in Scripture with terms of approbation and praise, and therefore we have no right to pass sentence of condemnation upon him, as some Protestants have done, after the Manichees. Hence the fathers defend the one, and reject the other with abhorrence. (Haydock) --- Tertullian (Monog. c. 5.) and St. Jerome, contra Jovin. 1, says, "Lamech, first of all, a bloody murderer, divided one flesh between two wives." It was never lawful, says Pope Innocent III. contra <i>Gaudemus,</i> for any one to have many wives at once, unless leave was given by divine revelation;" and St. Augustine joins with him in defending the patriarchs, by this reason, "When it was the custom, it was not a sin."'
      v:022:
        - 'GEN:4:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Noema,</i> who is supposed to have invented the art of spinning. (Calmet) --- All these worthy people were distinguished for their proficiency in the arts, while they neglected the study of religion and virtue. (Haydock) --- The inventors of arts among the Greeks lived mostly after the siege of Troy. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - 'GEN:4:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Said.</i> This is the most ancient piece of poetry with which we are acquainted. (Fleury) --- Lamech may be considered as the father of poets. (Haydock) --- <i>I have slain a man,</i> &c. It is the tradition of the Hebrews, that Lamech in hunting slew Cain, mistaking him for a wild beast: and that having discovered what he had done, he beat so unmercifully the youth, by whom he was led into that mistake, that he died of the blows. (Challoner) --- St. Jerome, 9. 1. ad Dam. acknowledges the difficulty of this passage, on which Origen wrote two whole books. (Worthington)'
      v:024:
        - 'GEN:4:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Seventy times.</i> A similar expression occurs, Matthew xviii. 22, to denote a great but indefinite number. God had promised to revenge the murder of Cain seven fold, though he had sinned voluntarily; so Lamech hopes that, as he had acted by mistake, and blinded by passion, in striking the stripling, the son of Tubalcain, he would deserve to be protected still more from falling a prey to the fury of any other. But many reject this tradition as fabulous, unknown to Philo, Josephus, &c. Moses no where mentions the death of Cain. Some, therefore, understand this passage with an interrogation; as if, to convince his wives that his sin was not so enormous as was supposed, he should say, Do not think of leaving me. What! have I killed a young man, as Cain did Abel, and still he is suffered to live unmolested; or have I beaten any one so that I should be punished? Onkelos, in effect, puts a negation to the same purport, "I have not killed, &c.:" (Calmet) others understand this passage, as if Lamech considered his crimes as much more grievous than even those of Cain. (Tirinus)'
      v:026:
        - 'GEN:4:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Began to call upon,</i> &c. Not that Adam and Seth had not called upon God before the birth of Enos, but that Enos used more solemnity in the worship and invocation of God. (Challoner) --- He directed all his thoughts towards heaven, being reminded by his own name, which signifies one afflicted, that he could look for no solid happiness on earth. Seth had brought him up, from his infancy, in these pious sentiments, and his children were so docile to his instructions, that they began to be known in the world for their extraordinary piety, and were even styled the <i>Sons of God,</i> chap. vi. 2. (Haydock) --- Religion was not a human invention, but many ceremonies have been adopted, at different times, to make an impression on the minds of the people. Before Enos, the heads of families had officiated in their own houses; now, perhaps, they met together in places consecrated to the divine service, and sounded forth the praises of the Most High. Enos was probably most conspicuous for his zeal on these occasions: at least, a new degree of fervour manifested itself in his days. On the other hand, "the name of the Lord began to be profaned" about this time, as the Rabbin understand this passage, by the introduction of idolatry; which is a common effect of a dissolute life, which many began now to lead, Wisdom xiv. 12. (Calmet) --- <i>The beginning of fornication is the devising of idols.</i> We have, nevertheless, no certain proof of idols being introduced till many years after the deluge. (Haydock)'

        - 'GEN:5:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Adam:</i> the common name of mankind, made to the <em>likeness of God</em>. (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - 'GEN:5:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>He died.</i> Ecclesiasticus xiv. 12, says very justly, <i>the covenant of this world</i> is, he <i>shall surely die.</i> God prolonged the lives of the patriarchs to a more advanced age, that the world might be sooner filled. Their constitution was then more excellent, the fruits of the earth more nourishing, &c. But the sole satisfactory reason for their living almost a thousand years, while we can hardly arrive at 70, is, because so it pleased God, in whose hands are all our lots. There is a great difference in the number of years assigned by the Hebrew and Vulgate, from that which the Samaritan copy mentions; and the Septuagint differs from both. Whether the difference be real, or only apparent, we shall not pretend to determine. The Church has not decided which system of chronology is the most accurate. In the Martyrology, she adopts that of the Septuagint and places the birth of Christ in [the year of the world] 5199, after Eusebius and Ven. Bede, though Riccioli calculates the Septuagint at 5634 years. (Haydock) --- Adam died penitent, as we are assured by the Holy Ghost, Wisdom x. 2.; and tradition affirms the same of Eve, insomuch, that the heresy of the Encratites, who condemned our first parents to hell, was exploded with horror. (St. Epiphanius; St. Augustine, in hæres.; Tirinus)'
      v:024:
        - 'GEN:5:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Walked with God.</i> Septuagint, "was pleasing to God," by continual recollection and watchfulness over himself. Thus he became perfect. --- <i>Was seen no more;</i> or, as St. Paul reads, after the Septuagint, <i>he was not found.</i> (Hebrews xi. 5.) --- <i>God took him</i> alive to some place unknown, which is commonly supposed to be Paradise, conformably to Ecclesiasticus xliv. 16, though in Greek we do not read Paradise. <i>Henoch pleased God, and was translated [into Paradise], that he may give repentance to the nations.</i> To him, that of Wisdom iv. 10, may be applied: <i>He...was beloved, and living among sinners, he was translated.</i> He will come again, when the charity of many of his children (for we all spring from him) shall have grown cold; and shall at last suffer death for opposing Antichrist. (Apocalypse xi.) (Haydock) --- "Though it be not an article of faith, whether Henoch be now in that Paradise, from which Adam and Eve were driven, or in some other delightful place; yet the holy Scriptures affirm, that God translated him alive, that he might not experience death," St. Chrysostom, hom. 21, with whom the other fathers agree, cited in the Douay Bible; so that it is a matter of surprise, how any Protestant can call it in question. He is the other witness, who will come with Elias, before the great day of the Lord, to perform the same office to the nations, as the latter will to the Jews. (Malachias iv.) God preserves these two alive, perhaps to give us a striking proof how he could have treated Adam and his posterity, if they had not sinned; and also to confirm our hopes of immortality, when we shall have paid the debt of nature. (Worthington)'
      v:029:
        - 'GEN:5:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Noe</i> means <i>consolation,</i> or <i>repose.</i> After he had beheld the most dreadful catastrophe or disturbance that ever happened in the world, he settled mankind once more in the friendship of God, and merited a blessing both for himself and for the whole earth. He gave, likewise, comfort to all, by useful inventions in agriculture, and in the art of making wine. He saw an end of the distractions caused by the wicked sons of Cain, and became the restorer of a new world: in a word, he was the progenitor of the Messias [Jesus Christ], who is the King of Peace, and our only solid comfort. (Menochius) (Haydock)'
      v:031:
        - 'GEN:5:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Old.</i> It is wonderful if Noe had no children before this time; but he might have had many, whom the Scripture does not mention, either because they were dead before the deluge, or taking evil courses with the daughters of men, deserved to perish with them. Noe kept the three, who were born after God had foretold the deluge, with the greatest care, under his own eyes. St. Augustine (City of God xv. 20.) thinks, however, that many of the Patriarchs had no children till they were pretty far advanced in years. As Sem was born when Noe was 502, and Cham was the youngest, Japheth must have been the first-born. Compare chap. x. 21, with chap. ix. 24. There is no reason to suppose they were all born the same year. (Calmet)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'GEN:6:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Daughters.</i> These had borne equal proportion with the males from the beginning; but here they are particularized, because they were the chief instruments in corrupting the descendants of Seth. (Haydock) --- Even the sons of these libidinous people were so effeminate, as to deserve to be called women. (Menochius)'
      v:002:
        - 'GEN:6:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>The sons of God.</i> The descendants of Seth and Enos are here called <i>Sons of God,</i> from their religion and piety: whereas the ungodly race of Cain, who by their carnal affections lay grovelling upon the earth, are called the children of men. The unhappy consequence of the former marrying with the latter, ought to be a warning to Christians to be very circumspect in their marriages; and not to suffer themselves to be determined in choice by their carnal passion, to the prejudice of virtue or religion. (Challoner) --- See St. Chrysostom, hom. 22, &c. Some copies of the Septuagint having <i>the angels of God,</i> induced some of the ancients to suppose, that these spiritual beings (to whom, by another mistake, they attributed a sort of aerial bodies) had commerce with women, as the pagans derived their heroes from a mortal and a god. But this notion, which is borrowed from the book of Henoch, is quite exploded. (Calmet) --- The distinction of the true Church from the synagogue of satan, here established, has been ever since retained, as heretics are still distinguished from Catholics. (Worthington) (St. Augustine)'
      v:003:
        - "GEN:6:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>His days shall be,</i> &c. The meaning is, that man's days, which before the flood were usually 900 years, should now be reduced to 120 years. Or rather, that God would allow men this term of 120 years, for their repentance and conversion, before he would send the deluge. (Challoner) --- He spoke therefore to Noe in his 480th year. (St. Augustine) Those who suppose, that he foretold this event 20 years later, think with St. Jerome, that God retrenched 20 years from the time first assigned for penance. The <i>Spirit</i> of the sovereign Judge was fired with <i>contending;</i> or, as others translate it, with remaining quiet as in a <i>scabbard,</i> and bearing with the repeated crimes of men. He resolved to punish them severely in this world, that he might shew mercy to some of them hereafter. (St. Jerome, 9. Heb.) (Calmet) --- If we suppose, that God here threatens to reduce the space of man's life to 120 years, we must say, at least, that he did it by degrees: for many lived several hundred years, even after the deluge. In the days of Moses, indeed, few exceeded that term. But we think the other interpretation is more literal, and that God bore with mankind the full time which he promised. (Worthington)"
      v:004:
        - "GEN:6:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Giants.</i> It is likely the generality of men before the flood were of a gigantic stature, in comparison with what men now are. But these here spoken of, are called <i>giants,</i> as being not only tall in stature, but violent and savage in their dispositions, and mere monsters of cruelty and lust. (Challoner) --- Yet we need not imagine, that they were such as the poets describe, tearing up mountains, and hurling them against heaven. Being offspring of men, who had lived hitherto with great temperance, but now gave full scope to their passions, and the love of the fair daughters whom <i>they chose,</i> we need not wonder that they should be amazingly strong and violent. <i>Nephilim, rushing on,</i> as Ag.[Aquila?] translates. That there have been giants of an unusual size, all historians testify. Og, Goliah, &c. are mentioned in Scripture, and the sons of Enac are represented as much above the common size, as the Hebrews were greater than grasshoppers, Numbers xiii. 34. If we should suppose they were four or five times our size, would that be more wonderful than that they should live nine or ten times as long as we do? See St. Augustine, City of God xv. 9, 23; Calmet's Dissert. &c. Delrio affirms, that in 1572 he saw at Rouen, a native of Piedmont, above nine feet high. (Haydock) --- <i>Of old.</i> The corruption of morals had commenced many ages ago, and some of the sons of Seth had given way to their lusts; so that we are not to suppose, that these giants were all born within a hundred years of the flood, as some might suppose from their being mentioned here, after specifying the age of Noe, chap. v. 31. (Haydock)"
      v:005:
        - 'GEN:6:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>At all times.</i> Hebrew: only evil continually. They had no relish for any thing else: as we may say of a glutton, he thinks of nothing but his belly. Yet some good thoughts would occur occasionally, and we may grant that they did some things which were not sinful. (Menochius) --- If we follow corrupt nature, and live among sinners, we find a law within us warring against the spirit; and a very powerful grace is necessary to rescue us from such a dangerous situation. (Calmet) --- Though the expressions in this place seem general, they must be understood with some limitations. (Worthington)'
      v:006:
        - 'GEN:6:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>It repented him,</i> &c. God, who is unchangeable, is not capable of repentance, grief, or any other passion. But these expressions are used to declare the enormity of the sins of men, which was so provoking as to determine their Creator to destroy these his creatures, whom before he had so much favoured. (Challoner) --- God acted outwardly as a man would do who repented. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'GEN:6:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Grace.</i> Notwithstanding the general denunciation against all flesh, we see here that God will not confound the just with the guilty, in the same punishment. Noe pleased God, by observing the most perfect justice, in the midst of a corrupt generation. (St. Chrysostom; &c.) (Worthington)'
      v:012:
        - 'GEN:6:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Its way,</i> being abandoned to the most shameful and unnatural sins. (Liranus)'
      v:013:
        - "GEN:6:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>All flesh.</i> I will destroy all these carnal and wicked people, and, because all other creatures were made only for man's use, and will be useless, I will involve them in the common ruin, reserving only what will be necessary for the support of the few, who shall be preserved, and for the repeopling of the earth. (Haydock)"
      v:014:
        - 'GEN:6:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Timber planks.</i> Hebrew, "gopher wood," which is no where else mentioned in Scripture. It was probably a sort of wood full of rosin, and being besmeared with something like our pitch, was capable of resisting the fury of the ensuing tremendous storm, for a length of time. (Calmet; Haydock) --- <i>Rooms</i> to separate the birds, various animals, provisions, &c. --- <i>Pitch,</i> literally: "besmear it with bitumen," which has a very strong smell, able to counteract the disagreeable odours arising from beasts confined. (Menochius) --- It might be mixed with some other ingredients, naphtha, pitch, &c. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - "GEN:6:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Three hundred cubits,</i> &c. The ark, according to the dimensions here set down, contained four hundred and fifty thousand square cubits; which were more than enough to contain all the kinds of living creatures, with all necessary provisions: even supposing the cubits here spoken of to have been only a foot and a half each, which was the least kind of cubits. (Challoner) --- It is therefore unnecessary for us to have recourse, with Cappel, to the sacred cubit, which was twice as large as the common one, but which seems not to have been in use among the Jews before the Babylonian captivity. Still less need we adopt the geometrical cubit, which contains six ordinary ones, as we might be authorised to do by the great names of Origen and St. Augustine, City of God xv. 27. q. in Gen. i. 4. These dimensions would make the ark as large as a city. Moses always speaks of the same sort of cubit, used probably in Egypt. Apelles and other heretics, with some modern infidels, have attempted to shew, that this account of Moses is fabulous. But they have been amply refuted by able calculators, John Buteo, Pelletier, &c. This amazing structure, for which God himself gave the plan, was divided with three stories, besides the lower part of the vessel, which might serve to keep fresh water. The different species of animals are not so numerous, as some imagine. Fishes, and such creatures as can live in water, would not need to come into the ark. Animals deprived of exercise, and allowed barely what may support nature, will live upon a very little. Even an ox, according to Columella, will live on 30 pounds of hay, or on a cubic foot, a whole day, so that 400 of these large creatures might be supported on 146,000 cubic feet. The middle story, for provisions, would alone contain 150,000 cubits. Noe's family, and the birds, would probably occupy the room above, in which was a window all around, of the height of a <i>cubit,</i> without glass or crystal, which were not yet invented, but defended with lattice work of wood, like our dairy rooms. (Haydock)"
      v:016:
        - 'GEN:6:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>In a cubit.</i> This is understood by some, of the height of the window; by others, of the roof, which would be almost flat, like the top of a coach. Menoch supposes, that the whole ark was to be measured with the cubit in every part, from the bottom <i>to the top;</i> and the words <i>of it,</i> properly refer to the ark. --- <i>Side,</i> or at the end, about the middle way, that the animals might be conveyed easily to their stalls. The door would open into the story allotted to the beasts, and all things might enter it by a sort of bridge, or by sloping planks. (Calmet) --- Ordure might be thrown down into the lowest part of the ark, separated from the reservoir of fresh water, or might be brought up with ropes and buckets to the window at the top, which would easily open. (Tirinus)'
      v:018:
        - 'GEN:6:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>My covenant,</i> that thou shalt be saved, amid the general ruin. This is the second covenant of God with man: the first was with Adam, the third with Abraham, when circumcision was instituted, and the last with Moses, Exodus xix. All others were only ratifications of these; and even these were only figures of that which our Saviour entered into with men, when he undertook to make satisfaction for them to his Father. (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - 'GEN:6:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Two,</i> intended for the propagation of their kind. God afterwards specifies what more Noe should preserve for food, chap. vii. 2. (Calmet). --- Wild beasts forgot their savage nature, and became subject to the just Noe; and all came readily at his beck, in the same manner as domestic animals come when we offer them food. Yet, in all this we must acknowledge the work of God, and a sort of miracle. (Haydock)'

    commentary:
      v:002:
        - 'GEN:7:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Of all clean.</i> The distinction of clean and unclean beasts, appears to have been made before the law of Moses, which was not promulgated till the year of the world 2514. (Challoner). --- <i>Clean:</i> not according to the law of Moses, which was not yet given, but such as tradition had described --- fit for sacrifice; (Menochius) though they might be of the same species as were deemed clean in the law, which ratified the ancient institution. --- <i>And seven:</i> (Hebrew) simply <i>seven,</i> three couple and an odd male, for sacrifice after the deluge: one couple was to breed, the other two perhaps for food. (Haydock) --- Some imagine, that there were fourteen unclean and four clean animals, of every species, in the ark, because the Samaritan, Septuagint, and Vulgate read, "seven and seven." (Origen, &c.) --- But our Saviour, sending the Disciples to preach <i>two and two,</i> did not appoint a company of four to go together, but only of two, as is generally allowed, Mark vi. 7. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'GEN:7:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Seventeenth day.</i> On the tenth, God had given the last warning to the wretched and obstinate sinners, to whom Noe had been preaching, both by word and by building the ark, for 120 years; all in vain. This <i>second month</i> is, by some, supposed to be the month of May; by others, that of November. Usher makes Noe enter the ark on the 18th December [in the year of the world] 1656. The waters decreased May 17, mountains appear July 31, he sends out the raven September 8, and leaves the ark December 29, after having remained in it a year and ten days, according to the antediluvian computation, or a full year of 365 days. The systems of those pretended philosophers, who would represent this flood as only partial, affecting the countries which were then inhabited, are all refuted by the plain narration of Moses. What part of the world could have been secure, when the waters prevailed fifteen cubits above the highest mountains? To give a natural cause only for this miraculous effect, would be nugatory: but as waters covered the earth at first, so they surely might again, by the power of God. (Haydock) --- <i>Fountains and flood-gates.</i> These are the two natural causes which Moses assigns for the deluge, the waters below, and those above in the sky or firmament. Heaven is said to be shut when it does not rain, (Luke iv. 25.) so it is here <i>opened,</i> and flood-gates, or torrents of rain, pour down incessantly. But God attributes not the deluge to these causes alone; he sufficiently intimates that it would be miraculous, (ver. 4, <i>I will rain,</i>) and still more emphatically, chap. vi. 17, <i>Behold I</i>. Hebrew, "I, even I myself, do bring on a flood of waters." The idea which Moses give of the flood, corresponds with that which he before gave of chaos, when earth and water were undistinguished in one confused mass, chap. i. 6. The Hebrews look upon it as a continual miracle, that the earth is not always deluged, being founded, as they represent it, on the waters, Jeremias v. 22. Calmet and others have proved, both from Scripture and from philosophical arguments, the universality of the deluge, against Isaac Vossius, &c. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - 'GEN:7:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>The Lord shut him in,</i> by an angel besmearing the door with pitch, to prevent the waters from penetrating, while Noe did the like in the inside. (Calmet) --- Thus God supplies our wants when we are not able to provide for ourselves, and though he could do all by himself, yet he requires us to co-operate with him, and often makes use of secondary causes. (Worthington)'
      v:024:
        - "GEN:7:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Days:</i> counting from the end of the forty days, when the deluge was at its height. (Calmet) --- In all the histories of past ages, there is nothing so terrible as this event. What became of all those myriads of human beings who perished on this occasion? We know not. Some have charitably supposed, that, although the far greater part perished everlastingly, a few <i>who had been incredulous</i> while Noe preached, opened their eyes at last, when it was too late to save their bodies, and by sincere repentance rescued their souls from the flames, and were consigned to do penance, for a time, in the other world. These heard the preaching of Jesus Christ, or believed in his redemption, while they were yet living, and so deserved to partake of his mercies, and joyfully beheld his sacred person when he came to visit them in their <i>prison</i> of purgatory. 1 Peter iii. 19, <i>He came and preached to those spirits that were in prison: which had been sometime incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is eight souls, were saved</i> from drowning <i>by water. Whereunto baptism, being of the like form, now saves you also,</i> &c. See F. S. Bellarmine, &c. In these last words of St. Peter, we may also notice, that the ark was a figure of baptism, which is so necessary, that without its reception, or desire of it at least, no man can be saved. It is also a figure of the cross, and of the one true Church, as the Fathers remark, with St. Augustine, City of God xv. i; Menochius &c.; St. Gregory, hom. 12 in Ezech. &c. --- This is so striking that it deserves to be seriously considered. It was only <i>one,</i> though God could have ordered many smaller vessels to be made ready, perhaps with less inconvenience to Noe, that we might reflect, out of the Church the obstinate will surely perish. St. Jerome, ep. ad Dam.: In this ark <i>all</i> that were truly <i>holy,</i> and some imperfect, like Cham, were contained, clean beasts and unclean dwelt together, that we need not wonder if some Catholics be a disgrace to their name. The ark had different partitions, to remind us of the various <i>orders</i> of Clergy and Laity in the Church, with one chief governor, the Pope, like Noe in the ark. It was strong, visible, &c., and pitched all over with the durable cement, <i>bitumen,</i> and riding triumphant amid the storms, the envy of all who were out of it, till at last it settled upon a <i>rock.</i> So the Church is built on a rock, against which the gates of hell shall not prevail: she is not less obvious to the sincere seeker, than a city built on the top of the highest mountain, &c. We might here take a retrospective view of the chief occurrences and personages of the former world; we should observe the same order of the things from the beginning, --- the conflict of virtue and vice, the preservation of the true faith and worship of God among a few chosen souls, who preferred to be persecuted by worldlings, rather than to offend God. <i>They contended earnestly for the faith once delivered to the Saints,</i> to Adam and Eve, once innocent, and afterwards penitent. We behold original sin, and the promised remedy for mankind; while the rebel angels are abandoned, without redress. There was kept up a communion of saints: sacrifice to the one God was performed generally by the heads of families, who were priests in the law of nature. Even Cain, though a bad man, through hypocrisy, chose to offer sacrifice before he had quite broken off from the society of the faithful, and resolved to become the father of all excommunicated persons, and of all seceders. (Chap. iv. 16.) He was admonished by God that he had free will, and might merit a reward by a different conduct. His sentence, as well as that pronounced upon Adam, and upon all mankind, before the flood, reminds us of the particular and general judgment; as the translation of Henoch sets before us the happy state of the blessed, and the immortality, of which it was an earnest. See Douay Bible, where the chief mysteries of faith are pointed out as the creed of the Antediluvians. Even the Blessed Trinity was insinuated, or shewn to them, at a distance, in various texts: the unity and indissolubility of marriage were clearly expressed; the true Church continued in Noe, while the chain of schismatics and heretics was broken, and Cain's progeny destroyed. In this period of time, we may discover what the ancients so often describe respecting the four ages: --- the <i>golden</i> age is most perfectly found in Paradise; but only for a few days, or perhaps only a few hours, during which our first parents preserved their innocence. The <i>silver</i> age may have lasted rather longer, till the murder of Abel, or 128 years, when Cain began to disturb the peace of the world. From that time, till the giants make their appearance, we may reckon the age of <i>brass.</i> But that of <i>iron</i> had continued for many years before the flood. The like deterioration of morals we may discover after the deluge, and again after the renovation of the world, by the preaching of the gospel. For some time after these two great events, things bore a pleasing aspect; Noe was busy in offering sacrifice to God, Christians were all one heart and one soul, enjoying all things in common, and God gave a blessing to the earth, and confirmed his covenant with men. Then Cham, Nemrod, and Babel appear, heresies in the new law break forth, and disturb the lovely harmony of mankind: but still a sufficient number preserve their integrity, till about the days of Abraham and Arius, in their respective periods, and may be said to have lived in the <i>silver</i> age, when compared with the <i>brazen</i> insolence of the great majority of those who came after. The <i>iron</i> age of these two periods, may be dated from the persecution of Epiphanes against the Jews, when so many apostatized from the faith, and from that much more terrible persecution which will be raised against Christians by Antichrist, the man of sin, (of which the former was a type) when the charity of many shall grow cold, and Christ will hardly find faith upon the earth. To that age may justly be applied, those strong expressions of disapprobation which God made use of before the flood, chap. vi. 3, 6, 12. He will punish the crimes of that age with a deluge of <i>fire,</i> and say, <i>The end of all flesh is come before me,</i> &c., ver. 13. <i>Time shall be no longer,</i> Apocalypse x. 6. (Haydock)"

      v:001:
        - 'GEN:8:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Remembered;</i> not as if God had ever forgotten Noe, but he now shews his remembrance of him by the effects. (Menochius) --- <i>A wind,</i> literally <i>a spirit,</i> which St. Ambrose and Theodoret understood of the Holy Ghost, that as he moved over the waters at first, (Chap. i. 2.) to give them fecundity, and to exercise his power in establishing order, so he may shew the same care and providence for this new world, emerging, like the former, from the waters. (Haydock) --- Most interpreters, however, understand this of a violent wind; (Proverbs xxv. 23; Exodus xiv. 21.) a strong blast, such as was sent to divide the Red sea. (Menochius)'
      v:003:
        - 'GEN:8:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>And the waters returned,</i> &c. St. Jerome on this passage remarks, "that all waters and torrents repair to the womb of the abyss, through the hidden veins of the earth," and by the abyss understands the sea: according to that of Ecclesiastes i. 7, <i>all the rivers run into the sea.</i> But as the sea itself, on this occasion, exceeded its limits, (otherwise its waters would not have been higher than the land) the sense perhaps confined to this, that the waters by degrees were diminished; as we may say of the inundations of land, that the waters are gone off, not by the regular course of ditches, but from the effects of the sun and winds which dry them up. (Estius)'
      v:004:
        - 'GEN:8:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>And the ark rested on the mountains of Armenia.</i> The Hebrew word is <i>Ararat,</i> which also occurs in the 37th chap. of Isaias, and the 51st of Jeremias; for in these places our interpreter retained the Hebrew word, but in the 4th book of Kings, xix. 37, where the same history is related, it is translated <i>by the land of the Armenians.</i> (Estius) --- <i>Seventh month,</i> of the year, not of the deluge, as appears from ver. 13, &c. (Menochius). --- <i>Seven and twentieth.</i> So also the Septuagint, but the Hebrew, &c. have the 17th. It is not easy to decide which is right. On the seventeenth the waters only began to decrease, and some hence argue for the Vulgate, as they say it is not probable the ark would stop that very day. (Calmet) --- This, however, might be the only mean by which Noe could discern that the waters were abating. (Haydock) --- The ark being about fourteen cubits sunk in the water, might soon touch the summit of the highest mountains, such as Mount Taurus, of which the <i>Ararat,</i> here mentioned in the Hebrew, a mountain of <i>Armenia,</i> forms a part, according to St. Jerome. The Armenians still boast that they have the remains of the ark. Berosus, the Pagan historian, says bitumen was taken from it as a preservative. (Josephus, Antiquities i. 3; Eusebius, præp. ix. 4.) The Chaldee has Cordu for Ararat, whence some have supposed, that the ark rested on the Cordyean or Gordiean mountains. The Armenians call the mountain near Erivan, <i>Mesesonsar,</i> or the mountain of the ark. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'GEN:8:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Did not return.</i> The negotiation <i>Not,</i> is not to be found in any Hebrew copy now extant; though it is still retained by the Septuagint, and several Latin manuscripts, according to the testimony of Liranus. If we adhere, therefore, to the Hebrew text, we must translate it with St. Jerome, thus; <i>It went forth, going and returning,</i> (<i>Egredicbatur exiens et revertens</i>) sometimes repairing to the mountains, where it found carcasses to feed on, and at other times returning not <i>unto</i> the ark, but to rest upon the <i>top</i> of it. (Estius) (Challoner) --- Or receded farther from it; as the Hebrew may be explained, agreeably to the Vulgate, Septuagint, Syriac, &c. which admit the negation. (Calmet) --- <i>Till,</i> as long as the waters covered the earth, not that it returned to the ark afterwards. (Menochius)'

(Pliny, Natural History xii. 25.) --- Many other trees and seeds will live for a long time under the waters. (Calmet) --- This tender branch of the olive seems to agree better with the spring than autumn; whence Tirinus infers, that the deluge began and ended in spring.'
      v:013:
        - "GEN:8:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Year</i> of Noe's age, who, we may suppose, was born on the first day of the year. So that his 601st year corresponds with the 1657th of the world, B.C. 2343, on which day the deluge ended. Still Noe waited for God's order to leave the ark till the 27th of the ensuing month, when the earth was more perfectly dried. (Haydock) --- <i>Covering.</i> Some think that the window was at the top, like a sky-light. (Calmet)"
      v:017:
        - "GEN:8:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Increase.</i> Hebrew, \"let them increase.\" This is spoken of the brute creation, the blessing is given to men. (Chap. ix.) --- Neither Noe's family, nor any of the animals, had any young in the ark. (Calmet)"
      v:020:
        - "GEN:8:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Holocausts,</i> or whole burnt offerings. In which the whole victim was consumed by fire upon God's altar, and no part was reserved for the use of priest or people. (Challoner) --- This is the first time we read of an altar, though Abel had surely made use of one. (Menochius) --- Noe delays not to shew his gratitude to God, St. Ambrose. (Worthington)"
      v:021:
        - "GEN:8:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Smelled,</i> &c. A figurative expression, denoting that God was pleased with the sacrifices which his servant offered, (Challoner) and in this sense it is expressed in the Chaldee, \"God received his offering gratefully.\" God requires sacrifices of us, to testify his dominion, and not for any advantage he derives from them; but rather to bless us, if we perform our duty with fervour. --- <em>For the sake</em> of, or on account of men's sins. They are so prone to evil, that, if I were to punish them as often as they deserve, new deluges might be sent every day. I take pity on their weakness. I will punish the most criminal, but not as I have done, by cursing the earth. These words of God, are by some addressed to Noe, by others to God the Son. Hebrew, \"he said to his heart;\" Onkelos, \"he said in his word;\" Septuagint, \"he said with reflection.\" (Calmet) --- Noe was beloved by God, and therefore may be called his heart. To speak to the heart, often means to comfort. (Haydock)"
      v:022:
        - 'GEN:8:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Seed-time,</i> according to the Targum of Jonathan, is the equinox of September; <i>harvest,</i> that of March; winter and summer denote the solstice of December and of June. But the Hebrews probably divided the year into summer and winter; or perhaps they might also admit the season of spring, with the Egyptians and the ancient Greeks, who represented the seasons by the three hours, daughters of Jupiter.

(Challoner) --- <i>Wine,</i> Though vines had grown from the beginning, the art of making wine seems not to have been discovered; and hence Noe's fault is much extenuated, and was at most only a venial sin. (Menochius) --- His nakedness prefigured the desolate condition of Christ upon the cross, which was a scandal to the Jews, and foolishness to the Gentiles. But by this folly we are made wise; we are redeemed, and enjoy the name of Christians. Sem and Japheth represent the multitude of believers, Cham and Chanaan the audacity and impudence of all unbelievers. (St. Augustine, contra Faust. xii. 24; City of God xvi. 2; St. Cyprian, ep. 63.[62.?] ad Cæcil.) (Worthington) --- Like the Manichees, modern heretics are very free in condemning many innocent actions of the Patriarchs. (Haydock)"

        - "GEN:9:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Cursed be Chanaan.</i> The <i>curses,</i> as well as the <i>blessings,</i> of the patriarchs were <i>prophetical:</i> and this in particular is here recorded by Moses, for the children of Israel, who were to possess the land of Chanaan. But why should Chanaan be cursed for his father's fault? The Hebrews answer, that he being then a boy was the first that saw his grandfather's nakedness, and told his father Cham of it; and joined with him in laughing at it: which drew upon him, rather than upon the rest of the children of Cham, this prophetical curse. (Challoner) --- Theodoret, q. 57. The children of Sem executed this sentence, in exterminating many of the Chanaanites under Josue. (Worthington) --- They perished for their own wickedness, which God foresaw, and revealed to Noe. Cham was severely punished by this denunciation of his children's misery. See Milton, xi. 754. xii. 27; Deuteronomy ix. 4. (Haydock)"

(Worthington) --- May <i>he,</i> God, according to some; but more probably Japheth, of whom the rest of the sentence speaks. (Haydock) --- This was verified by the extensive dominion of the children of Japheth, both in the islands and on the continent; more particularly, when the Romans subdued the Jews, and posterity of Sem. (Menochius) --- Referring all this to the Church, the Gentiles entered in, upon the refusal of the Jews, though preachers of that nation were the instruments of their conversion. Chanaan, in the mean time, cherished his slavery, and seeks not to obtain the liberty and glory of the sons of God, in which he is a figure of heretics, (Haydock) who serve to make Christians more upon their guard, and by persecuting them, exercise their patience and increase their crown. (Worthington)'
      v:029:
        - "GEN:9:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>He died,</i> having witnessed the attempt of his children to build the tower of Babel, (we may suppose with disapprobation) and having been concerned in the dispersion of nations. Some imagine he travelled eastward, and founded the empire of China, which is denied by others. (Haydock) --- The fathers conclude that he had no children after the deluge, as the Scripture mentions the world was divided among his three sons and their offspring. Perhaps the fabulous account of Saturn is a perversion of Noe's history, as the three great pagan deities, Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto, to whom Saturn gave the empire of heaven, seas and hell, may have been intended for the three sons of Noe. The Egyptians have attributed to their Osiris the erecting of altars, cultivating vines, teaching agriculture, &c. for which we have seen Noe was so famous. (Calmet) --- This great and virtuous patriarch had only been dead two years, when the faithful Abraham was born, as it were to succeed him in maintaining the cause of God. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins assert, that God gave some general laws to Noe, which were necessarily to be observed by all who would obtain salvation: 1. To obey the laws; 2. Not to curse God; 3. Nor admit of any false god, nor of any superstition; 4. Not to marry one's mother, mother-in-law, sister by the same mother, or another person's wife, nor to commit sins against nature; 5. Not to shed blood, that of beasts must be buried; 6. Not to steal, or break one's word; 7. Not to eat the limb of a living creature. Maimonides thinks this last was given to Noe, the rest to Adam.

(Du Hamel) --- Sem comes last, though elder than Cham, that the history of the true Church may be more connected. Though it would be a work of great labour to discover what nations sprung from the people here mentioned, yet some are sufficiently obvious; and the learned Bochart has given very plausible applications of the different names to the respective nations, in his <i>Phaleg.</i> or sacred Geography. <i>Gomer</i> is supposed to be the father of the Cimbri in Germany, from whom the French and English also probably sprung. (Haydock) --- <i>Magog,</i> father of the Scythians, &c. (Ezechiel 36.[Ezechiel xxxviii.?]) <i>Madai</i> of the Medes, <i>Javan</i> of the Ionians in Greece, <i>Thubal</i> of the Iberians and Spaniards, <i>Mosoch</i> of the Muscovites, <i>Thiras</i> of the Thracians.'

And such he was, not only in the opinion of men, but <i>before the Lord;</i> that is, in his sight who cannot be deceived. (Challoner) --- The Septuagint call him <i>a giant;</i> that is, a <i>violent</i> man. According to Josephus, he stirred up men to rebel against the Lord, maintaining that all their happiness must come from themselves, &c., Antiquities i. 4. Thus he broached the first heresy after the deluge. (Worthington) --- He seems to have been the same as Bel, father of Ninus, and the author of idolatry. (Menochius)'

See 2 Kings vi. 10. (Bochart.) There he built Ninive, on the Tigris. But the exact situation of this vast city is not even known.

By mentioning him alone, we may gather that Sem was elder than Cham, who is called the less or younger son. (Haydock) --- The Hebrew may be translated either way.

The copies of the Septuagint still extant, all assert that Cainan was the son of Arphaxad, in all the places where they are mentioned, both in Genesis and Chronicles; and though some endeavour to prove that this is an interpolation, inserted by a later hand, it is certain it was found in the Septuagint in the days of St. Luke, who confirms it by his authority, as all the copies both Greek and Latin, except a very faulty one which belonged to Beza, and is now at Cambridge, testify. Beza was so bold as to expunge the name. But before we allow of this freedom, we must be informed how St. Luke could adopt such an error, being, as he was, under the guidance of the Holy Ghost! See Salien, &c. (Haydock) --- Mariana asserts, that the Hebrew copies have been vitiated.'

This language has been preserved ever since, though with some alterations. Most of the oriental languages are but like dialects from it, as French, Italian, &c. are from Latin. The arguments which are brought to prove that other languages are more ancient, because the names of men, &c. have a proper significance in them as well as in Hebrew, do not invalidate the right of the latter. The most respectable authors have, therefore, always declared for it. (Haydock)'

As men seemed bent on taking heaven by storm, like the ancient giants, God turns their expressions, as it were, against themselves, and shews them an example of humility, <i>let us go down.</i> He acts the part of a judge, and therefore will examine all with the utmost diligence, as he denotes by these expressions; being really incapable of moving from place to place, on account of his immensity. (Haydock) --- He seems nearer to men, by the effects or punishments which he inflicted. The address which he here makes is directed, not to the angels, but to the other co-equal powers of the Blessed Trinity. (Menochius)'

        - 'GEN:11:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Babel,</i> that is, <i>confusion.</i> This is one of the greatest miracles recorded in the Old Testament; men forgot, in a moment, the language which they had hitherto spoken, and found themselves enabled to speak another, known only to a few of the same family (Calmet); for we must not suppose, that there were as many new languages as there were men at Babel. (Menochius) --- The precise number of languages which were then heard, cannot be determined. The learned commonly acknowledge the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Teutonic, Sclavonian, Tartarian, and Chinese languages, to be original. The rest are only dialects from these. English is chiefly taken from the Teutonic, (Calmet) with many words borrowed from the Greek and other languages. (Haydock)'

He is placed first, on account of his superior dignity in the church of God, in like manner as Sem, Moses, &c. In his youth, he is supposed to have followed the idolatrous worship of his fathers. (St. Augustine, City of God x. chap. ult.[last chap.]; Genebrard, A.M. 1949[the year of the world 1949].) (Calmet) --- But being soon enlightened by God, he becomes a glorious witness of the truth, and, according to many, is preserved miraculously, when thrown into the fire <i>by the Chaldees,</i> ver. 31. (Haydock)'
      v:029:
        - "GEN:11:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Jescha,</i> whom many confound with Sarai, as if both Nacher and Abram had married the daughters of their brother Aran. But why then does Moses mention Sarai before, and then call her Jescha in the same verse? It seems as if he intended to designate two different women. (Haydock) --- In effect, Abram himself says, Sarai was truly his <i>sister, born of the same father,</i> chap. xii. 13. See chap. xx. 12, where we shall give the reasons that seem to prove that she was the daughter of Thare, and not Aran. (Calmet) --- Jescha does not accompany her grandfather, preferring, perhaps, to stay with Nachor, or to marry in her own country; if she were not already dead when Thare departed from <i>Ur,</i> a city <i>of the Chaldees.</i> (Haydock) --- This city is probably Ura, in Mesopotamia, not far from Nisibis, which the Scripture often mentions as a part of Chaldea. (Acts vii. 2, &c.) (Calmet) --- It is not, however, certain that the rest of Thare's family remained behind; if they did, they removed soon after into the country about Haran, or Charræ, on the Chaboras. (Chap. xxix. 4; Josephus, Antiquities 1. 6.) (Haydock)"

(Haydock) --- St. Stephen clearly distinguishes these two calls of Abram. From the second, the 430 years of sojournment, mentioned Galatians iii; Exodus xii, must be dated. (Calmet) --- This is the third grand epoch of the world, about [the year of the world] 2083, when God chooses one family to maintain the one faith, which he had all along supported. See Worthington &c."

Many of the foregoing promises regarded a future world, and Abram was by no means incredulous, when he found himself afflicted here below, as if God had forgot his promises. (Calmet) --- He was truly blessed, in knowing how to live poor in spirit, even amid riches and honours; faithful in all tribulations and trials; <i>following God</i> in all things, ver. 1.'

The mentioning of these idolatrous nations here, gives us reason to admire the faith and constancy of Abram, who neither doubted of the fulfilling of this promise, nor hesitated to adore the true God publicly, ver. 7. Hence there is no reason for accounting this an interpolation. (Haydock)'

Abram acts with prudence, and does not tempt God: if he had made known that the woman was his wife, he would have exposed his life to imminent danger, amid a cruel and lascivious people; and being convinced of the chastity of Sarai, he did not, in the least, apprehend that she would consent to any violation of her conjugal engagements. He did not, therefore, expose her virtue as the Manichees pretended. (St. Augustine, contra Faust. xxii. 33; City of God xvi. 19.) (Haydock; Calmet) --- The event proved the justice of Abram's suspicions, and God's interference shewed that he was not displeased with his concealing part of the truth. Who can be so simple as to suppose, that we are bound to explain all our concerns to a foe? Do not we every day act with the like caution as Abram did, when we have reason to fear danger?

      v:001: 'GEN:13:1 | 1 | 1 | And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him into the south.'
      v:002: GEN:13:2 | 2 | 2 | And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver.
      v:003: 'GEN:13:3 | 3 | 3 | And he returned by the way, that he came, from the south to Bethel, to the place where before he had pitched his tent between Bethel and Hai,'

      v:005: 'GEN:13:5 | 5 | 5 | But Lot also, who was with Abram, had flocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.'
      v:006: 'GEN:13:6 | 6 | 6 | Neither was the land able to bear them, that they might dwell together:{VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0} for their substance was great, and they could not dwell together.'
      v:007: GEN:13:7 | 7 | 7 | Whereupon also there arose a strife between the herdsmen of Abram and of Lot. And at that time the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelled in that country.
      v:008: 'GEN:13:8 | 8 | 8 | Abram therefore said to Lot: Let there be no quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen: for we are brethren.'
      v:009: 'GEN:13:9 | 9 | 9 | Behold the whole land is before thee: depart from me, I pray thee: if thou wilt go to the left hand, I will take the right: if thou choose the right hand, I will pass to the left.'
      v:010: 'GEN:13:10 | 10 | 10 | And Lot lifting up his eyes, saw all the country about the Jordan, which was watered throughout, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, and like Egypt as one comes to Segor.'
      v:011: 'GEN:13:11 | 11 | 11 | And Lot chose to himself the country about the Jordan, and he departed from the east: and they were separated one brother from the other.'
      v:012: 'GEN:13:12 | 12 | 12 | Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan: and Lot abode in the towns, that were about the Jordan, and dwelt in Sodom.'
      v:013: 'GEN:13:13 | 13 | 13 | And the men of Sodom were very wicked, and sinners before the face of the Lord beyond measure.'
      v:014: 'GEN:13:14 | 14 | 14 | And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Lift up thy eyes, and look from the place wherein thou now art, to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west.'

(Calmet) --- These also were auxiliaries of the five kings, and hence experienced the fury of the four confederates; who cut off all their opponents, before they made their grand attack upon Sodom. (Haydock)'

        - 'GEN:14:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Misphat,</i> or of judgment and contradiction, because there the Hebrews contended with Moses and Aaron: it was afterwards called Cadez, Numbers xx. 11. --- <i>Amalecites,</i> that is which they afterwards possessed; for as yet Amelec was unborn, chap. xxxvi. 16.

      v:010:
        - 'GEN:14:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Of slime.</i> <i>Bituminis.</i> This was a kind of pitch, which served for mortar in the building of Babel, Genesis xi. 3, and was used by Noe in pitching the ark. (Challoner) --- Moses does not make this remark without reason. This bitumen would easily take fire, and contribute to the conflagration of Sodom. (Calmet) --- <i>Overthrown,</i> not all slain, for the king of Sodom escaped ver. 17.'

      v:014:
        - 'GEN:14:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Servants,</i> fit for war. Hence we may form some judgment of the power and dignity of Abram, who was considered as a great prince in that country, chap. xxiii. 6. He was assisted by Mambre, Escol, and Aner, with all the forces they could raise on such a short warning; and coming upon the four kings unawares, in four divisions, easily discomfits them, while they were busy plundering the cities, and pursues them <i>to Dan;</i> which is either the city that went by that name afterwards, or more probably one of the sources of the Jordan, (Haydock) which the people of the country call <i>Medan.</i> Neither did he suffer them to repose, before he had retaken all the plunder at <i>Hoba,</i> or Abila, north of the road leading to Damascus. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - "GEN:14:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Melchisedech</i> was not Sem: for his genealogy is given in Scripture. (Hebrews vii. 6.); nor God the Son, for they are compared together; nor the Holy Ghost, as some have asserted, but a virtuous Gentile who adored the true God, and was <i>king of Salem,</i> or Jerusalem, and <i>Priest</i> of an order different from that of Aaron, offering in sacrifice <i>bread and wine,</i> a figure of Christ's sacrifice in the Mass; as the fathers constantly affirm. (Haydock) --- See Pererius. St. Jerome, ep. ad Evagrium, says, \"Melchisedech offered not bloody victims, but dedicated the sacrament of Christ in bread and wine...a pure sacrifice.\" See St. Cyprian ep. 63[62?], ad Cæcil.; St. Augustine, City of God xvi. 22, &c. Many Protestants confess, that this renowned prince of Chanaan, was also a priest; but they will not allow that his sacrifices consisted of bread and wine. In what then? for a true priest must offer some real sacrifice. If <i>Christ,</i> therefore, be <i>a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech,</i> whose sacrifice was not bloody, as those of Aaron were, what other sacrifice does he now offer, but that of his own body and blood in the holy Mass, by the ministry of his priests? <i>for he was the priest:</i> this is plainly referred to <i>bringing forth,</i> &c., which shews that word to be sacrificial, as in Judges vi. 18. The Hebrew may be ambiguous. But all know that <i>vau</i> means <i>for</i> as well as <i>and</i>. Thus the English Bible had it, 1552, \"for he was the priest.\" (Worthington) --- If Josephus take notice only of Melchisedech, offering Abram and his men corporal refreshment, we need not wonder; he was a Jewish priest, to whom the order of Melchisedech might not be agreeable. It is not indeed improbable, but Abram might partake of the meat, which had been offered in thanksgiving by Melchisedech; and in this sense his words are true. But there would be no need of observing, that he was a priest on this account; as this was a piece of civility expected from princes on similar occasions. (Deuteronomy xxiii. 4; 2 Kings xvii. 27.) (Haydock)"
      v:019:
        - "GEN:14:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Blessed him,</i> as his inferior, and received tithes of him, Hebrews iv. 7.[vii. 4.?] This shews the antiquity of the practice of supporting God's priests by tithes."

      v:022:
        - 'GEN:14:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>I lift up.</i> This is the posture of one swearing solemnly, by which we testify our belief, that God dwells in the heavens, and governs the world. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - GEN:14:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Woof-thread.</i> The first word is added by way of explanation. Abram declares he will not receive the smallest present for himself.
      v:024:
        - 'GEN:14:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Their shares,</i> due to them on account of the danger to which they had exposed themselves. The king of Sodom could not but accept these conditions with gratitude. In a just war, whatever is taken by the enemy, cannot be reclaimed by the original proprietor, if it be retaken. (Grotius, iii. 6. de Jure.)'

      v:002:
        - 'GEN:15:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>I shall go.</i> To what purpose should I heap up riches, since I have no son to inherit them? Abram knew that God had promised him a numerous posterity; but he was not apprized how this was to be verified, and whether he was to adopt some other for his son and heir. Therefore, he asks modestly, how he ought to understand the promise. --- <i>And the son,</i> &c. Hebrew is differently rendered, "and the steward of my house, this Eliezer of Damascus." We know not whether Eliezer or Damascus be the proper name. The Septuagint have "the son of Mesech, my handmaid, this Eliezer of Damascus." Most people suppose, that Damascus was the son of Eliezer, the steward. The sentence is left unfinished, and must be supplied from the following verse, <i>shall be my heir.</i> The son of the steward, <i>filius procurationis,</i> may mean the steward himself, as the son of perdition denotes the person lost. (Calmet)'

This <i>darkness</i> represented the dismal situation of Joseph, confined in a dungeon; and of the Hebrews condemned to hard labour, in making bricks, and obliged to hide their male children, for fear of their being discovered, and slain. Before these unhappy days commenced, the posterity of Abram were exposed to great oppression among the Chanaanites, nor could they in any sense be said to possess the land of promise, for above 400 years after this prophetic sleep. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - 'GEN:15:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Strangers, and under bondage,</i> &c. This prediction may be dated from the persecution of Isaac by Ismael, in the year of the world 2112, till the Jews left Egypt, 2513. In Exodus xii., and St. Paul, 430 years are mentioned; but they probably began when Abram went first into Egypt, 2084. Nicholas Abram and Tournemine say, the Hebrews remained in Egypt full 430 years, from the captivity of Joseph; and reject the addition of the Septuagint which adds, "they and their fathers dwelt in Egypt, and in Chanaan." On these points, we may expect to find chronologists at variance.'

Cadmus was of this nation, of the race of the Heveans, dwelling in the environs of mount Hermon, whence his wife was called Hermione. He was, perhaps, one of those who fled at the approach of Josue; and was said to have sowed dragons' teeth, to people his city of Thebes in Beotia, from an allusion to the name of the Hevites, which signifies serpents.

      v:002:
        - 'GEN:16:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>May have.</i> Hebrew, "may be built up," a metaphorical expression: so God is said to have built up houses for the Egyptian midwives, Exodus i. 21. (Menochius)'

        - "GEN:16:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Ten years</i> after she was 65; which shews that she might reasonably conclude she would now have no children herself; and as she knew God had promised Abram a son, she thought he might follow the custom of those times, and have him by a second wife. Abram shewed no eagerness on this matter, but only yielded to his wife's petition, <i>deprecanti,</i> being well aware of the inconveniences of polygamy, which Sarai had soon reason to observe. This is the first time we read of polygamy since the deluge; but it is not mentioned as any thing singular or unlawful. This was a matter in which God could dispense; but it was never left to the disposal of any man. Hence, when Luther and his associates ventured to dispense with the Landgrave of Hesse, to keep two wives at once, he required him to keep it a secret, being ashamed of his own conduct. He still maintained it was a thing indifferent, even in the law of grace, though Christ has so expressly condemned it. See præp 62, 65. The practice, so common of late in this country, of marrying again after a bill of divorce has been passed, is no less contrary to the Catholic doctrine, which allows only a separation of the parties from bed and board, in cases of adultery; but never of a second marriage, while both the parties are living. (1 Corinthians vii.; St. Augustine de Adult. Conj. i., City of God xvi. 25, 38; and other fathers.) (Haydock) --- It was never lawful for one woman to have two husbands. (Worthington) --- <i>To wife.</i> Plurality of wives, though contrary to the primitive institution of marriage, Genesis ii. 24, was by Divine dispensation allowed to the patriarchs; which allowance seems to have continued during the time of the law of Moses. But Christ our Lord reduced marriage to its primitive institution, St. Matthew xix."

Hebrew may be: "what! have I seen (do I live) after He has seen me." The Hebrews generally supposed, that death would presently overtake the person who had seen the Lord or his angel.

(Menochius) (Tirinus) --- God always appoints some sign of his covenants, as Jesus Christ instituted the holy sacrament of his body and blood, under exterior appearances, to assure us of his new alliance with Christians. (Calmet) --- The sacraments of the old law caused grace, only by means of faith in the Redeemer, of which they were signs.

St. Augustine reading on the eighth day, concluded that as a child of that age, could not, with reason, be put to death for an offense, in which he could have no share, the destruction here threatened is that of the soul, for transgressing, in Adam, the original covenant, and dying in that state unclean, must be excluded from heaven, as people are now who die unbaptized. This difficult passage may, however, be explained as if the threat regarded the negligent parents. "He who shall not circumcise...shall be destroyed."

He endeavours to gain time, hoping perhaps that his guests would escape by some back way, while he is talking to the people. (Haydock) ---Some allow that, under so great a perturbation of mind, he consented to an action which could never be allowed, though it was a less evil. (Menochius)'

The younger is rather more modest, and calls her son Ammon, "my people," not born of the Sodomites. Many reasons might be alleged to extenuate, or even to excuse the conduct of Lot and his daughters, as many of the fathers have done. But the Scripture barely leaves it upon record, without either commendation or blame. (Haydock)'

He was encouraged to do this, by the protection which God had shewn him in Egypt. --- <i>Took her,</i> against her will, as Pharao had done. (Haydock) --- Though she was ninety years old, and with child, her beauty was still extraordinary, the Rabbin think miraculous. At that time people lived above 120 years; so that at the age of ninety, she would only be about as near the end of her life as our women are at forty; and we often see people sufficiently attracting at that age. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - "GEN:20:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Abimelech.</i> This was an usual title of kings in Chanaan, and a very good one, to remind them and their subjects, of their obligations, (Haydock) as it means \"my father the king.\" The behaviour of the prince shews, that as yet all sense of duty and knowledge of the true God was not banished from the country. (Calmet) --- <i>Shalt die,</i> unless thou restore the woman, whom thou hast taken by force; on whose account I have already afflicted thee, (Ver. 7, 17.) and thus prevented thee from touching her. This testimony was more requisite, that there might be no doubt respecting Isaac's legitimacy. (Haydock)"

Is not this sufficient encouragement for us, to have recourse to the intercession of the saints? And can any one be so foolish as to pretend this is making gods of them, and shewing them an idolatrous worship? (Haydock)'

He expostulates with him in a friendly but earnest manner. --- <i>A great sin,</i> or punishment, (Menochius) ver. 18, and exposed me to the danger of committing adultery. Abraham might have answered, this would have been his own fault, as he could not have done it without offering violence to Sara, in whose chastity he could confide. Having an opportunity here to vindicate himself, Abraham speaks freely, which he was not allowed to do in Egypt, chap. xii. 20.'
      v:012:
        - "GEN:20:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>My sister,</i> or niece, according to those who say she was daughter of Aran, who thus must have had a different mother from Abraham; (Menochius) or, as we rather think, Sara was <i>truly</i> his half-<em>sister,</em> born of Thare by another wife. His adding <i>truly,</i> seems to restrain it to this sense; and we know that in those countries, marriages of such near relations were allowed, though not when both had the same parents. Why should we not, therefore, believe Abraham, who certainly knew the real state of the question, and who would not tell a lie, rather than seek for improbable and far-fetched solutions? Said, who lived eight hundred years ago, mentions the name of Jona, Abraham's mother, as well as that of Tehevita, who bore Sara to Thare. The Hebrews, in general, give this explanation. (Calmet) --- By calling Sara his sister without any addition, Abraham intended that the people should conclude he was not married: therefore he did not say she was his half-sister, as this would have frustrated his design, if, as St. Clement of Alexandria, asserts, such might and did marry under the law of nature. (Haydock) --- Philo observes, the Athenian legislator, Solon, sanctioned the same practice, which was followed also by the Phœnicians. (Calmet)"

It was to be so rich, that all might know her quality. St. Paul (1 Corinthians xi. 5, 15.) orders women to be <i>covered.</i> (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'GEN:20:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Healed.</i> It is not known how God afflicted Abimelech; but the women could not be delivered during the short time that Sara was detained: on her being set at liberty, <i>they bore children.</i> (Menochius)'

The play tended to pervert the morals of the young Isaac, whether we understand this term <i>metsachak,</i> as implying idolatry, or obscene actions, or fighting; in all which senses it is used in Scripture. See Exodus xxxii. 6; Genesis xxvi. 8; 2 Kings ii. 14. (Menochius)  Ismael was 13 years older than Isaac; and took occasion, perhaps, from the <i>feast,</i> and other signs of preference given by his parents to the latter, to hate and persecute him, which Sara soon perceiving, was forced to have recourse to the expedient apparently so harsh, of driving Ismael and his mother from the house, that they might have an establishment of their own, and not disturb Isaac in the inheritance after the death of Abraham. (Haydock) --- In this she was guided by a divine light; (Menochius) and not by any female antipathy, ver. 12. Many of the actions of worldlings, which at first sight may appear innocent, have a natural and fatal tendency to pervert the morals of the just; and therefore, we must keep as much as possible at a distance from their society. --- <i>With Isaac her son.</i> Hebrew has simply <i>mocking,</i> without mentioning what. But the sequel shews the true meaning; and this addition was found in some Bibles in the days of St. Jerome, as he testifies, and is expressed in the Septuagint. (Haydock) --- Ismael was a figure of the synagogue, which persecuted the Church of Christ in her birth. (Du Hamel)'

Thither Abraham frequently repaired, to thank God for all his favours. Temples were not probably as yet known in any part of the world. The ancient saints, Abraham, Isaac, Josue, &c., were pleased to shew their respect for God, and their love of retirement, by planting groves, and consecrating altars to the supreme Deity. If this laudable custom was afterwards perverted by the idolaters, and hence forbidden to God's people, we need not wonder. The best things may be abused; and when they become a source of scandal, we must avoid them. (Haydock) --- (Josue xxix. 26[xx. 16?]; Deuteronomy xvi. 23[21?]; Judges vi. 25.)"

(Calmet) --- <i>And weep.</i> In the middle of this word, in the printed Hebrew, there is left a small c; whence the Rabbins ridiculously infer, that Abraham wept but a short time.

For this last reason, the Jews still observe the custom of sitting upon the hand of the person who takes an oath. (Menochius) See chap. xlvii. 29, where Jacob imitates the action of his grand-father. These two patriarchs, progenitors of Christ, are the only ones in Scripture whom we find practising it; whence St. Augustine and St. Ambrose conclude, that it had a reference to the mysterious birth of our Redeemer.

This perfectly agrees with the style of the heroic ages; such as we find expressed in the poems of Homer, the most ancient work of any heathen author.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'GEN:25:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Cetura,</i> his third wife; the former two being perhaps both dead. This Abraham did in his 137th year, that God might have witnesses also among the Gentiles. Cetura was before one of his handmaids. (Menochius) --- God enabled him to have children at this advanced age; or perhaps, Moses may have related his marriage in this place, though it had taken place several years before. (St. Augustine, contra Jul. iii.) (Calmet) This learned father, City of God xvi. 34, supposes that the reason why Cetura is styled a concubine, though she was a lawful and only wife, is because her children prefigured heretics, who do not belong to the kingdom of Christ. (Worthington)'
      v:006:
        - "GEN:25:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Concubines.</i> Agar and Cetura are here called <i>concubines,</i> (though they were lawful wives, and in other places are so called) because they were of an inferior degree: and such in Scripture are usually called concubines. (Challoner) --- The solemnities of marriage were omitted on these occasions, and the children were not entitled to a share in the inheritance. Jacob's two wives consented that all his children, by their handmaids, should be placed on the same footing with their own. (Calmet) --- Abraham contented himself with making suitable <i>presents</i> to the children, whom he had by these secondary wives, reserving the bulk of his property to Isaac, chap. xxiv. 36. He also provided for their establishment himself, that there might be no contest after his departure."
      v:008:
        - 'GEN:25:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Good old age.</i> Because well spent: though he lived not so long as many of the wicked; <i>decaying</i> not by any violent disorder, but dropping off like a ripe apple. --- <i>Being full.</i> The Hebrew does not express of what; but the Samaritan, Chaldean, Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic agree with the Vulgate. See chap. xxxv. 29. (Haydock) --- <i>Days,</i> not <i>years,</i> as Protestants wrongfully interpolate. (Kennicott) --- <i>His people,</i> the saints of ancient days, in limbo; while his body was placed near the remains of his wife, by the pious attention of his two chief sons, attended by their other brethren. (Haydock) --- The life of Abraham was a pattern of all virtues, but particularly of faith; and it was an abridgment of the law. His equal was no where found, Ecclesiasticus xliv. 20. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'GEN:25:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>By their castles;</i> or, the castles, towns, and tribes of principal note, received their names from these twelve princes, or phylarks, whose authority is still recognized among all the tribes of the Arabs. (Thevenot.) (Haydock) --- The towns of these people were easily built, and more easily destroyed; for they consisted only of tents, Jeremias xlix. 31. Their castles were perhaps only <i>sheep-folds,</i> as the original <i>Tiroth</i> may signify; or they were a sort of watch-towers, to prevent the sudden attack of an invading enemy, and to serve also for a retreat. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - "GEN:25:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>In the presence,</i> &c. As he was the eldest, so he died first; having lived unmolested and fearless among his father's children, chap. xvi. 12. (Calmet)"
      v:021:
        - 'GEN:25:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Barren.</i> They had been married 20 years, (ver. 26.) during which time, St. Chrysostom says, Isaac had earnestly besought the Lord, (Menochius) and obtained by prayer what God long before decreed. See St. Gregory, Dial. i. 8. (Worthington)'
      v:022:
        - 'GEN:25:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>To be so.</i> That is, if I must die, and my children also. She feared the worst; and immediately had recourse to the Lord, either in her oratory, or at one of his altars erected by Abraham; and received a gracious answer from him by means of an angel. (Haydock) --- Others think she consulted Melchisedech at Mount Moria. (Menochius)'
      v:023:
        - 'GEN:25:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>The younger.</i> The Idumeans shall be subdued by the arms of David: and the Jews themselves shall yield to the Christian Church. (St. Augustine, City of God xvi. 35.) St. Paul, Romans ix, draws another very important truth from this history, shewing the mercy of God to be gratuitous in choosing his saints. (Worthington)'
      v:025:
        - "GEN:25:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Red.</i> Hence he was called Edom, as well as from the red pottage, ver. 30. (Haydock) --- <i>Hairy like a skin.</i> On which account Rebecca afterwards clothed Jacob's hands and neck with the skins of kids, to make him resemble Esau. Furry robes were not unusual among the Jews. Some imagine that the name of <i>Sehar,</i> was given to Esau, on account of his being <i>hairy:</i> but <i>Esau</i> was the title by which he was commonly known, and it means <i>one made perfect;</i> because he came into the world, \"covered with hair like a man.\" --- <i>Jacob:</i> \"a supplanter, or wrestler.\" (Calmet) --- From the birth of these twins St. Gregory shews the folly of astrologers, who pretend that our actions are under the influence of the planets; and that two, born at the same moment, will have the same fate. How different were the lives of Jacob and Esau! (Haydock)"
      v:027:
        - 'GEN:25:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>A husbandman:</i> a rustic, both in profession and manners, like Cain; while Jacob was a shepherd, in imitation of Abel, plain and honest. (Haydock)'
      v:028:
        - 'GEN:25:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Loved Esau,</i> as his first-born, who shewed him all attention, and whom he would naturally have appointed his heir, if the will of God had not afterwards been revealed to him. Rebecca, to whom this was already known, gave the preference in her love to Jacob. (Haydock)'
      v:029:
        - 'GEN:25:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Pottage,</i> of Egyptian lentiles, the most excellent in the world. (Calmet)'
      v:030:
        - 'GEN:25:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Give me,</i> &c. Hebrew, "make me devour this red;" which denotes, the very red quality of the pottage, and the greediness of Esau. (Calmet)'
      v:031:
        - "GEN:25:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Sell me.</i> He had been informed by his mother, that God had transferred the <i>birth-right</i> to him; and, therefore, he takes this opportunity to obtain the consent of Esau quietly. The latter, who knew nothing of God's decree, shewed his little regard for that privilege. (Haydock) --- He perhaps intended to assert his claim by force, notwithstanding this agreement. (Menochius) --- It is not probable that he could plead in earnest, that he was famishing in the midst of his father's house. (Du Hamel) --- The birth-right was a temporal honour; though some assert, that the office of priesthood belonged also to it. This, however, does not seem to be certain; for we find Abel, Abraham, and other younger children offering sacrifice. The first-born were entitled to a double portion, (Deuteronomy xxi. 17; 1 Paralipomenon v. 2, 5) and to their father's peculiar blessing, Ecclesiasticus iii. 12.[11.?] To despise such advantages betrayed a bad disposition, for which Esau is condemned, Hebrews xii. 16; Romans ix. (Calmet) --- Jacob's conduct was perfectly innocent, whether we consider this transaction as serious or not. Isaac never ratified the bargain; nor do we find that Jacob rested his claim on it. (Haydock) --- But it is recorded by Moses, to shew the disposition of these two young men. (Calmet)"
      v:033:
        - 'GEN:25:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Swore;</i> and still we find him enraged above measure, when Isaac had, by mistake, ratified the transfer of the birth-right to Jacob; (Chap. xxvii. 41.) whence we may gather, that he did not intend to perform what he promised, even with the solemnity of an oath; which renders him still more deserving of the title <i>profane,</i> which St. Paul gives him. (Haydock)'

So far is certain, that the first birth-right, both by divine election, and by Esau's free cession, belonged to Jacob: so that if there were any lie in the case, it could be no more than an officious and venial one. (Challoner) --- Ignorance might also excuse them from any sin; as many good and learned men have thought an officious lie to be lawful. (St. Chrysostom, hom. 52; Origen; Bonfrere.) And even if we allow that they did wrong; the Scripture relates, but does not sanction what they did, <i>Let him that thinks himself to stand, take heed, lest he fall,</i> 1 Corinthians x. 12.

But God had disposed of it otherwise. The profane and cruel manners of Esau rendered him unworthy of it; and he could not maintain his natural claim, after having freely resigned it even with an oath. He seems to distinguish the blessing from the birth-right, though one necessarily followed the other. (Haydock)'
      v:037:

(Haydock) --- <i>In the fat,</i> &c. Idumea was a barren country; and hence some would translate the Hebrew, \"far from the fat...shall thy dwelling be; but thou shalt live by the sword.\" Thus <i>min</i> often means <i>from,</i> as well as for <i>in: my flesh is changed on account of</i> the want of <i>oil,</i> Psalm cviii. 24. Hebrew, <i>a pinguedine.</i> (Calmet) --- But all the ancient versions agree with the Vulgate. So that we may say, the blessing of God made those barren regions supply the wants of the people abundantly; and as the Idumeans were to live by the sword, they would seize the rich habitations of their neighbours, (Haydock) and thus obtain a country rendered fertile without their labour.

(Haydock) --- All the blessing of Esau, tends to confirm that already given to his brother; so that the apostle seems to have considered it unworthy of notice. (Calmet) --- Jacob, in the mean time, never asserted his dominion; but still called Esau his lord, (Chap. xxxii. 4.) and behaved to him with the greatest deference. (Haydock) --- Yet the Idumeans always hated the Jews, and assisted Titus to destroy Jerusalem. (Josephus) (Tirinus)'
      v:041:

(Menochius) --- Her love for Jacob filled him with greater indignation; and he resolved to murder him, in order, perhaps, to revenge himself on both. Though this cruel resolution was taken <i>in his heart,</i> with full deliberation, he was not so careful to conceal his intentions; but his watchful mother discovered it, and by her prudence, preserved him from committing the external sin: and Jacob from falling a prey to this second Cain.'

        - 'GEN:27:45 | 45 | 45 | <i>Both my sons.</i> Esau would have forfeited his life for murder, chap. ix. 6. (Haydock) --- Perhaps she might also fear that Jacob, in his own defence, should, in the very agony of death, give the aggressor a mortal wound; or that Esau, at least, would be forced to flee his country. Indeed, she considered him already as a lost man, on account of his marriage with the two women of Chanaan, and his savage manners. (Calmet)'

    verses:
      v:001: 'GEN:27:1 | 1 | 1 | Now Isaac was old, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and his eyes were dim, and he could not see: and he called Esau, his elder son, and said to him: My son? And he answered: Here I am.'

      v:005: "GEN:27:5 | 5 | 5 | And when Rebecca had heard this, and he was gone into the field to fulfil his father's commandment,"
      v:006: 'GEN:27:6 | 6 | 6 | She said to her son Jacob: I heard thy father talking with Esau, thy brother, and saying to him:'

      v:010: 'GEN:27:10 | 10 | 10 | Which when thou hast brought in, and he hath eaten, he may bless thee before he die.'
      v:011: 'GEN:27:11 | 11 | 11 | And he answered her: Thou knowest that Esau, my brother, is a hairy man, and I am smooth:'
      v:012: 'GEN:27:12 | 12 | 12 | If my father should feel me, and perceive it, I fear lest he will think I would have mocked him, and I shall bring upon me a curse instead of a blessing.'
      v:013: 'GEN:27:13 | 13 | 13 | And his mother said to him: Upon me be this curse, my son: only hear thou my voice, and go, fetch me the things which I have said.'
      v:014: 'GEN:27:14 | 14 | 14 | He went, and brought, and gave them to his mother. She dressed meats, such as she knew his father liked.'
      v:015: 'GEN:27:15 | 15 | 15 | And she put on him very good garments of Esau, which she had at home with her:'
      v:016: 'GEN:27:16 | 16 | 16 | And the little skins of the kids she put about his hands, and covered the bare of his neck.'
      v:017: 'GEN:27:17 | 17 | 17 | And she gave him the savoury meat, and delivered him bread that she had baked.'

      v:019: 'GEN:27:19 | 19 | 19 | And Jacob said: I am Esau, thy first-born: I have done as thou didst command me; arise, sit, and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.'
      v:020: 'GEN:27:20 | 20 | 20 | And Isaac said to his son: How couldst thou find it so quickly, my son? He answered: It was the will of God, that what I sought came quickly in my way:'
      v:021: 'GEN:27:21 | 21 | 21 | And Isaac said: Come hither, that I may feel thee, my son, and may prove whether thou be my son Esau, or no.'
      v:022: 'GEN:27:22 | 22 | 22 | He came near to his father, and when he had felt him, Isaac said: The voice indeed is the voice of Jacob; but the hands, are the hands of Esau.'
      v:023: 'GEN:27:23 | 23 | 23 | And he knew him not, because his hairy hands made him like to the elder. Then blessing him,'
      v:024: 'GEN:27:24 | 24 | 24 | He said: Art thou my son Esau? He answered: I am.'
      v:025: 'GEN:27:25 | 25 | 25 | Then he said: Bring me the meats of thy hunting, my son, that my soul may bless thee. And when they were brought, and he had eaten, he offered him wine also, which after he had drunk,'
      v:026: 'GEN:27:26 | 26 | 26 | He said to him: Come near me, and give me a kiss, my son.'
      v:027: 'GEN:27:27 | 27 | 27 | He came near, and kissed him. And immediately as he smelled the fragrant smell of his garments, blessing him, he said: Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful field, which the Lord hath blessed.'
      v:028: 'GEN:27:28 | 28 | 28 | God give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, abundance of corn and wine.'
      v:029: "GEN:27:29 | 29 | 29 | And let peoples serve thee, and tribes worship thee: be thou lord of thy brethren, and let thy mother's children bow down before thee. Cursed be he that curseth thee: and let him that blesseth thee be filled with blessings."
      v:030: 'GEN:27:30 | 30 | 30 | Isaac had scarce ended his words, when, Jacob being now gone out abroad, Esau came,'
      v:031: "GEN:27:31 | 31 | 31 | And brought in to his father meats, made of what he had taken in hunting, saying: Arise, my father, and eat of thy son's venison; that thy soul may bless me."
      v:032: 'GEN:27:32 | 32 | 32 | And Isaac said to him: Why! who art thou? He answered: I am thy first-born son, Esau.'
      v:033: 'GEN:27:33 | 33 | 33 | Isaac was struck with fear, and astonished exceedingly; and wondering beyond what can be believed, said: Who is he then that even now brought me venison that he had taken, and I ate of all before thou camest? and I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed.'
      v:034: "GEN:27:34 | 34 | 34 | Esau having heard his father's words, roared out with a great cry; and, being in a consternation, said: Bless me also, my father."
      v:035: 'GEN:27:35 | 35 | 35 | And he said: Thy brother came deceitfully and got thy blessing.'
      v:036: 'GEN:27:36 | 36 | 36 | But he said again: Rightly is his name called Jacob; for he hath supplanted me lo this second time: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}My first birth-right he took away before, and now this second time he hath stolen away my blessing. And again he said to his father: Hast thou not reserved me also a blessing?'
      v:037: 'GEN:27:37 | 37 | 37 | Isaac answered: I have appointed him thy lord, and have made all his brethren his servants: I have established him with corn and wine, and after this, what shall I do more for thee, my son?'
      v:038: 'GEN:27:38 | 38 | 38 | And Esac said to him: Hast thou only one blessing, father? I beseech thee bless me also. And when he wept with a loud cry,{VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}'
      v:039: 'GEN:27:39 | 39 | 39 | Isaac being moved, said to him: In the fat of the earth, and in the dew of heaven from above,'
      v:040: 'GEN:27:40 | 40 | 40 | Shall thy blessing be. Thou shalt live by the sword, and shalt serve thy brother: and the time shall come, when thou shalt shake off and loose his yoke from thy neck.'
      v:041: 'GEN:27:41 | 41 | 41 | Esau therefore always hated Jacob, for the blessing wherewith his father had blessed him; and he said in his heart: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}The days will come of the mourning for my father, and I will kill my brother Jacob.'
      v:042: 'GEN:27:42 | 42 | 42 | These things were told to Rebecca: and she sent and called Jacob, her son, and said to him: Behold Esau, thy brother, threateneth to kill thee.'
      v:043: 'GEN:27:43 | 43 | 43 | Now therefore, my son, hear my voice, arise and flee to Laban, my brother, to Haran:'
      v:044: 'GEN:27:44 | 44 | 44 | And thou shalt dwell with him a few days, till the wrath of thy brother be assuaged,'
      v:045: 'GEN:27:45 | 45 | 45 | And his indignation cease, and he forget the things thou hast done to him: afterwards I will send, and bring thee from thence hither. Why shall I be deprived of both my sons in one day?'
      v:046: 'GEN:27:46 | 46 | 46 | And Rebecca said to Isaac: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the stock of this land, I choose not to live.'

    commentary:
      v:002:
        - "GEN:28:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Take.</i> Septuagint, \"flee;\" as if Isaac began at last to be apprized of Esau's designs. Wisdom (x. 10) <i>conducted the just when he fled from his brother's wrath,</i> &c. --- <i>Thy uncle.</i> He points out the house, but leaves the woman to his choice."
      v:004:
        - 'GEN:28:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Grandfather.</i> Isaac, out of modesty, does not mention that the same promises had been made to himself. He determines the right over Chanaan to belong solely to Jacob, and to his posterity. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - "GEN:28:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>To Ismael's</i> family; for he had been dead fourteen years. Esau asks no advice. It is doubtful whether he meant to appease or irritate his parents, (Menochius) by this marriage with the daughter of Ismael. She lived with her brother, the head of the Nabutheans, and is called Basemath, chap. xxxvi. 3. (Calmet)"
      v:011:
        - 'GEN:28:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Head</i> for a pillow. Behold the austerity of the heir of all that country! (Haydock) --- He departs from home in haste, with his staff only, that Esau might not know. (Worthington)'
      v:012:
        - 'GEN:28:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>A ladder and angels,</i> &c. This mysterious vision tended to comfort the patriarch, with the assurance that God would now take him under his more particular protection, when he was destitute of human aid. (Haydock) --- The angels <i>ascending,</i> foretold that his journey would be prosperous; and <i>descending,</i> shewed that he would return with safety. (Menochius) --- Or rather, the ladder represented the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, born of so many patriarchs from Adam, who was created by God, to the blessed Virgin Mary. He is the <i>way</i> by which we must ascend, by observing the <i>truth,</i> till we obtain <i>life</i> eternal. (Haydock) --- Mercy and truth are like the two sides; the virtues of Christ are signified by the steps. Angels descend to announce this joyful mystery to men; they ascend to convey the prayers and ardent desires of the ancient saints, to hasten their redemption. (Menochius) --- Our Saviour seems to allude to this passage, John i. 51; xiv. 6. The Providence of God, watching over all things, appears here very conspicuous.'
      v:013:
        - 'GEN:28:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Thy father,</i> or grandfather. God joins the dead with the living, to shew that all live to him, and that the soul is immortal. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - 'GEN:28:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Knew it not.</i> Jacob was not ignorant that God fills all places. But he thought that he would not manifest himself thus in a land given to idolatry. He begins to suspect that the place had been formerly consecrated to the worship of the true God, (Calmet) as it probably had by Abraham, who dwelt near Bethel, (Chap. xii. 8, ) and built an altar on Mount Moria, chap. xxii. 14. Interpreters are not agreed on which of these places Jacob spent the night. St. Augustine, q. 83, supposes it was on the latter, "where God appointed the tabernacle to remain." The Chaldean paraphrases it very well in this sense, ver. 17, "How terrible is this place! It is not an ordinary place, but a place beloved by God, and over against this place is the door of heaven." (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - 'GEN:28:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>A title.</i> That is, a pillar or monument. (Challoner) --- Or an altar, consecrated by that rite to the service of the true God. This he did without any superstition; as the Catholic Church still pours oil or chrism upon her altars, in imitation of Jacob. (Rabanus, Instit. i. 45.) If pagans did the like, this is no reason why we should condemn the practice. They were blamable for designing thus to worship false gods. (St. Clement of Alexandria, strom. vii; Apuleius, Florid. i; &c.) If Protestants pull down altars, under the plea of their being superstitious, we cannot but pity their ignorance or malice. (Worthington)'
      v:019:
        - 'GEN:28:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Bethel.</i> This name signifies the house of God. (Challoner) --- Bethel was the name which Jacob gave to the place; and the town, which was built after his return, was called by the same name. Hence those famous animated stones or idols, received their title (<i>Bethules,</i> Eusebius, præp. i. 10.) being consecrated to Saturn, the Sun, &c. Till the days of Mahomet, the Arabs adored a rough stone, taken from the temple of Mecca, which they pretended was built by Abraham. (Chardin) --- <i>Luza,</i> so called from the number of nut or almond trees. Here the golden calf was afterwards set up, on the confines of the tribes of Benjamin and of Ephraim, (Calmet) the southern limits of the kingdom of Jeroboam. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'GEN:28:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>A vow;</i> not simply that he would acknowledge one God, but that he would testify his peculiar veneration for him, by erecting an altar, at his return, and by giving voluntarily the tithes of all he had. (Worthington) (Chap. xxxv. 7.) How he gave these tithes, we do not read. Perhaps he might hereby engage his posterity to give them under the law of Moses. (Calmet)'

These two sisters represented the synagogue and the Church of Christ. Lia, though married first, never gains the entire affection of her husband. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - "GEN:29:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>For Rachel.</i> It was then the custom to buy or to pay a dowry for a wife. (Chap. xxxiv. 12; Osee iii. 2.) Herodotus says, i. 196, that the Babylonians sold their beautiful women as high as possible, and gave part of the price to help off the more deformed. The Turks do the like. (Calmet) --- <i>A few,</i> &c. So highly did he esteem Rachel, that he thought he had obtained her for just nothing, though delays naturally seem long to lovers. (Tirinus) --- Calmet supposes that he was married to her the second month after he arrived at Haran; and on this account, easily explains his words, as love made all labour tolerable, and even easy, in the enjoyment of the beautiful Rachel. Usher also places the birth of Ruben in the first year of Jacob's service, A. 2246[the year of the world 2246]. But Salien and the context decide, that he waited full seven years, and then obtained Lia, by fraud, of Laban; and seven days after, Rachel. (Haydock) --- He was then 84 years old! (Du Hamel)"

In consequence of this imposition, the legitimacy of Ruben's conception was rendered doubtful.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'GEN:30:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Envied,</i> or desired to have children like her. Thus we may envy the virtues of the saints. (Calmet) --- <i>Give me,</i> &c. These words seem to indicate a degree of impatience, at which we need not be surprised, when we reflect, that Rachel had been educated among idolaters. (Menochius) --- <i>Die</i> of grief and shame. "I shall be considered as one dead." (Jun.[Junius?]) St. Chrysostom thinks she threatened to lay violent hands on herself, and through jealousy, spoke in a foolish manner. This passion is capable of the basest actions, (Haydock) and is almost unavoidable where polygamy reigns. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'GEN:30:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Angry</i> at the rash and apparently blasphemous demand of Rachel. (Menochius) --- <i>As God, pro Deo.</i> Am I to work a miracle in opposition to God, who has made thee barren? To him thou oughtest to address thyself. The Hebrews justly observe, that God has reserved to himself the four keys of nature: 1. Of generation; 2. Of sustenance, Psalm cxliv. 16; 3. Of rain, Deuteronomy xxviii. 12; And, 4. Of the grave or resurrection, Ezechiel xxxvii. 12. (Tirinus)'
      v:003:
        - 'GEN:30:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Servant,</i> like a maid of honour. Josephus says she was not a slave, no more than Zelpha. --- <i>My knees,</i> whom I may nurse with pleasure. It was an ancient custom to place the new-born infants upon the knees of some near relation, who gave them a name, and thus in a manner adopted them. (Chap. l. 22[23, in some Bibles]; Job iii. 12; Psalm xxi. 11.) (Homer) (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - 'GEN:30:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Marriage.</i> The Manichees condemned Jacob for having four wives at once. But St. Augustine replied, it was not then unusual or forbidden. He took the two last only at the pressing instigation of Rachel and Lia, and that only for the sake of children. Lia herself was forced upon him. (contra Faust. xxii. 48.)'
      v:006:
        - "GEN:30:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Dan,</i> means judgment. From the same root as Adonis; <i>Adoni,</i> my lord or judge, &c. Rachel's whole solicitude was for children. (Haydock)"
      v:008:
        - 'GEN:30:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Compared me,</i> &c. As Lia treacherously got my husband, so I have craftily surmounted the difficulties of barrenness; I have struggled earnestly, and have got the victory. <i>Patal,</i> means to act with cunning. (Psalm xvii. 27.) (Calmet) --- <i>Nephtali,</i> "a crafty wrestler." (Menochius)'
      v:011:
        - 'GEN:30:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Happily,</i> fortunately. --- <i>Gad,</i> or Bonaventure. (Haydock) ---"Good-fortune," was acknowledge by the pagans for a divinity; (Isaias lxv. 11.) perhaps for the Sun, or Oromagdes, the <i>Gad of Aram.</i> He was opposed to the wicked Arimenes in the Chaldean theology, by Zoroaster, (Calmet) the inventor of the Two Principles. Whether Lia intended to attribute this child to the influence of the planet Jupiter, the Sun, or some other tool, we cannot determine. (Haydock) --- Her naming may be simply; Behold I am now a mother of a troop, or little army, <i>Gad;</i> and to which (Chap. xlix. 19.) Jacob evidently alludes. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - 'GEN:30:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Aser:</i> happy. My servant has now had as many sons as my sister (Menochius) and I have given them both names, indicating my great felicity and joy. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - 'GEN:30:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Ruben,</i> now perhaps about four years old, playing in the fields, in the latter <i>harvest</i> time, (Exodus ix. 32) <i>found mandrakes</i> of an extraordinary beauty and <i>flavour,</i> (Canticle of Canticles vii. 13.) whether they were flowers, lilies, jasmine, &c. as some translate; or rather, fruits of the mandrake tree, according to all the ancient versions; or of the citron, lemon, or orange tree, if we believe Calmet. <i>Dudaim</i> designates two breasts, or something lovely and protuberant. The ancients have spoken with admiration, and have attributed wonderful effects to the mandrakes, which, though controverted by moderns, might suffice to make Rachel greatly desire to have them; at least, if she believed they would contribute to remove her sterility, as Pliny, Natural History xxv. 15. Aristotle (de Gener. ii.) and other naturalists of eminence, have maintained they did. (Haydock) --- The effect which she desired so much, was not, however, to be attributed to them, since she conceived only three years after, and that by the blessing of God. (Tirinus)'
      v:015:
        - "GEN:30:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>From me.</i> Lia was aware that Jacob's affection lay entirely towards Rachel; particularly now as she had ceased to bear children herself. (Haydock) --- <i>This might,</i> when it is my turn to have him. To prevent any jealousy, the husband visited his wives one after another, as was the case with Smerdis, the king of Persia. (Herodotus iii. 79; Exodus xxi. 10.) (Calmet)"
      v:018:
        - 'GEN:30:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Issachar,</i> "the reward of the man, <i>or</i> husband." (Calmet) --- She might allude also to the reward she had obtained for her mandrakes. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'GEN:30:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Zabulon,</i> "dwelling or cohabiting." Zobad (which resembles the sound of Zobal) means to endow, (Calmet) to which she seems also to refer; as if her marriage was renewed, and God had given her more children for a dowry. (Menochius)'
      v:021:
        - 'GEN:30:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Dina,</i> "judgment," like Dan. God hath done me justice. The Hebrews assert that Dina was married to holy Job. She was born the same year as Joseph, the 91st of Jacob. Lia brought forth seven children in seven years.'
      v:024:
        - 'GEN:30:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Joseph.</i> In imposing this name, Rachel looks both to the past and to the future; thanking God for <i>taking away</i> (asop) her reproach, and begging that He <i>would add</i> (isop or Joseph) the blessing of another son, as he really did, though it occasioned her death: so little do we know what we ask for! Joseph means one "adding or increasing," chap. xlix. 22. (Haydock) --- He was born when the 14 years of <i>service</i> were over; being a most glorious figure of Jesus Christ, who came to redeem us from slavery. (Du Hamel)'
      v:028:
        - 'GEN:30:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Give thee.</i> He wishes to engage him to continue in his service; being convinced, that a faithful and pious servant is a great treasure. Laban promises every thing, and performs little according to agreement. He never thinks of making Jacob any present for his extraordinary diligence.'
      v:031:
        - 'GEN:30:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Nothing.</i> I am willing to depart with my family towards my father. But if I must stay, these are my terms. (Haydock) --- I require no certain wages, committing myself entirely to what Providence shall send. (Salien.)'
      v:032:
        - "GEN:30:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Speckled;</i> from those which are all of one colour. Those which should be of the former description must belong to Jacob, while all the black and the white should be Laban's. --- <i>Brown,</i> or of a dull mixture of white and black. --- <i>Spotted,</i> having large patches of either colour. --- <i>Divers,</i> little spots variegating the fleece. (Menochius) --- The original is extremely obscure. Jacob asks only for the worst; the speckled sheep and goats, also the black sheep and the white goats, ver. 35. (Bochart.) (Calmet)"
      v:033:
        - 'GEN:30:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Of theft,</i> if they be found in my possession. I am so well convinced that God will reward my justice, that, even contrary to what might naturally be expected, he will enable me to have plenty of spotted sheep and goats, though their mothers be all of one colour. It is not certain, that Jacob agreed to have the flocks parted till the end of the year. (Menochius)'
      v:035:
        - "GEN:30:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>His sons.</i> These continued to observe the conduct of Jacob, while Laban drove off all the flocks of divers colours to so great a distance, ver. 36, that there was no danger of the sheep under Jacob's care getting to them. Thus Laban first began to violate the agreement; and the angel of the Lord suggested to Jacob, the plan by which he was preserved from serving a cruel and avaricious man without wages, chap. xxxi. 12. (Menochius)"
      v:040:
        - "GEN:30:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>All the white,</i> &c. Notwithstanding Jacob's stratagem, some had lambs all of a colour. The force of fancy is very surprising on such occasions. Oppian, Aristotle, and others, recommend Jacob's plan as consonant to nature. (Haydock)"
      v:042:
        - 'GEN:30:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>Later-coming,</i> in autumn, when the spring lambs were of an inferior value. These he was willing to abandon for the most part to Laban; and therefore did not use his rods. Pliny, Natural History viii. 47; and Columella viii. 3, agree, that the lambs which are produced in spring, do not thrive so well as those of autumn, at least in Italy, and in those countries where sheep lamb twice a year. <i>Bis gravidæ pecudes.</i> (Virgil) (Calmet) --- Many who have tried the same experiment as Jacob, have not experienced the same success; whence St. Chrysostom, and most of the Greek fathers, suppose that it was miraculous. (Tirinus)'

      v:026: 'GEN:30:26 | 26 | 26 | Give me my wives, and my children, for whom I have served thee, that I may depart: thou knowest the service that I have rendered thee.'
      v:027: 'GEN:30:27 | 27 | 27 | Laban said to him: Let me find favour in thy sight: I have learned, by experience, that God hath blessed me for thy sake.'
      v:028: GEN:30:28 | 28 | 28 | Appoint thy wages which I shall give thee.
      v:029: 'GEN:30:29 | 29 | 29 | But he answered: Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how great thy possession hath been in my hands.'
      v:030: 'GEN:30:30 | 30 | 30 | Thou hadst but little before I came to thee, and now thou art become rich: and the Lord hath blessed thee at my coming. It is reasonable, therefore, that I should now provide also for my own house.'
      v:031: 'GEN:30:31 | 31 | 31 | And Laban said: What shall I give thee? But he said: I require nothing; but if thou wilt do what I demand, I will feed and keep thy sheep again.'
      v:032: 'GEN:30:32 | 32 | 32 | Go round through all thy flocks, and separate all the sheep of divers colours, and speckled; and all that is brown and spotted, and of divers colours, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall be my wages.'
      v:033: 'GEN:30:33 | 33 | 33 | And my justice shall answer for me to-morrow before thee, when the time of the bargain shall come; and all that is not of divers colours, and spotted, and brown, as well among the sheep as among the goats, shall accuse me of theft.'
      v:034: 'GEN:30:34 | 34 | 34 | And Laban said: I like well what thou demandest.'
      v:035: 'GEN:30:35 | 35 | 35 | And he separated the same day the she-goats, and the sheep, and the he-goats, and the rams of divers colours, and spotted; and all the flock of one colour, that is, of white and black fleece, he delivered into the hands of his sons.'
      v:036: 'GEN:30:36 | 36 | 36 | And he set the space of three days journey betwixt himself and his son-in-law, who fed the rest of his flock.'
      v:037: 'GEN:30:37 | 37 | 37 | And Jacob took green rods of poplar, and of almond, and of plane-trees, and pilled them in part: so when the bark was taken off, in the parts that were pilled, there appeared whiteness: but the parts that were whole, remained green: and by this means the colour was divers.'
      v:038: 'GEN:30:38 | 38 | 38 | And he put them in the troughs, where the water was poured out; that when the flocks should come to drink, they might have the rods before their eyes, and in the sight of them might conceive.'
      v:039: 'GEN:30:39 | 39 | 39 | And it came to pass, that in the very heat of coition, the sheep beheld the rods, and brought forth spotted, and of divers colours, and speckled.'
      v:040: "GEN:30:40 | 40 | 40 | And Jacob separated the flock, and put the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams; and all the white and the black were Laban's, and the rest were Jacob's, when the flocks were separated one from the other."
      v:041: 'GEN:30:41 | 41 | 41 | So when the ewes went first to ram, Jacob put the rods in the troughs of water before the eyes of the rams, and of the ewes, that they might conceive while they were looking upon them.'
      v:042: "GEN:30:42 | 42 | 42 | But when the later coming was, and the last conceiving, he did not put them. And those that were late-ward, became Laban's; and they of the first time, Jacob's."
      v:043: 'GEN:30:43 | 43 | 43 | And the man was enriched exceedingly, and he had many flocks, maid-servants and men-servants, camels and asses.'

        - "GEN:31:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>After that</i> six years were expired, and calumnies and ill-will attended Jacob in Laban's family, God ordered him to retire, ver. 3. (Haydock)"
      v:007:
        - 'GEN:31:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Ten times.</i> Very often, or perhaps this exact number of times, ver. 41.'
      v:008:
        - 'GEN:31:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>All,</i> or the far greatest part, so that I was exceedingly enriched. (Menochius) --- The Septuagint here agrees with the Vulgate. But the Hebrew and other versions, instead of <i>white ones,</i> read <i>of divers colours,</i> or <i>ring-streaked,</i> which takes away the intended opposition. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - "GEN:31:12 | 12 | 12 | Are <i>of divers colours.</i> Their fancy was strongly impressed with these various colours, in consequence of the pilled rods, which they beheld: and which Jacob was directed by the angel to place in the troughs. --- <i>I have seen</i> with displeasure, the injustice of Laban; (Haydock) and therefore, I, the Lord of all things, authorise thee to act in this manner. By this vision, the justice of Jacob would appear; and the authority for removing, given in a second vision, would suffice to induce the two principal wives of Jacob to give their consent to leave their father's house, and to begin a long journey. During the last six years, Providence had given no increase of family, that the little children might be no impediment to the removal. (Haydock)"
      v:015:
        - 'GEN:31:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Eaten up.</i> Laban kept for himself the dowry paid by Jacob for his wives, though he ought to have allotted it to them, with the addition of something more, in proportion to his immense wealth. (Menochius)'
      v:018:
        - 'GEN:31:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Gotten.</i> Hebrew expresses over again, <i>the cattle of his getting,</i> &c., which is omitted in one manuscript, as well as in the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, though yet used in the Samaritan copy. (Kennicott) --- <i>To Isaac,</i> who was still living, though he had apprehended death was at hand 20 years before. He continued to live other 20 years after. (Salien) --- Jacob spent about 10 years at Sichem and at Bethel, before he went to dwell with Isaac. (Menochius)'
      v:019:
        - "GEN:31:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Her father's idols.</i> By this it appears, that Laban was an idolater: and some of the fathers are of opinion, that Rachel stole away these idols, to withdraw him from idolatry, by removing the occasion of his sin. (Challoner) --- Others think she was herself infected with this superstition, till Jacob entirely banished it from his family in Chanaan, chap. xxxv. 2. (Tirinus) --- The Hebrew <i>Teraphim,</i> is translated <i>images</i> by the Protestants in this place, though it certainly denotes idols. But Osee iii. 4, they leave it untranslated, lest they should be forced to allow that images pertain to religious service, as well as <i>sacrifice,</i> &c., which are mentioned together, (Worthington) though they now indeed leave <i>images</i> in the same verse of Osee for what the Vulgate renders <i>altar.</i> These teraphims are consequently taken in a good as well as in a bad sense. They were, perhaps, made of rich metal, and taken by Rachel and Lia to indemnify them for the want of a dowry. This, however, was wrong, and done without the participation of their husband. (Haydock)"
      v:020:
        - 'GEN:31:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Away.</i> Hebrew, "Jacob stole the heart of Laban," concealing his flight from him. (Menochius)'

      v:022:
        - "GEN:31:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Third day.</i> He was gone to shear his sheep, distant three days' journey."
      v:024:
        - 'GEN:31:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Speak not.</i> Laban did not comply exactly, but he used no violence. (Haydock)'
      v:032:
        - 'GEN:31:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Slain.</i> Homer says, "the father judges his children and wives;" and thus Jacob pronounces sentence. The Rabbins pretend it had its effect soon after in the death of Rachel, chap. xxxv. 18. (Calmet)'
      v:035:
        - "GEN:31:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Vain.</i> For who would imagine, that a woman should treat in this manner the objects of her father's adoration? (Calmet) --- It would hence appear, that she did not herself adore them, unless fear overcame her religion. (Haydock)"

        - 'GEN:31:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Exact it.</i> Laban acted in opposition both to custom and to justice, (Calmet) while Jacob forebore to claim what he might have done, agreeably to both. (Haydock)'
      v:042:
        - 'GEN:31:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>The fear of Isaac;</i> or of that God, whom Isaac fears, on account of the danger to which he is exposed of losing his friendship; a thing which, Abraham being now departed in peace, has not to dread. (Calmet)'
      v:043:
        - 'GEN:31:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Are mine,</i> or proceed from me originally; so that if I were to injure them, I should disregard the dictates of nature. (Menochius)'
      v:047:
        - 'GEN:31:47 | 47 | 47 | <i>Testimony.</i> Hebrew makes Laban give this etymology, <i>Jegar-saha-dutha;</i> while <i>Galaad</i> means the hill or the witness. The Syrian language had now begun to deviate some little from the Hebrew of Jacob. --- <i>Each,</i> &c. This is added by the Vulgate. (Calmet)'
      v:049:
        - 'GEN:31:49 | 49 | 49 | <i>Behold.</i> Hebrew, "and Mitspah," or "Hammitspah," the watch-tower, whence God will see us. (Calmet)'

        - 'GEN:31:53 | 53 | 53 | <i>God of Nachor.</i> Hebrew uses Elohim, which is often applied to idols, such as Nachor worshipped along with the true God. (Calmet) --- Jacob swears by the one only God, whom his father revered. (Menochius) --- <i>The God of their father,</i> is omitted in the Septuagint and is deemed an interpolation by Kennicott. The Samaritan reads again <i>the God of Abraham.</i> (Haydock)'

He is called <i>God,</i> ver. 28 and 30, because he represented the person of the Son of God. This wrestling, in which Jacob, assisted by God, was a match for an angel, was so ordered, (Ver. 28.) that he might learn by this experiment of the divine assistance, that neither Esau, nor any other man, should have power to hurt him. It was also spiritual, as appeareth by his earnest prayer, urging, and at last obtaining the angel's blessing. (Challoner) --- The father will not refuse a good gift to those who ask him with fervour and humility. Jacob had before set us an excellent pattern how to pray, placing his confidence in God, and distrusting himself, ver. 9, &c. (Haydock) --- It is not certain, whether Jacob remained <i>alone</i> on the northern or on the southern banks of Jaboc. (Calmet)"

It may also denote pearls, coral, a vessel, or purse of <i>good</i> money. St. Stephen, Acts vii. 19[16?], mentions the <i>price of money.</i> But he probably speaks of the bargain made by Abraham with Ephron, son of Heth, for which some have substituted Hemor, the son of Sichem. Kista in the Chaldean means a vessel or measure; and we learn from Herodotus iii. 130, that the Persians were accustomed to keep their money in this manner. In the Chaldean, Syriac, and Arabic languages, there are words derived from the same root as Kesita, which mean purity, perfection; and thus what Jacob gave was good current money; (Calmet) or such things as were received among merchants.'

(Menochius) --- Men and women used them likewise, as phylacteries or talismans, to which many superstitious virtues were attributed. (St. Augustine, ep. 73[245?], ad Posid. 9, iii. in Gen.; Ezechiel xvi. 12; Proverbs xxv.; Exodus xxxv.; Judges viii.) (Calmet) --- <i>The turpentine tree</i>; or "an oak tree," as the Hebrew <i>haela</i> means also. Septuagint adds, "and he destroyed them till this present day;" which seems intended to refute the story of their being found and adored by the Samaritans, or employed by Solomon when he built the temple. Jacob buried them privately. (Calmet) See Deuteronomy vii. 5.'
      v:005:
        - 'GEN:35:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Terror of God.</i> A panic fear, which the pagans thought was sent by Pan. (Calmet) --- God can easily make the most powerful flee before a few. (St. Augustine, q. 112.)'
      v:006:
        - 'GEN:35:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Chanaan,</i> to distinguish it from another. Judges i. 26, (Menochius) or because Moses wrote this in Arabia. (Calmet)'

        - 'GEN:35:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>To him.</i> Hebrew literally, "He called that place the God of Bethel, because there God (<i>or</i> the angels) appeared to him." <i>Haelohim,</i> with a verb plural, generally refers to angels; when it is applied to God, the article is omitted, and the verb is singular. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - "GEN:35:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Debora.</i> The Rabbin say she had been sent to urge Jacob's return. (Menochius) --- Perhaps she was come to see him and the daughters of Laban, for whom she would naturally have a great regard, as she lived with Laban. --- <i>Weeping.</i> This shews the great respect they had for this good old servant. (Haydock)"
      v:010:
        - 'GEN:35:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Israel.</i> This name signifies one that prevaileth with God; (Challoner) and is more honourable and expressive than that of Jacob. God confirms what had been declared by his angel, chap. xxxii. 28.'
      v:012:

      v:016:
        - 'GEN:35:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Spring.</i> Hebrew, cibrath. Septuagint leave it untranslated, Chalratha, though they render it horse-race, (Ver. 19.) and join both together, chap. xlviii. 7. The word occurs again, 4 Kings v. 19; and St. Jerome translates it the spring, or the finest time of the earth. Others suppose it signifies the high road, (Ver. 19.) or horse-course, or a mile, &c. as if the place, where Rachel died, and not the season of the year, were designated. Calmet concludes, she died about the distance of an acre (<i>sillon,</i> furrow or ridge) from Ephrata. But there seems to be no reason why we should recede from the Vulgate. (Haydock)'

(Calmet) Jacob chooses to give his son a more auspicious name; as the other would have reminded him too sensibly of his loss. (Haydock)'

        - 'GEN:35:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Tower.</i> Hebrew, Heder, about a mile to the east of Bethlehem, where the angels appeared to announce the birth of Christ. St. Helen built a temple there in honour of the angels. (Tirinus) --- Shepherds had such places to keep watch. (Calmet) --- There was a tower of this name near Jerusalem. (Micheas iv. 8; St. Jerome, q. His.)'
      v:022:
        - 'GEN:35:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>The concubine.</i> She was his lawful wife; but according to the style of the Hebrews, is called <i>concubine,</i> because of her servile extraction. (Challoner) --- <i>Ignorant of;</i> and therefore, to mark his displeasure, he deprived him of the birth-right, chap. xlix. 4. Jacob approached no more to Bala, as David had no farther commerce with the wives whom Absalom had defiled, 2 Kings xvi. 22. (Menochius) --- The Septuagint add, and it appeared evil in his sight; an omission which the Hebrew editions seem to acknowledge, by leaving a vacant space. (Kennicott)'

He was one of the brightest figures of Jesus Christ, on account of his miraculous birth, name, willingness to be sacrificed, marriage with a woman sought at a great distance, &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Esau,</i> who had always shewn a great regard for his father, joins his brother in rendering to him the last rites of burial. (Haydock) --- Rebecca was probably dead. (Menochius) --- The death of Isaac is mentioned out of its place, that the history of Joseph may not be interrupted, as it happened when Joseph was in prison, in the year of the world 2288. (Calmet)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "GEN:36:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Edom.</i> His genealogy extends as far as ver. 20, where that of Seir, the Horrite, begins. The seven first verses specify Esau's sons, the twelve next his grandsons born in Seir. From the 15th to the 20th verse, we have the most ancient form of government in that nation under the <i>Aluphim,</i> or heads of families. To them succeed <i>kings,</i> (ver. 31 to 40,) and then <i>dukes</i> to the end. Moses omits several generations of Oolibama's grand-children, as foreign to his purpose, which was to shew the Israelites whom they were not to molest. The <i>kings,</i> of whom he speaks, (ver. 31,) might govern different parts of the country at the same time; and that before any form of government was established among the Hebrews, as it was under Moses, who is styled a king, (Deuteronomy xxxiii. 5,) about 200 years after Esau had driven the Horrites from their mountains. (Calmet) --- Among these nations several good men might exist, as Job, &c. But the true religion was preserved more fully among the 12 tribes. (St. Augustine, City of God xv. xvi.) (Worthington)"
      v:002:
        - 'GEN:36:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Ada.</i> These wives of Esau are called by other names, chap. xxvi. But it was very common amongst the ancients for the same persons to have two names, as Esau himself was also called Edom. (Challoner) --- <i>Ana the daughter of Sebeon</i>. It is not certain that Ana was a woman. The Samaritan and Septuagint make him son of Sebeon, both here and ver. 14, (Haydock) as well as some Latin copies; and he is mentioned as such, ver. 24. The <i>daughter</i> of Sebeon may, therefore, designate his grand-daughter, which is not unusual. Sebeon is called <i>Hevite, Hethite,</i> and <i>Horrite,</i> on account of his dwelling in different countries; though some think they were different persons. (Calmet) --- This, and innumerable other difficulties, may convince Protestants that the Scriptures are not easy. (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - 'GEN:36:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Eliphaz;</i> perphas the Themanite, and friend of Job, (St. Jerome) or his grandfather, by Theman; as Job was the grandson of Esau, and the second king, ver. 33. (Tirinus)'

(Zach. v. 2.[Zacharias ix. 7.?; Micheas v. 2.?]) The Rabbin assert they wore not a crown, as the kings did. (Calmet) --- Both obtained their authority by election. An aristocracy prevailed under the dukes. (Menochius)'

The Septuagint and ancient versions retain the original word. It is used for a body of water. (Calmet)'

      v:031:
        - 'GEN:36:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>A king.</i> See ver. 1. Moses might also add this with reference to the times, when he knew the Hebrews would petition for a king, for whom he gave particular laws. (Menochius) --- These kings were probably foreigners, who subdued the natives. They did not obtain the kingdom by succession. (Calmet)'
      v:033:
        - 'GEN:36:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Jobab.</i> Most people suppose this is Job, the model of patience. (Menochius) --- <i>Bosra,</i> or Bezer, was the capital of Idumea, in the tribe of Ruben. (Calmet)'

      v:043:
        - "GEN:36:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>The same</i> Edom <i>is Esau.</i> Moses seems particularly attentive to assert both titles for the same person, ver. 8, &c. The time of Esau's death cannot be ascertained. There is reason to hope that he died penitent; though in the early part of his life, he gave way to his ferocious temper, and became a figure of the reprobate. He lived on terms of friendship with his brother, assisted him to bury his father, &c. (Calmet) --- He was a hunter, indeed; which St. Jerome looks upon as a bad sign: \"<em>nunquam venatorem in bonam partem legi</em>,\" in Micheas v. But this was also in his younger days.

      v:001:
        - GEN:37:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Sojourned</i> at Hebron and the environs. (Haydock)
      v:002:
        - 'GEN:37:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Generations.</i> This connects his history with chap. xxxv. What happened to Jacob and his sons, and particularly to Joseph, forms the subject of the remaining part of Genesis. (Haydock) --- <i>Old;</i> complete, or beginning "his 17th year," as the Hebrew, Chaldean, and Septuagint have it. "He was the son or boy of"---so many years always means the current year unfinished. (Bochart 1. R. xiii. 1.) --- <i>The sons.</i> Perhaps these were not so much enraged against Joseph, till he told his father of their scandalous behaviour, in order that he might put a stop to it. --- <i>He accused.</i> Some editions of the Septuagint read, "they accused him," &c.; but all others confirm the Vulgate and Hebrew. (Calmet) --- <i>Crime:</i> perhaps of sodomy, or bestiality (St. Thomas Aquinas); or of abusive language to Joseph himself. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'GEN:37:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Old age,</i> and therefore expected to have no more children; but he loved him still more, on account of his innocent and sweet behaviour (Menochius): in which sense the Samaritan, Chaldean, &c., have, "because he was a wise and prudent boy." --- <i>Colours.</i> The nations of the East delight in gaudy attire, "hanging down to the heels" as the original <i>passim</i> is sometimes expressed, <i>talaris & polymita,</i> ver. 3. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - 'GEN:37:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Could not,</i> through envy, which caused them to notice every little distinction shewn to Joseph. They perceived he was the most beloved. His accusing them, and insinuating by his mysterious dreams that he would be their lord, heightened their rage. (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - 'GEN:37:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>A dream.</i> These dreams of Joseph were <i>prophetical,</i> and sent from God, as were also those which he interpreted, chap. xl. and xli.; otherwise, generally speaking, the observing of dreams is condemned in the Scripture, as superstitious and sinful. See Deuteronomy xviii. 10, and Ecclesiasticus xxxiv. 2, 3.'
      v:007:
        - 'GEN:37:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Sheaf.</i> Joseph probably knew not what this portended, as the prophets were sometimes ignorant of the real purport of their visions. (Calmet) --- But it admirably foreshewed the famine, which would bring his brethren to adore him in Egypt. (Menochius)'
      v:009:
        - 'GEN:37:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>The sun.</i> This second dream confirmed the truth of the former. Joseph relates it with simplicity, not suspecting the ill will of his brethren: but his father easily perceives what effect the narration would have, and desires him to be more cautious. He even points out the apparent incoherence of the dream, as Rachel, who seemed intended by the <i>moon,</i> was already dead; unless this dream happened before that event. St. Augustine (q. 123.) observes, this was never literally verified in Joseph, but it was in Jesus Christ, whom he prefigured. (Calmet) --- Some think that Bala, the nurse of Joseph, was intended by the moon. (Tirinus)'
      v:010:
        - 'GEN:37:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Worship.</i> This word is not used here to signify <i>divine worship,</i> but an <i>inferior veneration,</i> expressed by the bowing of the body, and that, according to the manner of the eastern nations, down to the ground.'
      v:011:
        - GEN:37:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>With himself:</i> not doubting but it was prophetical. Thus acted the Blessed Virgin Mary. (Calmet)
      v:013:
        - 'GEN:37:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>In Sichem.</i> About ninety miles off. The town had not probably been as yet rebuilt. Jacob had a field there, and the country was free for any one to feed their flocks. It was customary to drive them to a distance. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'GEN:37:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Bring me.</i> He was afraid of letting him remain with them, and retained him mostly at home for company, and to protect him from danger.'
      v:016:
        - "GEN:37:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>My brethren.</i> The man was acquainted with Jacob's family, as he had dwelt in those parts for a long time. (Haydock)"
      v:017:
        - GEN:37:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Dothain:</i> twelve miles to the north of Samaria. (Eusebius)
      v:019:
        - 'GEN:37:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>The dreamer.</i> Hebrew <i>Bahal hachalomoth,</i> "the lord of dreams," or the visionary lord (Calmet); or one who feigns dreams: so the Jews say of our Saviour, <i>this seducer.</i> (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'GEN:37:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Pit:</i> walled around to contain water: Hebrew <i>Bur.</i> <i>Bar</i> means a well that has no walls. (Menochius) --- <i>Shall appear.</i> They resolve to tell a lie, and easily believe that Joseph had been as bad as themselves in telling one first. If they had believed the dreams were from God, they would hardly have supposed that they could prevent them from having their effect. (Haydock)'
      v:022:
        - "GEN:37:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>His father.</i> Ruben wished to regain his father's favour, chap. xxxv. 22."
      v:025:
        - 'GEN:37:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>To eat bread.</i> How could they do this while their innocent brother was praying and lamenting! (chap. xlii. 21.) (Haydock) --- <i>Some:</i> a caravan of merchants. (Du Hamel) --- <i>Balm,</i> or rosin; "that of Syria resembles attic honey." (Pliny, Natural History) --- <i>Myrrh,</i> (stacten); Hebrew, <i>Lot:</i> "drops of myrrh or laudanum, or of the Lotus tree." (Calmet)'
      v:028:
        - 'GEN:37:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Of silver.</i> Some have read, thirty pieces of gold or silver. (St. Ambrose, c. 3.) --- The price was trifling: twenty sicles would be about £2 5s. 7½d. English. The Madianites and Ismaelites jointly purchased Joseph. (Haydock)'
      v:029:
        - 'GEN:37:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Ruben,</i> who, in the mean time, had been absent while his brethren hearkened to the proposal of Juda only, and therefore consented to this evil. (Haydock)'
      v:030:
        - 'GEN:37:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>I go</i> to seek for him. His brethren inform him of what they had done, and he consents to keep it a secret from his father. (Menochius)'
      v:033:
        - 'GEN:37:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>A beast.</i> So he might reasonably conclude from the blood, and from the insinuations of the messengers sent by his ten sons, (Haydock) whom he would not suspect of so heinous a crime. Wild beasts infested that country. (Menochius)'
      v:034:
        - 'GEN:37:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Sack-cloth,</i> or hair-cloth, <i>cilicio.</i> These garments were made very close, like a sack, of the hair taken from the goats of Cilicia, which grew long, rough, and of a dark colour. The poorest people used them: <i>Usum in Castrorum & miseris velamina nautis,</i> (Virgil, Geor. 3.); and the Ascetics, or monks, afterwards chose them for the sake of mortification and humility. (Calmet) --- Jacob was the first, mentioned in Scripture, who put them on, and the Israelites imitated him in their mourning. --- <i>Long time;</i> twenty-three years, till he heard of his son being still alive. (Menochius)'
      v:035:
        - 'GEN:37:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Into hell;</i> that is, into <i>limbo,</i> the place where the souls of the just were received before the death of our Redeemer. For allowing that the word <i>hell</i> sometimes is taken for the <i>grave,</i> it cannot be so taken in this place; since Jacob did not believe his son to be in the <i>grave,</i> (whom he supposed to be devoured by a wild beast) and therefore could not mean to go down to him thither: but certainly meant the place of rest, where he believed his soul to be. (Challoner) --- <i>Soal,</i> or sheol, <i>to crave,</i> denotes the receptacle of the dead, (Leigh) or a lower region; the grave for the body; <i>limbo,</i> or <i>hell,</i> when speaking of the soul. See Delrio, Adag. in 2 Kings, p. 209. (Haydock) --- Protestants here translate it, "the grave," being unwilling to admit a third place in the other world for the soul. See the contrary in St. Augustine, ep. 99[164?], ad Evod.; City of God xx. 15. (Worthington)'
      v:036:
        - 'GEN:37:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>An eunuch.</i> This word sometimes signifies a <i>chamberlain, courtier,</i> or <i>officer</i> of the king: and so it is taken in this place. (Challoner) --- <i>Soldiers,</i> cooks, or butchers. Hebrew <i>tabachim,</i> executioners, <i>mactantium.</i> He might also be chief sacrificer, governor of the prisons, &c., all these employments were anciently very honourable, Daniel ii. 14. The providence of God never shines more brightly in any part of the Scripture, than in this history of Joseph, except in that of Jesus Christ, of whom Joseph was a beautiful figure. He was born when his father was grown old, as Jesus was in the last age of the world; he was <i>a son increasing,</i> as Jesus <i>waxed in age and grace before God and men;</i> both were beloved by their father, both comely, &c. (Calmet)'

      v:001:
        - "GEN:38:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>At that time Juda,</i> twenty years old, marries the daughter of Sue, and has three sons by her during the three following years. The first takes Thamar to wife, when he was seventeen. Onan marries her the next year; after which, she remains a widow about three years, when she bears twins to Juda. Phares goes down with him into Egypt, and has children there during Jacob's life. On this account, they are numbered among those who went down with Jacob, (chap. xlvi. 12,) as the children of Benjamin seem to be likewise. Thus all these events might happen during the twenty-three years that Jacob dwelt in Chanaan, and the seventeen that he sojourned in Egypt. Some have thought the time too short, and have concluded that Juda had been married long before Joseph's slavery. He was, however, only four years older. (Calmet)"

        - 'GEN:38:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Sela.</i> Juda gave the name of Her to his first-born, as the Hebrew shews. His wife gave names to the two latter. --- <i>Ceased;</i> Hebrew <i>casbi:</i> "she died in bearing him," as Aquila has it. Most commentators take the word for the name of a place mentioned, Josue xv. 44. "He (Juda) was at Casbi when she bare him."'
      v:007:
        - 'GEN:38:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Wicked;</i> without shame or remorse, sinning against nature, in order, if we may believe the Jews, that the beauty of his wife might not be impaired by having children. Onan was actuated by envy. (Menochius)'
      v:008:
        - 'GEN:38:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Wife.</i> This was then customary among the Chanaanites, as Philo insinuates. It also continued to be practised in Egypt, till the year of Christ 491 at least, when the marriage had not been consummated. Moses established it as a law, when no issue had sprung from the deceased brother. (Calmet) (Deuteronomy xxv. 5.) The eldest son bore his name; the rest were called after their own father. This law is now abrogated; and the prohibition, which has been issued by the Church, can be dispensed with only by herself, (Worthington) as was the case in the marriage of Henry VIII, with Catherine, the virgin relict of his brother Arthur. (Haydock)'

      v:014:
        - 'GEN:38:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Veil;</i> (theristrum) a long robe, covering the whole body, except the eyes. Thus she was <i>disguised;</i> or, as it were, masked, as Aquila translates. Harlots herein imitated modest women, chap. xxiv. 65. --- <i>Cross way.</i> Hebrew <i>Henayim</i>, which the Septuagint and Syriac take for a proper name. Others translate "at the gate of the eyes," which means two roads, where a person must open his eyes to judge which is the right one---or "at the gate of the two fountains leading to Thamnas," Judges xiv. 1. Prostitutes formerly infested the high roads. (Jeremias iii. 2; Ezechiel xvi. 25.) Chrysippus says, "at first harlots remained out of the city, and covered their faces; but afterwards growing more hardened, they laid aside the mask," &c.'
      v:018:

(Calmet) --- Juda might blame himself for exposing these valuable things, and divesting himself of all his dignity, to gratify his unjustifiable passion. If some have excused both the parties concerned, the Scripture at least sufficiently shews in what light we ought to consider their conduct. Juda himself thought her worthy of death; though in some sense, she was <i>juster</i> than himself, ver. 24, 26. (Haydock) --- She was guilty of a sort of adultery, being engaged to Sela; and also of incest, &c.; whereas the fault of Juda, through ignorance of her person, was simply fornication; which is, however, always contrary to the law of nature, as the pagans themselves confessed. (Grotius in Matthew v.) (Calmet) --- From Christ's choosing to be born of such progenitors, we may learn to adore his humility and tender regard for sinners. (Haydock)"

If she was to die, before she was delivered, God prevented the cruel sentence from taking effect. (Haydock) --- Many nations have punished adultery with fire. Macrinus, the Roman emperor, ordered the culprits to be tied together and thrown into the flames. (Capitolin.) --- Moses commanded the daughters of priests, who should be detected in this crime, to be given to the flames, (Leviticus xxi. 9,) and others to be stoned; (Leviticus xx. 10,) whence the Rabbin have concluded, that Thamar was a priest's daughter. (Calmet)"
      v:026:
        - "GEN:38:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Juster.</i> For Juda had been guilty of injustice; and had thus exposed her to the danger of following a life of lewdness. (Haydock) --- She remained a widow afterwards, as she was now rendered unfit to be married either to Juda or Sela. The latter married another woman, Numbers xxvi. 19. (Calmet) --- While Juda was engaged in this unlawful commerce, and yielded to the temptation, Joseph was triumphing over a much greater temptation, in rejecting the solicitations of his master's wife. (Haydock)"

These two brothers were a type of the vocation of the Gentiles, and of the reprobation of the Jews, who lost the privileges to which they thought themselves entitled. (St. Irenæus iv. 42; St. Chrysostom; &c.) (Calmet) --- Phares was the ancestor of Jesus Christ, St. Matthew i. 3.'

        - 'GEN:40:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Doth not interpretation belong to God?</i> When dreams are from God, as these were, the interpretation of them is a gift of God. But the generality of dreams are not of this sort; but either proceed from the natural complexions and dispositions of persons, or the roving of their imaginations in the day on such objects as they are much affected with, or from their mind being disturbed with cares and troubles, and oppressed with bodily infirmities: or they are suggested by evil spirits, to flatter, or to terrify weak minds; in order to gain belief, and so draw them into error or superstition; or at least to trouble them in their sleep, whom they cannot move while they are awake: so that the general rule, with regard to dreams, is not to observe them, nor to give any credit to them. (Challoner) --- Physicians indeed, sometimes form some judgment of the nature of a distemper from dreams; on which subject, Hippocrates and Galen have written. But to pretend to discover by them the future actions of free agents, would be superstitious, Deuteronomy xviii. 10.

God was pleased that Jacob should remain so long ignorant of his son's fate, that, by sorrow, he might do penance, and purify himself from every stain; and that he might not attempt to redeem Joseph, whose slavery was to be the source of so much good to his family. (Menochius) --- Joseph did not make himself known at first; in order to bring his brethren to a true sense of their duty, that they might obtain pardon for their sin. Thus pastors must sometimes treat their penitents with a degree of severity. (St. Gregory, hom. 22, Ezec.; St. Augustine, ser. 82, de Tem.) (Worthington)"

(Challoner) --- Aquila translates "vagrants" going from place to place, as if to discover the weakest parts. Joseph was a person in authority. It was his duty to guard against invasion. He knew how his brethren had treated Sichem, and how they had behaved to himself; and though he might not suppose, that they had any evil design upon Egypt, yet he had a right to make them give an account of themselves.

Joseph dealt in this manner with his brethren, to bring them by the means of affliction to a sense of their former sin, and a sincere repentance for it.'

      v:036:
        - 'GEN:42:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Without.</i> Through excess of grief, Jacob speaks with a degree of exaggeration; or he thought his children were now taken from him so fast, that he would soon have none left.'

It is like balm; thick, odoriferous, and medicinal. --- <i>Myrrh,</i> (stactes); Hebrew <i>Lot.</i> A liquor stamped from fresh myrrh pilled, with a little water. (Calmet) --- Sometimes it is translated <i>Gutta,</i> a drop. (Psalm xliv. 9.) (Menochius) --- <i>Turpentine.</i> St. Jerome and the Septuagint seem to have read <i>Bothmin</i> instead of the present Hebrew <i>Batenim,</i> which some translate, "nuts of the pistacium," (Bochart); which hand in clusters, and are of an oblong shape. Vitellius first brought them out of Syria. (Pliny, Natural History xv. 22.) --- <i>Almonds;</i> Septuagint <i>nuts,</i> of which almonds are one species. (Menochius)'

If idolatry was then common in Egypt, as Calmet supposes, in opposition to Grotius, Joseph did not participate at least in that impiety. --- <i>At noon.</i> This was the time for the chief meal in Egypt. The Hebrews generally took something at this time, and again in the evening. To eat before noon was esteemed a mark of intemperance. (Ecclesiastes x. 16; Acts ii. 15.) Plato thought the people of Italy, who eat two full meals in the day, would never be eminent for wisdom or for prudence. (Athen. iv. 10.) (Calmet)'

Herodotus, ii. 41, says, they would not use a knife which had been in the hands of a Greek, nor kiss him. This aversion arose, from their custom of abstaining from various meats which other nations eat. (Chaldean; &c.) They disliked the Hebrews, because they were also <i>shepherds,</i> chap. xlvi. 34 (Calmet); and because they knew they were accustomed to eat goats, oxen, and sheep, the objects of adoration in Egypt, (Exodus viii. 26): though they were not, probably, served upon Joseph's table. (Tirinus) --- They who dwelt in the towns could not bear even the Egyptian shepherds, because they were of a more stirring and warlike temper. (Calmet) (Cunæus)"
      v:033:
        - 'GEN:43:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>They sat.</i> This posture is more ancient than that of lying down at table. The Hebrews adopted the latter, from the Persians, during the captivity, Esther i. 6, and vii. 8. --- We have at least no earlier vestige of this custom in Scripture. (Calmet) --- <i>Very much:</i> as they were placed in that order by the steward. They knew not how he could so exactly discover who was born first, as there was so short an interval between the births of many of them. (Haydock)'

So Hector reproaches Diomed for fleeing before him, though he was placed in the highest place at table among the Greeks, and had the largest portion both of meat and drink. --- <i>Merry.</i> <i>Inebriati sunt,</i> sometimes means intoxicated: but it is not at all probably that Joseph's brethren would indulge in any such excess, while they knew him not, (Calmet) and were under the impressions of fear and wonder. They took what was sufficient, and even decently abundant, with thankfulness for so unexpected an honour. (Haydock) --- The word is often taken in this sense, as at the feast of Cana, where Jesus would never have furnished such an abundance of wine for people already drunk. (John ii. 10; Proverbs xi. 24[25?].) Homer's feasts consist in every man taking what he pleased. (Calmet)"

(Challoner) --- St. Thomas Aquinas, 2, 2, q. 195, a. 7. Hebrew may be translated without attending to the points, "Is not this the cup, out of which my lord drinketh; and he has augured, <i>or</i> discovered, by it the evil which you have committed." Pliny (Natural History xxx. 2.) mentions a method of divining, by means of water in a basin. (Calmet) --- The Egyptians probably supposed, that Joseph used some means to disclose what was hidden; and he alludes, in jest, to their foolish notion. (Haydock) --- He had a right to afflict his guilty brethren; and as for Benjamin, who was innocent, he made him ample recompense for this transitory terror. Some think that the steward said, <i>in which he is wont to divine,</i> unauthorized by his master. (Menochius)'

        - 'GEN:44:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Sentence.</i> It is but just; yet I shall only insist on the detention of the culprit.

He might wish also to keep his younger brother out of danger, in case they were inclined to persecute him. (Haydock)'

See Manetho ap. Eusebius, Præp. x. 13. Another reason why they hated foreigners was, because they slew and eat sheep, &c., which they themselves adored. The Egyptians kept sheep for this purpose, and for the benefits to be derived from their wool, &c., chap. xlvii. 17. (Calmet) --- Joseph took advantage of this disposition of the inhabitants, to keep his brethren at a distance from them, that they might not be perverted. He does not introduce them at court, that no jealousy might be excited. He shews that he is not ashamed of his extraction. (Menochius)'

      v:031:
        - "GEN:47:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>To the bed's head.</i> St. Paul, (Hebrews xi. 21,) following the Greek translation of the Septuagint, reads <i>adored the top of his rod.</i> Where note, that the same word in the Hebrew, according to the different pointing of it, signifies both a <i>bed</i> and a <i>rod.</i> And to verify both these sentences, we must understand that Jacob, leaning on Joseph's rod, adored, turning towards the head of his bed: which adoration, inasmuch as it was referred to God, was an absolute, and sovereign worship: but inasmuch as it was referred to the rod of Joseph, as a figure of the sceptre, that is, of the royal dignity of Christ, was only an inferior and relative honour. (Challoner) --- St. Augustine proposes another very probable explanation. He adored God, supporting himself on the top of his staff, or of Joseph's sceptre, q. 162. The Septuagint and Syriac intimate, that Jacob bowed down respectfully towards the sceptre of his son, and thus complied with the explication which he had given to his dream, chap. xxxvii. 10. Others, who understood the Hebrew <i>Hamitta</i>, in the sense given to it by St. Jerome, Aquila, and Symmachus, suppose that after he had given his last instructions to Joseph in a sitting posture, growing weaker, he laid his head again upon his pillow. (Calmet) --- God was pleased to have this recorded in a language subject to such various interpretations; as he, perhaps, would have us to understand, that Jacob literally bowed down both to the bed-head and to the top of the sceptre. For many believe, that the Scripture has often several literal meanings. (Tirinus) --- If the Massoretic points had been known to the Septuagint, we should not have had this variation. But the learned generally agree, that they are of human, and even of very modern invention."

      v:015: 'GEN:47:15 | 15 | 15 | And when the buyers wanted money, all Egypt came to Joseph, saying: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Give us bread: why should we die in thy presence, having now no money?'
      v:016: 'GEN:47:16 | 16 | 16 | And he answered them: Bring me your cattle, and for them I will give you food, if you have no money.'
      v:017: 'GEN:47:17 | 17 | 17 | And when they had brought them, he gave them food in exchange for their horses, and sheep, and oxen, and asses: and he maintained them that year for the exchange of their cattle.'
      v:018: 'GEN:47:18 | 18 | 18 | And they came the second year, and said to him: We will not hide from our lord, how that our money is spent, and our cattle also are gone: neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left but our bodies and our lands.'
      v:019: "GEN:47:19 | 19 | 19 | Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes? we will be thine, both we and our lands: buy us to be the king's servants, and give us seed, lest for want of tillers the land be turned into a wilderness."
      v:020: "GEN:47:20 | 20 | 20 | So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, every man selling his possessions, because of the greatness of the famine. And he brought it into Pharao's hands:"

      v:022: 'GEN:47:22 | 22 | 22 | Except the land of the priests, which had been given them by the king: to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the public stores, and therefore they were not forced to sell their possessions.'
      v:023: 'GEN:47:23 | 23 | 23 | Then Joseph said to the people : Behold, as you see, both you and your lands belong to Pharao; take seed and sow the fields,'
      v:024: 'GEN:47:24 | 24 | 24 | That you may have corn. The fifth part you shall give to the king; the other four you shall have for seed, and for food for your families and children.'
      v:025: 'GEN:47:25 | 25 | 25 | And they answered: Our life is in thy hand; only let my lord look favourably upon us, and we will gladly serve the king.'

I was in a manner forced to bury her there, by the heat of the weather, (Menochius) and the confusion to which my family was then exposed, on account of the slaughter of the Sichemites.

(Menochius) --- The custom of imposing hands on a person, is of high antiquity, and is still practised in the Christian church in the ordination of her ministers. (Numbers viii. 10; Acts vi. 6.) See Matthew xix. 13; Numbers xxvii. 23. (Calmet) --- The cross of Christ is the source of all our exaltation.

It is not probable that he, who was called God before, should now be styled an angel, as some Protestants would have us believe. (Haydock) --- St. Basil (contra Eunom. iii.) and St. Chrysostom, with many others, allege this text, to prove that an angel is given to man for the direction of his life, and to protect him against the assaults of the rebel angels, as Calvin himself dares not deny. --- <i>Let my,</i> &c. Let them partake of the blessings (promised by name to me, to Abraham, and to Isaac) among the other tribes; or, may God bless them, in consideration of his servants.

(Masius.) --- The particulars of this transaction are not given in Scripture. (Menochius) --- The children of Joseph buried their father in this field, Josue xxiv. 32. There also was Jacob's well, John iv. 5. We have already observed, that Jacob restored whatever his sons had taken unjustly from the unhappy Sichemites, chap. xxxiv. 30. --- <i>Sword and bow,</i> is understood by St. Jerome and Onkelos in a spiritual sense, to denote his justice and earnest prayer, by which he merited the divine protection; (Calmet) or it may mean the money, which he had procured with hard labour.

        - 'GEN:49:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Last.</i> Hebrew, "future days." It was an ancient and commendable custom, for parents to assemble their children in their last moments, to give them salutary instructions. They often also foretold to them what should happen. See Deuteronomy xxxi; Josue xxiv; 1 Kings xii; Tobias iv. 3; 1 Machabees ii. Cyrus and Socrates both believed that they had then an insight into futurity. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - "GEN:49:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>My strength,</i> &c. He calls him his <i>strength,</i> as being born whilst his father was in his full strength and vigour: he calls him <i>the beginning of his sorrow,</i> because <i>cares</i> and <i>sorrows</i> usually come on with the birth of children. --- <i>Excelling in gifts,</i> &c., because the first-born had a title to a <i>double portion,</i> and to have the command over his brethren, which Ruben forfeited by his sin; being <i>poured out as water;</i> that is, spilt and lost. (Challoner) --- <i>In command.</i> He ought to have succeeded to his father in authority. But Joseph entered in upon his rejection, 1 Paralipomenon v. 1. The priesthood was given to Levi's descendants; and the regal power, partly to those of Joseph, who reigned over the ten tribes, for a long time; and partly to the posterity of Juda, who exercised dominion over all the people of Israel. (Chaldee) (Worthington)"
      v:004:
        - 'GEN:49:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Grow thou not.</i> This was not meant by way of a curse or imprecation; but by way of a prophecy, foretelling that the tribe of Ruben should not inherit the pre-eminences usually annexed to the first birth-right, viz., the double portion, the being prince or lord over the other brethren, and the priesthood: of which the double portion was given to Joseph, the princely office to Juda, and the priesthood to Levi. (Challoner) --- Thou hast abandoned thyself to thy brutal passion; do so no more, <i>ne adjicias.</i> (St. Jerome, q. Heb.) <i>Let Ruben live, and die not; let him be small in number,</i> Deuteronomy xxxiii. 6. His tribe never became very considerable. (Calmet) --- <i>Couch.</i> See chap xxxv. 22. Eternal infamy attends the name of Ruben. (Haydock)'

      v:006:
        - 'GEN:49:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Slew a man,</i> viz., Sichem, the son of Hemor, with all his people, chap. xxxiv. Mystically and prophetically it alludes to Christ; whom their posterity, viz., the priests and the scribes, put to death. (Challoner) --- <i>A wall,</i> Sichem, which they destroyed: or, according to the Septuagint, "they ham-strung" <i>a bull,</i> as the same Hebrew word signifies; both which may refer to the prince of the town, or to Joseph, (Calmet) in whose persecution these two were principally concerned. Jacob declares, he had no share in their attack upon the people of Sichem: his <i>soul,</i> or his <i>glory,</i> was not impaired by their misconduct. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - "GEN:49:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Scatter them.</i> Levi had no division allotted to him, but only some cities among the other tribes; and Simeon had only a part of Juda's lot, which was so small, that his descendants were forced to seek for a fresh establishment; some in Gader, others in Mount Seir. (1 Paralipomenon iv. 39; Josue xi. 2.) Simeon alone was not blessed by Moses, Deuteronomy xxxiii. (Du Hamel) --- The Levites obtained a blessing, on account of their distinguished zeal; (Numbers xxv.) while Zambri rivets, as it were, the curse upon the family of Simeon. (Menochius)"

        - 'GEN:49:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Praise.</i> He alludes to his name, his martial prowess, and dominion over all his <i>brethren;</i> who should be all called Jews, and submit to his sway. Some explain all this of Jesus Christ; others refer the first part of the prophecy to Juda. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - "GEN:49:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>A lion's whelp,</i> &c. This blessing of Juda foretelleth the strength of his tribe, the fertility of his inheritance, and principally that the sceptre, and legislative power, should not be utterly taken away from his race till about the time of the coming of Christ: as in effect it never was: which is a demonstration against the modern Jews, that the Messias is long since come; for the sceptre has long since been utterly taken away from Juda. (Challoner) --- This none can deny. Juda is compared to <i>a lion,</i> which was the emblem of his royal dignity, and was borne in the standards of that tribe. --- <i>To the prey.</i> Hebrew, \"from the prey.\" He proceeds from victory to victory. He <i>couches,</i> ready to fall upon his prey; and, retiring to the mountains, is still eager to renew the attack. (Calmet) --- Read the history of David and of Solomon, who, both in peace and war, were a terror to the surrounding nations."
      v:010:
        - "GEN:49:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>The sceptre.</i> Almost every word in this verse has been explained in a different manner. But all the ancient Jews agree with Christians, that it contains a prediction of the Messias, and points out the period of his coming. Whether this was verified when Herod, a foreigner, got possession of the throne, and was acknowledged by the Jews, just about the time of our Saviour's nativity, as most of the fathers suppose; or it only took its full effect when Agrippa II lost all his power, the temple and the city were laid in ruins, and the whole nation dispersed for ever, it is not perhaps so easy to determine. In either supposition, the Messias has long since come. Jacob foretels, either that Christ would make his appearance as soon as the Jews should fall under a foreign yoke, and in this sense he was born about the 37th year of Herod the great --- or he should come just before the kingdom of Juda should have an end, which took place in the 70th year of the Christian era, or about 37 years after the public appearance and death of our Saviour. <i>The sceptre shall not depart</i> irrevocably from the Jews; over whom the tribe of Juda had always the greatest authority in appointing the princes, when they were not selected from the tribe itself, or <i>from his thigh; till the Messias,</i> who has been expected so long, shall come and gather <i>all nations</i> into his Church. Then the designs of Providence, in watching over the Jews, being accomplished, their republic shall be dissolved, because they have shed his <i>blood,</i> instead of acknowledging his celestial beauty, ver. 12. The evident signs of decay in the kingdom of the Jews, were sufficient to excite the attention of all to look for the Messias; and we read, both in St. John iv. 25, in Tacitus, and Suetorius, that his appearance was fully expected about that time. The <i>sceptre</i> is the emblem of sovereign, though not always independent, power. Juda and his posterity were always at the head of their brethren. They marched first in the wilderness; two of the judges were of this tribe. But their chief glory began with David, whose posterity the whole nation obeyed, till Jeroboam tore away the ten tribes. Still the tribe of Benjamin and the Levites adhered to Juda. During the captivity, there were judges admitted to superintend over their brethren; and King Joakim was raised to high authority. The rulers who came into power after the return of the Jews, were either of this tribe, at least by the mother's side, or were chosen and recognized by the tribe of Juda. Even Herod, in this sense, might be considered as a Jewish king, though a foreigner, as well as a Thracian might be counted a Roman emperor, without any diminution of the imperial authority of Rome. Perhaps indeed he was an usurper, till the nation acknowledged his authority two years after the birth of Christ. (Philo, de Temp. ii; Josephus, Antiquities xvii. 3.) \"Herod was the first foreign king admitted by the Jews.\" (St. Augustine, City of God xviii. 45.) If, therefore, no stranger was to be acknowledged by the nation, till He came, who was to establish a spiritual and everlasting kingdom, the moment was arrived, when the Jews submitted to Herod, and Christ had actually been born two years. --- <i>From Juda,</i> or from that tribe; for Jacob gave peculiar blessings to each; (ver. 28,) and hence the fathers gather, that the Messias should spring from Juda. --- <i>Ruler from his thigh,</i> lineally descended from him, or acknowledged at least by his posterity, as all the legal princes were till the coming of Christ. --- <i>Mechokek</i> might also signify a teacher or scribe expounding the law of Moses, which subsisted for the same period; but this is more probably a farther explication of the <i>sceptre,</i> &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Till had ci,</i> which words being joined together, are always taken in this sense. (Helvicus.) --- <i>Sent. Schiloach</i> (or <em>Ssolu</em>é) seems to have been in St. Jerome's copy, though we now read <i>Shiloh</i> (or <i>Ssole</i>) \"to whom\" the authority belongs; Septuagint, \"to whom all things are reserved; <i>or</i> till the things arrive, which are laid up for him. (Calmet) --- <i>Expectation,</i> or congregation of <i>nations,</i> as Aggeus afterwards foretold, ii. 8. If we examine all the plausible explications which have been given to this verse, we shall find that they all tend to convey the same truth. \"The sceptre (shebet, rod, crook, power or tribe) shall not depart (cease, be taken off) from Juda, (the tribe or the Jews) nor a leader (scribe, lawyer, or legislator) from his thigh, (between his feet, or from his banners) till He, who shall be sent, (shio, the pacific, his son, to whom it is, or the things are, reserved) arrive; and Him shall the nations expect, (and obey) to Him they shall look up (and be gathered). Whom will the Jews point out to whom all these characters agree, except our divine Lord, whom they also must one day adore? (Haydock)"
      v:011:
        - 'GEN:49:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Foal.</i> The nations, which had not been subjected to the yoke of the old law. --- <i>Vineyard;</i> the house of Israel, the <i>vineyard</i> of the Lord of hosts, Isaias v. 7. Christ broke down the wall of separation, and made <i>both one,</i> Ephesians ii. 14. --- <i>His ass,</i> or the Jews. --- <i>O my son;</i> Juda, the Saviour king, who shall be born of thee, shall tie both Jews and Gentiles to the <i>vine,</i> which is himself, John xv. To the Jews he shall preach in person; but the Gentiles he shall call by his apostles, chosen out of the vineyard of the Jewish church. (Menochius) --- <i>He shall wash his robe,</i> his flesh, and <i>his garment,</i> or all his disciples, in his own <i>blood;</i> adorning them with all graces by means of his death, which must be applied to their souls, in the holy sacraments devoutly received, and in the Mass, where his blood is offered under the appearance of <i>wine.</i> (Haydock) See St. Ambrose, &c. Tertullian, (against Marc. iv.) shewing that Christ fulfilled the figures of the old law, interprets the stole to mean his body, and wine his blood. (Worthington) --- Jacob alludes also to fertility and abundance of vines, which should enrich the portion of Juda, particularly about Engaddi, Canticle of Canticles i. 13. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'GEN:49:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Beautiful.</i> The eyes and teeth contribute much to the beauty of a face. Our Saviour, rising form the dead, filled the hearts of the beholders with joy, as wine exhilarates the heart of man. (Menochius) --- The spouse in the Canticle of Canticles, (ver. 12,) compares the eyes of the bridegroom to the shining reddish, or fiery ones of pigeons: <i>chaclili,</i> beautiful, means shining red, &c. Jesus Christ seems to allude to this prophecy of Jacob, (Matthew xxi. 43. and John x. 16,) telling the Jews, that the <i>kingdom of God</i> should be taken from them, and <i>one fold</i> should be established for all. God would then cease to distinguish the Jews by any other marks than those of his wrath. He would no longer be their king and shepherd. His sceptre, or pastoral crook, should be taken off the tribe of Juda, and it should be confounded with the rest, as it is at this day. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - 'GEN:49:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Road.</i> The territory of Zabulon was famous for good harbours, being situated between the Mediterranean and the sea of Genezareth. (Menochius) --- Jacob marks out the limits to be assigned his children, 200 years before Chanaan was conquered; and Moses wrote this before they possessed a foot of land in it. The reason why Zabulon is placed before his elder brother Issachar, is not known. --- <i>Sidon:</i> not the city, but the territory of Sidon, or Phenicia. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - "GEN:49:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Strong.</i> Hebrew, \"bony ass.\" Many of Jacob's children are compared to animals, which was customary in the eastern style. Homer compares Ajax with the ass, for his strength and patience, Iliad xii. Jacob thus indicates the laborious disposition of Issachar's tribe, which did not delight in war. Their country was the most fruitful of all Galilee. (Calmet)"
      v:016:
        - 'GEN:49:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Dan shall judge,</i> &c. This was verified in Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan, and began to deliver Israel, Judges xiii. 5. But as this deliverance was but temporal and very imperfect, the holy patriarch (ver. 18,) aspires after another kind of deliverer, saying: <i>I will look for thy salvation, O Lord.</i> (Challoner) --- Many have supposed, that Antichrist will be one of his descendants, which makes Jacob break out into this exclamation. (Haydock) --- See St. Irenæus, Against Heresies v. 30, &c. Samson exercised his ingenuity in discomfiting the Philistines. But Antichrist will be far more subtle in deluding the faithful. (Menochius) --- The Danites took Lais, afterwards called Cæsarea Philippi, by stratagem, Judges xviii. (Tirinus)'
      v:019:
        - 'GEN:49:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Gad, being girded,</i> &c. It seems to allude to the tribe of Gad; when, after they had received for their lot the land of Galaad, they marched in arms before the rest of the Israelites, to the conquest of the land of Chanaan: from whence they afterwards returned loaded with spoils. See Josue i. and xxii. (Challoner) --- He alludes continually to the name of Gad, which signifies one "girded, <i>or</i> a troop." See Osee vi. 8; Numbers xxxii. 17. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - 'GEN:49:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Fat,</i> delicious. This country was very luxuriant, Deuteronomy xxxiii. 24. (Menochius)'
      v:021:
        - 'GEN:49:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>A hart.</i> Barach was of this tribe, and seemed rather timid, till he was encouraged by Debora; and his victory gave occasion to that beautiful hymn, Judges v. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - "GEN:49:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Run to and fro,</i> &c. To behold his beauty; whilst his envious brethren turned their darts against him, &c. (Challoner) --- Joseph continued <i>increasing,</i> in spite of the envy of his brethren, and the calumny of Putiphar's wife, who was too much enamoured of his beauty. (Haydock)"
      v:024:
        - 'GEN:49:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>His bow rested upon the strong,</i> &c. That is, upon God, who was his strength: who also <i>loosed his bands,</i> and brought him out of prison to be the <i>pastor,</i> that is, the feeder and ruler of Egypt; and the <i>stone,</i> that is, the rock and support of Israel.'
      v:025:
        - 'GEN:49:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Blessings,</i> &c. 1. Of rain; 2. of springs; 3. of milk, (<i>uberum</i>); and 4. (<i>vulvæ</i>) of children and cattle.'
      v:026:
        - "GEN:49:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>The blessings of thy father,</i> &c. That is, thy father's blessings are made more prevalent and effectual in thy regard, by the additional strength they receive from his inheriting the blessings of his progenitors Abraham and Isaac. --- <i>The desire of the everlasting hills,</i> &c. These blessings all looked forward towards Christ, called <i>the desire of the everlasting hills,</i> as being longed for, as it were, by the whole creation. Mystically, the patriarchs and prophets are called the <i>everlasting hills,</i> by reason of the eminence of their wisdom and holiness. --- <i>The Nazarite.</i> This word signifies one <i>separated;</i> and agrees to Joseph, as being separated from, and more eminent than, his brethren. As the ancient <i>Nazarites</i> were so called from their being set aside for God, and vowed to him. (Challoner) --- <i>Nazir</i> denotes also one chosen or <i>crowned,</i> and is a title of one of the chief courtiers or ministers of the Persian kings. Such was Joseph. (Calmet) --- These blessings were perhaps forfeited by the misconduct of his posterity, when Jeroboam set up the worship of the golden calves; though probably many would subsist of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasses till the coming of the Messias. (Tirinus)"
      v:027:
        - 'GEN:49:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Wolf;</i> alluding to the wars in defence of the inhabitants of Gabaa, and those waged by Saul, Mardocheus, &c. (Menochius) (Judges xix. and xx.) St. Paul was of this tribe; and, from a fiery zealot, became an eminent apostle. (St. Augustine, &c.) (Tirinus)'
      v:028:
        - 'GEN:49:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Proper blessings,</i> or predictions; for Ruben received no blessing. (Haydock)'
      v:029:
        - "GEN:49:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>To be gathered to my people.</i> That is, I am going to die, and so to follow my ancestors that are gone before me, and to join their company in another world. (Challoner) --- Jacob's life was embittered with many afflictions, which he bore with admirable patience, and thus deserved to be considered as an excellent figure of Jesus Christ. --- <i>The man of sorrows.</i> His faith in the promises of God, made him contemplate the land of Chanaan as his own, and parcel it out among his children. (Calmet)"

(Haydock) --- The entrails are taken out, &c., by the embalmer during 30 days, and the body is left in salt and various drugs, for other 40, in all 70 days, as Herodotus informs us, (B. xi. 86,) and as Moses here insinuates, ver. 3. This was an honour peculiar to the kings. Before any person was buried, his praises were rehearsed; and it was lawful on this occasion to declare, what evil even the kings themselves had done; which sometimes caused them to be deprived of funeral honours. We have several funeral canticles preserved in Scripture: 2 Kings i. 18; iii. 33; 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 25. (Calmet) --- The Lamentations of Jeremias were perhaps of this nature, on the death of King Josias. The usual time for mourning among the Jews, was 30 days for people of eminence, (Numbers xx.; Deuteronomy xxxiv. 8; Procopius) and seven for the rest, Ecclesiasticus xxii. 13. (Haydock)'

Perhaps the Egyptians would have been offended, (Worthington) if the corpse of Joseph had been removed out of the country immediately, as that of Jacob was; and they might have taken occasion hence to envy and persecute his brethren.

        - "GEN:50:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Embalmed,</i> like the Egyptian momies, or <i>mummies,</i> which is a Persian word, signifying a dried corpse. Some of them are very magnificent, adorned with golden letters and hieroglyphics, various bandages, &c. They are laid in coffins. Some pretend that Joseph was afterwards adored in Egypt, under the names of Serapis and Osiris: but the grounds of this supposition are only a few uncertain etymologies and emblems, which might agree with him as well as with those modern deities: (Calmet) at least it does not at all appear probable, that he was adored in Egypt before the departure of the Israelites, as the king who persecuted them did not know Joseph, Exodus i. 8. His greatest glory was, to have prefigured Jesus Christ in so wonderful a manner during the course of his life, and to have been replenished with all the graces which could form the character of a great man and a saint. Some think, that the history of Joseph has been imitated in the fable of Proteus, or Cetes, king of Egypt. See the True History of Fabulous Times, by Juerin du Roche, a virtuous and learned ecclesiastic, who was put to death for his faith, at Paris, September 8, 1792. See also Rollin's Abridgment.

      v:006: 'GEN:50:6 | 6 | 6 | And Pharao said to him: Go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear.'
      v:007: "GEN:50:7 | 7 | 7 | So he went up, and there went with him all the ancients of Pharao's house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt."

      v:010: 'GEN:50:10 | 10 | 10 | And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is situated beyond the Jordan: where celebrating the exequies with a great and vehement lamentation, they spent full seven days.'
      v:011: 'GEN:50:11 | 11 | 11 | And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw this, they said: This is a great mourning to the Egyptians. And therefore the name of that place was called, The mourning of Egypt.'

      v:014: 'GEN:50:14 | 14 | 14 | And Joseph returned into Egypt with his brethren, and all that were in his company, after he had buried his father.'
      v:015: 'GEN:50:15 | 15 | 15 | Now he being dead, his brethren were afraid, and talked one with another : Lest perhaps he should remember the wrong he suffered, and requite us all the evil that we did to him.'
      v:016: 'GEN:50:16 | 16 | 16 | And they sent a message to him, saying: Thy father commanded us before he died,'
      v:017: 'GEN:50:17 | 17 | 17 | That we should say thus much to thee from him: I beseech thee to forget the wickedness of thy brethren, and the sin and malice they practised against thee: we also pray thee, to forgive the servants of the God of thy father this wickedness.

      v:020: 'GEN:50:20 | 20 | 20 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}You thought evil against me: but God turned it into good, that he might exalt me, as at present you see, and might save many people.'
      v:021: 'GEN:50:21 | 21 | 21 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Fear not: I will feed you and your children. And he comforted them, and spoke gently and mildly.'

      v:023: 'GEN:50:23 | 23 | 23 | After which he told his brethren: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}God will visit you after my death, and will make you go up out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "The Hebrews now entitle all the Five Books of Moses, from the initial words, which originally were written like one continued word or verse; but the Septuagint have preferred to give the titles the most memorable occurrences of each work. On this occasion, the Creation of all things out of nothing, strikes us with peculiar force. We find a refutation of all the heathenish mythology, and of the world's eternity, which Aristotle endeavoured to establish. We behold the short reign of innocence, and the origin of sin and misery, the dispersion of nations, and the providence of God watching over his chosen people, till the death of Joseph, about the year 2369 (Usher) 2399 (Salien and Tirinus) B.C. 1631. We shall witness the same care in the other Books of Scripture, and adore his wisdom and goodness in preserving to himself faithful witnesses, and a true Holy Catholic Church, in all ages, even when the greatest corruption seemed to overspread the land. (Haydock)"

The Hebrews call it</i> <b>Bereshith</b>, <i>from the word with which it begins. It contains not only the History of the Creation of the World, but also an account of its progress during the space of</i> 2369 <i>years, that is, until the death of</i> <b>Joseph</b>.'
