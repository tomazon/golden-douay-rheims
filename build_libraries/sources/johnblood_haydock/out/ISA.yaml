    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'ISA:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Amos.</i> His name is written in a different manner, in Hebrew, from that of the third among the minor prophets, (Worthington) though St. Augustine has confounded them. --- <i>Ezechias.</i> He wrote this title towards the end of his life, or it was added by Esdras, &c.'
      v:002:
        - 'ISA:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Earth.</i> He apostrophises these insensible things, (Calmet) because they contain all others, and are the most durable. (Theodoret) (Deuteronomy xxxi. 1.)'
      v:005:
        - 'ISA:1:5 | 5 | 5-7 | <i>Sad.</i> This was spoken after Ozias had given way to pride, when the Ammonites, &c., began to disturb Juda, (4 Kings xv. 37., and 2 Paralipomenon xxvii. 7.) under Joathan, who was a good prince, but young. (Calmet) --- <i>Enemies.</i> At the last siege, (St. Jerome) or rather when Jerusalem was taken by the Chaldeans.

      v:011:
        - 'ISA:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Victims.</i> Without piety, they are useless. God tolerated bloody victims to withdraw the people from idolatry, but he often shewed that they were not of much importance, in order that they might be brought to offer the sacrifice of the new law, which eminently includes all the rest.

      v:022:
        - 'ISA:1:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Water.</i> There is no sincerity in commerce. (Calmet) --- Teachers give false interpretations of the law. (St. Jerome) --- Iniquity abounded before the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans and Romans. (Worthington)'
      v:024:
        - 'ISA:1:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Ah!</i> God punishes with regret. (Menochius) --- <i>Comfort.</i> I will take complete vengeance under Joathan, (4 Kings xv. 37.) Achaz, &c.'
      v:025:
        - 'ISA:1:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Tin.</i> I will reform abuses in the reign of Ezechias, but much more by establishing the Church of Christ, which shall be the <i>faithful city.</i> (Calmet)'
      v:026:
        - 'ISA:1:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Judges.</i> The Jews explain this of the judges, and priests, who governed after the captivity; though it refer rather to the apostles, &c. (St. Jerome) (Worthington)'
      v:029:
        - 'ISA:1:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Idols.</i> Protestants, "oaks, which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens," &c. (Haydock) --- The groves were sacred to Venus, and the gardens to Adonis, and were scenes of the greatest immorality and profanation, chap. lxv. 3.'
      v:031:
        - ISA:1:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>It.</i> The efforts of Achan and Ezechias against the enemy proved in vain. (Calmet)

      v:002: 'ISA:1:2 | 2 | 2 | Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken. I have brought up children, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and exalted them, but they have despised me.'
      v:003: "ISA:1:3 | 3 | 3 | The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood."

      v:006: 'ISA:1:6 | 6 | 6 | From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises, and swelling sores: they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.'

      v:011: 'ISA:1:11 | 11 | 11 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}To what purpose <i>do you offer</i> me the multitude of your victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck-goats.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'ISA:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Jerusalem.</i> Many particular prophecies are blended with the general one, which regards Christ. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'ISA:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Days.</i> The whole time of the new law, from the coming of Christ till the end of the world, is called in the Scripture <i>the last days;</i> because no other age, or time shall come after it, but only eternity. (Challoner) --- It is therefore styled the last hour, 1 John ii. (Worthington) --- <i>Mountains.</i> This shews the perpetual visibility of the Church of Christ: for a mountain upon the top of mountains cannot be hid. (Challoner) --- This evidently regards the Church, Matthew v. (Worthington) --- The Jews can never shew the fulfillment of this prophecy in any material temple. Micheas (iv. 1.) copies this text.'
      v:003:
        - 'ISA:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Jerusalem.</i> Our Saviour preached there, and in some sense the religion established by him, may be esteemed a reform, or accomplishment of the old law.'
      v:004:
        - 'ISA:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>War.</i> Ezechias enjoyed peace after the defeat of Sennacherib, as the whole world did at the birth of Christ. (Calmet) --- <i>Claudentur belli portæ.</i> (Virgil, Æneid i.)'
      v:005:
        - 'ISA:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Lord.</i> Ezechias, or rather Christ and his Church, invite all to embrace the true faith. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'ISA:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Jacob.</i> Thus the converts address God, (Haydock) or the prophet gives the reasons of the subversion of the ten tribes. --- <i>Filled.</i> Consecrated as priests. --- <i>Children.</i> Imitating idolatrous nations, (Calmet) and marrying with them, (Calmet; Septuagint; Theodoret) or even giving way to unnatural sins. (St. Jerome) (Menochius) --- The Jews were not utterly cast off till they had put Christ to death. His Church shall never perish. (Worthington)'
      v:008:
        - 'ISA:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Horses.</i> Which the kings were forbidden to multiply, Deuteronomy xvii. 16. Great riches often precede the ruin of states.'
      v:009:
        - 'ISA:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Forgive.</i> Septuagint, "I will not dismiss them." Hebrew, "and thou hast not pardoned them."'
      v:010:
        - 'ISA:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Rock.</i> Screen thyself if thou canst. He alludes to the kingdom of Israel, which was ruined by idolatry, ver. 18, 20.'
      v:013:
        - 'ISA:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Basan.</i> Israel; or Syria and the Ammonites, (Calmet) whom Nabuchodonosor subdued, five years after he had taken Jerusalem, (Josephus, [Jewish Antiquities?] x. 11.) as the Idumeans, (ver. 14.) Philistines, and Egyptians, (ver. 15.) and Tyrians, (ver. 16.) who felt also the indignation of the Lord, Jeremias xxv. 15.'
      v:016:
        - 'ISA:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Tharsis.</i> In Cilicia, denoting large ships for merchandise. --- <i>Fair.</i> Hebrew, "desirable pictures." Septuagint, "ships." (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - 'ISA:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Destroyed.</i> This was verified by the establishment of Christianity. And by this and other texts of the like nature, the wild system of some modern sectaries is abundantly confuted, who charge the whole Christian Church with worshipping idols, for many ages. (Challoner) --- Yea, for above a thousand years, while she still professed the name of Christ. (Worthington)'
      v:020:
        - 'ISA:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Bats.</i> The Egyptians adored all sorts of animals. (Herodotus ii. 65.) --- <i>Ægyptus portenta colat.</i> (Juvenal xv.) --- <i>Omnigenumque Deum monstra.</i> (Virgil, Æneid viii.) --- The mole was much esteemed by magicians, who promised any the art of divination and success, who should eat the heart of one still warm. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxx. 3.) The Israelites were always ready to embrace such superstitious practices. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - "ISA:2:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>High.</i> Adhere to Jesus Christ. (Origen) (Menochius) --- Septuagint omit this sentence, and St. Jerome thinks they did it perhaps for fear of shocking their brethren. In Jeremias xvii. --- It is supplied from Aquila's version, \"how must he be esteemed?\" (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"for wherein is he to be accounted of?\" Jesus will kill the wicked one with the spirit of his mouth, 2 Thessalonians ii. 8. (Haydock) --- No dependence must be had in man. The Israelites vainly trusted in Egypt. (Calmet)"

      v:004: 'ISA:2:4 | 4 | 4 | And he shall judge the Gentiles, and rebuke many people: and they shall turn their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they be exercised any more to war.'

      v:006: 'ISA:2:6 | 6 | 6 | For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob: because they are filled as in times past, and have had soothsayers as the Philistines, and have adhered to strange children.'

(St. Jerome) --- <i>Strength.</i> Hebrew, "staff," or support (Leviticus xxvi. 26.) in the dreadful famine which fell on Jerusalem, Lamentations iv. 5, 10. Who then shall rely on the power of any man? (Chap. ii. 22.) (Calmet) --- The Jews were depressed at the sieges of their city, and will be so till the end of the world. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - 'ISA:3:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Prophet.</i> Ezechiel was taken away under Jechonias. Other prophets were disregarded, and the <i>cunning man,</i> (<i>ariolus,</i> which may be understood in a good or bad sense. Calmet) every false prophet was silent, when danger threatened.'

      v:004:
        - 'ISA:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Effeminate.</i> Hebrew, "babes." Septuagint, "scoffers." Aquila, &c., "changers," (Calmet) who give way to unnatural excesses, Romans i. 27. (Haydock) --- Some manifest a prudence beyond their years: but the last kings of Juda did not, 2 Paralipomenon xxxvi. 1., and Ecclesiastes x. 16.'
      v:005:
        - 'ISA:3:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>People.</i> They were divided, whether they should continue to obey Nabuchodonosor, or listen to the Egyptians. Ismael slew Godolias, Jeremias xli.'

      v:010:
        - 'ISA:3:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Well.</i> Jeremias (xxxix. 11.) was treated by the enemy with great respect. Septuagint, "having said, let us bind the just man, for he is troublesome, (Haydock) or displeasing (Calmet) to us. Hence they," &c. (Haydock) (Wisdom ii. 12.) Many of the Fathers quote it thus.

        - 'ISA:7:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Achaz.</i> This must be seventeen years later than the former prediction, 4 Kings xv. 37. The kings of Syria and Israel jointly attacked Juda, but were forced to raise the siege of Jerusalem. The next year they came separately, and committed the following ravages. The news of their junction threw all into confusion, ver. 2. Isaias was then sent to inform the king, that the designs of his enemies should not take effect. Yet the two kings obtained each a victory. But they could not dethrone Achaz, as they intended. (Calmet) --- Paine traduces this prophecy as a lie, asserting that they succeeded. What! did they make Tabeel king? ver. 6. The Israelites would not even keep the captives who had been taken, 2 Chronicles xxviii. 15. (Watson, let. 5.) --- Achaz had been made captive before. But now the Lord defeated the projects of his enemies, as he will the conspiracy of heretics against his Church. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - 'ISA:7:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Jasub.</i> This name was mysterious: <i>Shear-Jashub</i> means "the rest shall return" from Babylon, or be converted under Ezechias, chap. x. 22. (Calmet) --- Protestants, Go "thou, and Shear-Jashub, thy son, at the end of the conduit," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'ISA:7:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Tails.</i> So he styles the two kings in derision. The distrust of Achaz was punished by the loss of many of his subjects, but he was not dethroned, having engaged the Egyptians and Assyrians to attack his enemies, ver. 17.'

But (Calmet) Ephraim was led captive twenty-one years after, and the Cutheans took their place when sixty-five years had elapsed.

(St. Jerome) --- It was indeed above the sagacity of man to declare that the child to be born would be a boy, and live till the kings should be destroyed. But the prophet undoubtedly speaks of Jesus Christ, <i>the wonderful,</i> &c., (chap. ix. 5.) as well as of a boy, who should prefigure him, and be an earnest of the speedy destruction of the two kings. He was to be born of Isaias, (chap. viii. 4.) and of all the qualities belonging to the true <i>Emmanuel,</i> only that regards him, which intimates that the country should be delivered before he should come to years of discretion, ver. 16. (Calmet, Diss.) (Bossuet) --- The Fathers generally apply all to Christ. --- <i>Called.</i> Or shall be in effect, chap. i. 26.

Was not his reign a figure of the Church persecuted and increasing: but on that account, in danger from a relaxation of discipline?

(Tertullian, &c.) --- <i>Wonderful.</i> In his birth, &c. --- <i>Counsellor.</i> From whom all good advice proceeds. Grotius falsely translates, "the consulter of the strong God," meaning Ezechias. Though he deemed the Socinians unworthy of the Christian name, (Ep. ad Valleum.) he too often sides with them. <i>Johets</i> always means one who "gives counsel," chap. xl. 13. Ezechias was at this time ten years old, and he did not always take advice, nor was his reign peaceful, &c. --- <i>God.</i> The three Greek versions maliciously render <i>El</i> "the strong," though it be uncertain that it ever has that meaning, as it certainly has not when joined with <i>gibbor,</i> "mighty." Why should two terms of the same import be used? The Septuagint copies vary much. Some read only, "he shall be called the angel of the great council, for I will bring peace upon the princes and his health." St. Jerome thinks they were afraid to style the child God. But this reason falls to the ground, as other copies have, (Calmet) after <i>council,</i> "Wonderful, Counsellor, God, the Mighty, the Potent, {GREEK:START exousiaszes}ηξουσιασζησ{GREEK:END}, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the world to come, for, &c., (<b>7.</b>) His." Grabe (de Vitiis lxx. p. 29.) asserts that the former is the genuine version, and that the inserted titles are a <i>secondary</i> one; so that there must have been two version before the days of Aquila, as the text is thus quoted at large by Clement and St. Iræneus, the year of the Lord 180; Kennicott adds also by St. Ignatius, the year of the Lord 110.

        - 'ISA:11:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Root.</i> Juda shall not be exterminated, like the Assyrians. (Calmet) --- Christ shall spring from the blessed Virgin [Mary], (Worthington) for the salvation of mankind. The Jews agree, that this prediction regards the Messias; though some, with Grotius, would explain it literally of Ezechias. They do not reflect that he was now ten years old, and that the prophet speaks of an event which should still take place after he had been a long while upon the throne. If we were to look for any figure of the Messias, to whom this might be applicable, it would be Zorobabel, Zacharias iii. 8. But how disproportionate would be the promises to the execution? Some passages may indeed relate to the return of the captives, (ver. 11.) as the people must have a more immediate object, to insure the accomplishment of the more elevated predictions concerning the Messias: but these also refer ultimately to the propagation of the gospel, which the prophet had also in view. (Calmet)'

(St. Jerome) --- Christ was filled with his seven gifts, and <i>of his fullness</i> his servants <i>receive.</i> (Worthington) --- Yet all virtues are the gifts of the holy Spirit, and the number seven is not specified in Hebrew, as the same word (Calmet) <i>yirath,</i> is rendered <i>godliness,</i> which (ver. 3.) means, <i>the fear of the Lord.</i> (Haydock) --- God enables us to penetrate the difficulties of Scripture, and to act with prudence, &c. (Menochius)'

        - "ISA:11:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Ensign.</i> The cross is the standard of Christians. --- <i>Sepulchre.</i> Hebrew, Septuagint, &c., \"rest.\" St. Jerome give the true sense. The holy places have been greatly reverenced, and Christian princes strove for a long time to recover them. (Calmet) --- They are respected even by the Turks. Christ's death was ignominious, but his monument was full of glory. Thus the saints begin to shine, where the glory of the wicked ends. (Worthington)"
      v:011:
        - 'ISA:11:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Time.</i> After the deliverance from Sennacherib, they shall return from captivity.

(Calmet) --- Septuagint, "and they shall fly on the ships of the strangers; they shall plunder the sea together, and those on the east, and Idumea." (Haydock) --- <i>East.</i> Ammonites, &c., often defeated by the Machabees, and probably by Ezechias.'

(Calmet)'
      v:004:

        - 'ISA:14:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>O Lucifer.</i> O day-star. All this, according to the letter, is spoken of the king of Babylon. It may also be applied, in a spiritual sense, to Lucifer, the prince of devils, who was created a bright angel, but fell by pride and rebellion against God. (Challoner) (Luke x. 18.) (Calmet) --- He fell by pride, as Nabuchodonosor did. (Worthington) --- Homer (Iliad xix.) represents the demon of discord hurled down by Jupiter to the miserable region of mortals.'

        - 'ISA:14:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Grave.</i> Strangers seized the crown of Baltassar, and neglected his sepulchre: or if we explain it of Nabuchodonosor, his tomb was probably plundered, (Calmet) as the Persians did not spare that of Belus. In the reign of Alexander, the tombs of the kings were covered with water, and filled with serpents. (Arrian. vii.)'

        - 'ISA:45:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Anointed,</i> often implies one chosen for some great work. Cyrus was to ruin the empire of Babylon, and to set the nations at liberty. He was a proof of the Deity by executing his decrees. --- <i>Cyrus.</i> Some copies of the Septuagint seem to have read {GREEK:START kurio}κυριο{GREEK:END}, "to the Lord," incorrectly. (St. Jerome) --- Though Cyrus was not anointed, he is styled thus, in allusion to the custom of the Jewish kings. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - ISA:45:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Brass.</i> Babylon had 100 such gates. (Herodotus i. 179.)
      v:003:
        - 'ISA:45:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Treasures.</i> See Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxiii. 3. He overcame the rich king of Lydia, &c.'
      v:004:
        - 'ISA:45:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Likeness</i> of Christ. --- <i>Known me.</i> Before the Jews had shewn Cyrus the prophecies, he did not attribute his success to the Lord, and even afterwards he seems not to have left the superstitions of his country, as his sacrifices to idols are described. He resembled Nabuchodonosor and the philosophers, who did not glorify God according to their knowledge, Daniel ii. 47., and Romans i. 21. Cyrus even revoked the decree for building the temple, 1 Esdras iv. 5. (Calmet) --- He believed there was one God; (1 Esdras i.) yet he did not embrace the truth entirely. (Worthington)'
      v:007:
        - 'ISA:45:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Create evil,</i> &c. The evils of afflictions and punishments, but not the evil of sin. (Challoner) --- I afflict and comfort my people.'
      v:008:
        - 'ISA:45:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Saviour.</i> Thus the ancient saints thirsted for the coming of Christ. His figure is styled the just, chap. xli. 2, 25. --- <i>Him.</i> Christ, born of the virgin, in time, and of God from all eternity. I have appointed Cyrus to be his precursor, to set the captives free. (Calmet) --- He has been spoken of before. But now the prophet turns to Christ alone, who built his Church on a rock. (Worthington) --- Cyrus had not a right faith in God, and Zorobabel was himself set free, and was not king. (St. Jerome)'
      v:009:
        - 'ISA:45:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Earthen.</i> Literally, "Samian." (Haydock) --- Samos was famous for its pottery. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxv. 12.) Hebrew, "Clay, <i>disputest thou</i> against the potters of the earth?" He shews the folly of idols, after having proved his own divinity. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "Let the potsherds <i>strive</i> with the potsherds of the earth." (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - 'ISA:45:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Forth.</i> As such language would be improper to parents, so it is wrong to complain that God places us in any situation. (Menochius)'

      v:013:
        - 'ISA:45:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Justice.</i> Cyrus shall punish the Chaldeans and restore the Jews. (Calmet) --- The prophet returns to him after having mentioned a greater Saviour, ver. 8. (Houbigant)'
      v:014:
        - 'ISA:45:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Stature:</i> the people of Saba were the tallest and best proportioned in Arabia. (Agathar. v. 50.) --- Cyrus possessed all these countries. He sent the Egyptians home in the third year of his reign, at Babylon, the year of the world 3470, Ezechiel xxix. 11. They never became subject to the Jews; but embraced the religion of Christ, acknowledging him for God, ver. 15. (Calmet) --- <i>Besides thee.</i> Protestants, "Surely God <i>is</i> in thee, and <i>there is</i> none else, <i>there is</i> no God." Those whom we have hitherto adored, deserve not the name. Vulgate and Septuagint make the people address Christ, the God-man. (Haydock)'
      v:015:
        - 'ISA:45:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Saviour.</i> We confess that thou hast delivered the Jews; or rather, we acknowledge that thou, O Christ, art true God under the veils of thy human nature, and Saviour of all. Cyrus was only a feeble representation of thee.'
      v:016:
        - 'ISA:45:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Confusion.</i> Idolaters shall be confounded, when they shall behold the glory of the elect.'

        - 'ISA:45:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>In vain.</i> Hebrew, "to be a chaos," Genesis viii. 2.'
      v:019:
        - 'ISA:45:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Earth.</i> The pagan oracles were given chiefly in mountains, where the impostures of the priests might escape detection. They were also generally ambiguous, or mere guesses. The declarations of the true prophets were quite the reverse. --- <i>In vain;</i> without reward. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - 'ISA:45:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Gentiles:</i> converts, (Haydock) or Jews, returning from Babylon.'
      v:021:
        - 'ISA:45:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Me.</i> He transports his auditors to the times succeeding the captivity, when the completion of the prophecies will be evident.'
      v:023:
        - "ISA:45:23 | 23 | 23-24 | <i>Myself,</i> having none greater, Hebrews vi. 13. --- <i>Justice:</i> sure. --- <i>To me.</i> All that are born belong to me. The Jewish women had seldom recourse to midwives, (Exodus i. 19., and 1 Kings iv. 19.; Calmet) no more than the Ethiopians. (Ludolf. i. 14.) --- <i>Swear,</i> by the true God. (Haydock) --- Oaths on proper occasions, honour him, Deuteronomy vi. 13. Nothing could be spoken more plainly of the Gentiles' conversion."
      v:025:
        - 'ISA:45:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Empire.</i> Cyrus shall make this confession, (1 Esdras i. 2.) and all who embrace the religion of Christ, shall attribute all their virtue to him.'

      v:002: 'ISA:50:2 | 2 | 2 | Because I came, and there was not a man: I called, and there was none that would hear. {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Is my hand shortened and become little, that I cannot redeem? or is there no strength in me to deliver?

        - 'ISA:52:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Servant,</i> Christ. In vain do the Jews attempt to apply this to any other. It is wonderful that Grotius should follow their steps, and understand Jeremias to be meant; though elsewhere he allows that the prophet speaks only of the Messias. (De Verit. v. 19.) --- This author [Grotius] has been of great prejudice to religion. The Chaldean and many modern Jews have been compelled by evidence to apply this to the Messias. See Geir., &c.

Notwithstanding his abject condition, He was the desired of all nations, and by his wounds we are healed. (Haydock) --- Some assert that the person of Christ was not beautiful, while others think that his wounds prevented it from being discerned. Salmeron would supply a negation from the first number: "We have not desired him."'

St. Philip follows this version in explaining this passage to the eunuch, Acts viii. 33. --- <i>Generation,</i> from his eternal Father or from the Virgin [Mary], his incarnation, life, resurrection, or posterity in the Church. All these may be meant, and are inexplicable. (Calmet)'

        - 'ISA:53:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Death.</i> Hebrew, "and he made his grave with the wicked <i>men,</i> and with the rich <i>man,</i> in his death." (Haydock) --- Grave and death seem to be transposed; and we might better read, "He was taken up with wicked men in his death, and with a rich man was his sepulchre." This indeed is only a conjecture, but well grounded in the context. See Josue xxiv. 19. (Kennicott) --- Septuagint, "and I will give the wicked for his grave, and the rich men for his death." (Haydock) --- The <i>rich man</i> may denote the small number of Jews who embraced the faith. (Calmet) --- They esteemed themselves rich, and were highly favoured by God; yet they were blinded, (Haydock) and given up to the Romans, in punishment of their deicide, Matthew xxvii. 25. The Church is gathered both from Jews and Gentiles, ver. 10. (Calmet) (St. Jerome) --- "He will send to hell the wicked," (Chaldean) who slew him. (Menochius) --- Christ was buried where malefactors were generally, yet honourably, in the tomb of Joseph [of Arimathea]. (Worthington) (Matthew xxvii. 57.)'

      v:003:
        - "ISA:56:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>People.</i> The Jews would not admit all nations to their communion, Deuteronomy xxxiii. 1. A little before Christ's coming, they began to make more proselytes; (Matthew xxiii. 15.) and the sacred books being translated, came to the knowledge of the Gentiles, who were thus induced by degrees to embrace the true faith. The road to heaven was always open for those who kept the commandments, (ver. 6.; Calmet) though they might not receive circumcision. (Haydock) --- Christ has removed the wall of separation, (Ephesians ii. 14.; Calmet) and established <i>one fold</i> for all, John x. (Haydock)"
      v:004:
        - "ISA:56:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Eunuchs.</i> It was ignominious to have no children among the Jews, as the propagation of the true religion depended much on their numbers. But now, since the Church is gathered from all nations, virginity is preferable to marriage, and those who keep the <i>sabbath,</i> or all the commandments, and <i>choose</i> this state freely, will receive greater glory than the other <i>sons and daughters of</i> God. Against this plain meaning, P. Martyr (de Cœlib.) asserts that God prefers eunuchs only before those who transgress the law. But he gives them <i>a place better</i> than his other <i>sons,</i> &c.! Protestants (Bible, 1603) understand that eunuchs <i>shall be called after</i> (or according to) <i>God's people, and be of the same religion,</i> which implies no preference at all. They add, therefore, <i>yea, under Christ the dignity of the faithful shall be greater than the Jews were at that time;</i> as if the comparison were between God's servants before and after Christ, and not between eunuchs and such as have children. How much better is it for us to follow the holy Fathers, who hence commend those who make a vow of perpetual chastity? They shall possess an excellent dignity among the angels. (St. Basil, virg.) --- The rewards of continency are great, <i>eximia.</i> (St. Cyril of Alexandria, hic.) --- \"In the eternal mansion they are preferred before children.\" (St. Gregory, past. iii. 29., &c.) (Worthington) --- Such spiritual eunuchs, as St. John the evangelist, are meant. \"He hath chosen what the Lord would, that he should offer more than was commanded....He who is an eunuch, and performs all that is prescribed, shall have....the best place, so that he shall be a tower, and occupy the rank of a priest, and instead of children of the flesh, shall have many spiritual children.\" (St. Jerome) (Haydock) --- The law excluded eunuchs from the Church, Deuteronomy xxiii. 1. But under the gospel, they may enter heaven, Matthew xix., and 1 Corinthians vii. 32., &c. Daniel (i. 3.) and his companions were eunuchs, yet in high estimation; and virtuous eunuchs are commended, Wisdom iii. 13. (Calmet) --- <i>Choose.</i> Observing the commandments and counsels, like religious men. (Menochius) --- Those who <i>choose</i> to do more than is commanded, will have a greater reward.

      v:003: 'ISA:59:3 | 3 | 3 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity: your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue uttereth iniquity.'
      v:004: 'ISA:59:4 | 4 | 4 | There is none that calleth upon justice, neither is there any one that judgeth truly: but they trust in a mere nothing, and speak vanities: they have conceived labour, and brought forth iniquity.'
      v:005: 'ISA:59:5 | 5 | 5 | They have broken the eggs of asps, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and have woven the webs of spiders: he that shall eat of their eggs, shall die: and that which is brought out, shall be hatched into a basilisk.'
      v:006: 'ISA:59:6 | 6 | 6 | Their webs shall not be for clothing, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are unprofitable works, and the work of iniquity is in their hands.'
      v:007: 'ISA:59:7 | 7 | 7 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are unprofitable thoughts: wasting and destruction are in their ways.'
      v:008: 'ISA:59:8 | 8 | 8 | They have not known the way of peace, and there is no judgment in their steps: their paths are become crooked to them: every one that treadeth in them, knoweth no peace.'
      v:009: 'ISA:59:9 | 9 | 9 | Therefore is judgment far from us, and justice shall not overtake us. We looked for light, and behold darkness: brightness, and we have walked in the dark.'
      v:010: 'ISA:59:10 | 10 | 10 | We have groped for the wall, and like the blind we have groped as if we had no eyes: we have stumbled at noon-day, as in darkness, <i>we are</i> in dark places, as dead <i>men</i>.'
      v:011: 'ISA:59:11 | 11 | 11 | We shall roar all of us like bears, and shall lament as mournful doves. We have looked for judgment, and there is none: for salvation, and it is far from us.'
      v:012: 'ISA:59:12 | 12 | 12 | For our iniquities are multiplied before thee, and our sins have testified against us: for our wicked doings are with us, and we have known our iniquities,'
      v:013: 'ISA:59:13 | 13 | 13 | In sinning and lying against the Lord: and we have turned away so that we went not after our God, but spoke calumny and transgression: we have conceived, and uttered from the heart, words of falsehood.'
      v:014: 'ISA:59:14 | 14 | 14 | And judgment is turned away backward, and justice hath stood far off: because truth hath fallen down in the street, and equity could not come in.'
      v:015: 'ISA:59:15 | 15 | 15 | And truth hath been forgotten: and he that departed from evil, lay open to be a prey: and the Lord saw, and it appeared evil in his eyes, because there is no judgment.'
      v:016: 'ISA:59:16 | 16 | 16 | And he saw that there is not a man: and he stood astonished, because there is none to oppose himself: and his own arm brought salvation to him, and his own justice supported him.'
      v:017: 'ISA:59:17 | 17 | 17 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}He put on justice as a breast-plate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head: he put on the garments of vengeance, and was clad with zeal as with a cloak.'
      v:018: 'ISA:59:18 | 18 | 18 | As unto revenge, as it were to repay wrath to his adversaries, and a reward to his enemies: he will repay the like to the islands.'
      v:019: 'ISA:59:19 | 19 | 19 | And they from the west, shall fear the name of the Lord: and they from the rising of the sun, his glory: when he shall come as a violent stream, which the spirit of the Lord driveth on:'
      v:020: 'ISA:59:20 | 20 | 20 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And there shall come a Redeemer to Sion, and to them that return from iniquity in Jacob, saith the Lord.'
      v:021: "ISA:59:21 | 21 | 21 | This is my covenant with them, saith the Lord: My spirit that is in thee, and my words that I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth, and for ever."

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'ISA:61:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Lord.</i> Hebrew adds, "God." Adonai seems to have been inserted to prevent the pronunciation of Jehovah, (Kennicott) which alone occurs in the Septuagint, Arabic, and in St. Luke, iv. 18. (Haydock) --- Thus Elohim may have been substituted for Jehovah, Genesis xxii. 8., as [in] [Genesis xxii.] ver. 14, "Abraham called the name of that place <i>Jehovah jireh,</i> because he had said that day on the mount: Jehovah will provide" a victim, even Jesus Christ in the same place. <i>Perhaps</i> no part of the Bible is "so absurdly translated" as this, (Kennicott) by <i>Protestants.</i> (Haydock) --- St. Luke follows the Septuagint in his quotation, only instead of <i>to preach a,</i> &c., he has an explanation, <i>to set at liberty them that are bruised.</i> Isaias may here speak of himself, (Chaldean) yet only as a figure of Christ. The Jews admit that the Messias is meant. Christ had received the Holy Spirit at the Jordan, John i. 32. He performed these works, (Luke vii. 22.) particularly addressing his discourse to the meek and poor, Sophonias iii. 12., and Zacharias xi. 7., and 1 Corinthians i. 26. (Calmet) --- He was not anointed with oil, like Aaron, but with the Holy Ghost; so that <i>of his fullness</i> others must receive, Acts x. 39., &c. (Worthington)'

        - 'ISA:61:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Priests.</i> They were greatly honoured, (Exodus xix. 6.) so that the sons of David had the appellation. The Jews had still to labour as before. Christians become heirs to these promises, and are styled a royal priesthood, 1 Peter ii. 9., and Apocalypse i. 6. They have received the Scriptures from the Jews, and employ human sciences for the advancement of religion. The wisest pagans yield to the force of truth.'

        - 'ISA:61:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Part:</i> God, or the <i>land.</i> Converts shall bless God for having withdrawn them from the crowd of infidels, and they will rejoice in suffering for his sake, (Calmet) preferring their lot before that of unbelievers. Before this change the apostles grieved. (Worthington)'

(Eusebius, præp. iv. 14.) --- Septuagint, \"hate unjust plunder.\" (Haydock) --- Therefore will I subject the strangers to you, ver. 5. --- <i>Truth.</i> I will grant a sure reward. --- <i>Covenant.</i> These of Nehemias and the Machabees were soon forgotten: but Christ's covenant shall abide for ever."
      v:009:

(Challoner) --- St. Jerome with reason finds it difficult to explain it of Christ, as it regards the Machabees. (Houbigant) --- The first six verses are applied to our Saviour's ascension, which excites the admiration of angels, Psalm xxiii. 7. Judas, the Machabee, the glorious figure of Christ, is introduced speaking in this and the following chapter. He conquered Idumea, (1 Machabees v. 3., and 2 Machabees x. 10.) and fought <i>to save</i> the people, 1 Machabees ix. 21.

(Challoner) --- Abraham is not able to save us. (Calmet) --- The patriarchs may justly disregard us, as degenerate children; yet we hope in God's mercies. Thus St. Jerome, &c., explain the passage, which does not favour the errors of Vigilantius and of Luther, who maintain that the saints departed do not know what passes in this world. St. Augustine (Cura xv.) shews the contrary, from the example of Lazarus, Luke xvi. They know each other, though they had not lived together, (St. Gregory, Dial. iv. 33.) and behold in the light of God what regards their clients. (St. Augustine, City of God xxii. 29.)

(Challoner) --- They had abused his patience, to sin the more. (Theodoret) --- The Jews are accustomed to attribute all to God, though they agree with us in reality God might prevent any sin. (Calmet) --- But he chooses to leave man to the free exercise of his liberty. He hardens (Haydock) "not by infusing malice, but by not shewing mercy; and those to whom he shews it not, are undeserving."

(St. Jerome) --- The good works which are done by grace, and not by man alone, cannot be said to be of this description. They constitute the internal glory of man, and God will one day crown these his gifts. Of ourselves indeed we can do nothing, and the works of the Mosaic law will not avail, as St. Paul inculcates; but those works, point out the saint, which are preformed by <i>charity</i> with <i>faith</i> in Christ. This justice is not imputed only, but real; and shews where true faith exists, according to St. James. Thus the apostles explain each other.

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - 'This inspired writer is called by the Holy Ghost, (Ecclesiasticus xlviii. 25.) <i>the great prophet;</i> from the greatness of his prophetic spirit, by which he hath foretold, so long before, and in so clear a manner, the coming of Christ, the mysteries of our redemption, the calling of the Gentiles, and the glorious establishment, and perpetual flourishing of the Church of Christ: insomuch that he seems to have been rather an evangelist than a prophet. His very name is not without mystery: for <i>Isaias</i> in Hebrew signifies <i>the salvation of the Lord,</i> or, <i>Jesus is the Lord.</i> He was, according to the tradition of the Hebrews, of the blood royal of the kings of Juda; and after a most holy life, ended his days by a glorious martyrdom; being sawed in two, at the command of his wicked son-in-law, king Manasses, for reproving his evil ways. (Challoner) --- He began to prophesy ten years before the foundation of Rome, and the ruin of Ninive. His style is suitable to his high birth. He may be called the prophet of the mercies of the Lord. Under the figure of the return from captivity, he foretells the redemption of mankind (Calmet) with such perspicuity, that he might seem to be an evangelist. (St. Jerome)'
