    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'ECC:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Jerusalem.</i> This clearly designates Solomon. See ver. 12., and chap. xii. 8.'
      v:002:
        - "ECC:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Vanities.</i> Most vain and despicable, (Calmet) and frustrating the expectations of men. (Menochius) --- St. Augustine reads <i>vanitantium,</i> and infers that this vanity of sublunary things is an effect of man's sin. Yet he afterwards discovered that he had read incorrectly. (Retractions i. 7.)"
      v:003:
        - 'ECC:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Labour.</i> People fight for a mere <i>point;</i> for such is the earth compared with the universe. (Seneca, q. Nat.) <i>Hoc est punctum,</i> &c., Matthew xvi. 26.'
      v:004:
        - 'ECC:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Ever.</i> Its substance remains, though the form be changed. (Calmet) --- At the end of time, it will be purified to continue for ever. (Worthington)'
      v:005:
        - ECC:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Place</i> daily. Its annual motion is then mentioned. (Calmet)
      v:006:
        - 'ECC:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Spirit.</i> The sun, (St. Jerome) which is like the soul of the world, and which some have falsely asserted to be animated; or rather (Calmet) the wind is meant, as one rises in different parts of the world when another falls. (Pliny, [Natural History?] ii. 27.) (Menochius)'
      v:007:
        - 'ECC:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Again.</i> The sea furnishes vapours, &c. Homer (Iliad {GREEK:START Ph}Φ{GREEK:END}.) expresses himself in the same manner.'
      v:008:
        - 'ECC:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Hearing.</i> In all sciences there are many difficulties. If a man had arrived at perfect knowledge, his researches would cease.'
      v:010:
        - "ECC:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>New.</i> Such vicissitudes have occurred before, though we must not infer that the world is eternal; or that there have been many others before this, as Origen would suppose. (Prin. iii. 5., &c.) (Calmet) --- Men's souls, which are created daily, are nevertheless of the same sort as Adam's was; and creatures proceed from others of the same species, which have been from the beginning. (St. Thomas Aquinas p. 1. q. 73.) (Worthington) --- Natural and moral things continue much the same. (Menochius)"
      v:011:
        - ECC:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Things.</i> Otherwise we should read of similar events to those which we behold. The same cause naturally produces the same effect.
      v:012:
        - ECC:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Israel.</i> This was the case with none of Solomon's descendants. (Calmet)
      v:014:
        - 'ECC:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Vexation.</i> Hebrew also, "food of wind;" (Symmachus) or "choice of the spirit." (Septuagint) People are eager to become learned, and yet find no satisfaction. (Haydock) --- All natural things are insufficient to procure felicity. (Worthington){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>O Curas hominum! O quantum est in rebus inane!</i> (Persius.)'
      v:015:
        - 'ECC:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Perverse.</i> Habitual and obstinate sinners. (Calmet) --- <i>Fools,</i> who follow the broad road. (Haydock) --- Hebrew and Septuagint, "the defect cannot be numbered." We know not to what a height the soul of man might have risen, if he had continued faithful.'
      v:016:
        - 'ECC:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Learned.</i> Solomon was blessed both with a natural genius, which he improved by study, and also he had the gift of supernatural wisdom. Yet he declares that all is vanity and pain.'
      v:017:
        - 'ECC:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Errors.</i> Septuagint, "parables and science." But to discern the mistakes of men is a part of wisdom, (Calmet) and Grabe substitutes "wanderings," instead of "parables," after Theodotion, as Hebrew <i>ealluth</i> (Haydock) means "errors," (Calmet) or "follies." (Montanus)'
      v:018:
        - 'ECC:1:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Labour.</i> He is bound to do more for heaven, as he is convinced of his own defects, and of the strict judgments of God. Wisdom is not true happiness, but the means to obtain it. (Worthington) --- The more a person knows, the more he is convinced of his own ignorance, (Calmet) and filled with grief, that wisdom should be so much concealed. (St. Jerome) --- Those who are learned, feel indignant that their disciples should be so dull. (Menochius)'

      v:009: 'ECC:1:9 | 9 | 9 | What is it that hath been? the same thing that shall be. What is it that hath been done? the same that shall be done.'
      v:010: 'ECC:1:10 | 10 | 10 | Nothing under the sun is new, neither is any man able to say: Behold, this is new: for it hath already gone before, in the ages that were before us.'

      v:012: 'ECC:1:12 | 12 | 12 | I, Ecclesiastes, was king over Israel, in Jerusalem.'
      v:013: 'ECC:1:13 | 13 | 13 | And I proposed in my mind to seek and search out wisely concerning all things that are done under the sun. This painful occupation hath God given to the children of men, to be exercised therein.'
      v:014: 'ECC:1:14 | 14 | 14 | I have seen all things that are done under the sun, and behold all is vanity, and vexation of spirit.'
      v:015: 'ECC:1:15 | 15 | 15 | The perverse are hard to be corrected, and the number of fools is infinite.'
      v:016: 'ECC:1:16 | 16 | 16 | I have spoken in my heart, saying: Behold, I am become great, and have gone beyond all in wisdom, that were before me in Jerusalem: and my mind hath contemplated many things wisely, and I have learned.'
      v:017: 'ECC:1:17 | 17 | 17 | And I have given my heart to know prudence, and learning, and errors, and folly: and I have perceived that in these also there was labour, and vexation of spirit,'
      v:018: 'ECC:1:18 | 18 | 18 | Because in much wisdom there is much indignation: and he that addeth knowledge, addeth also labour.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'ECC:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Delights.</i> He speaks in the name of libertines, (St. Gregory, Dial. iv. 4.) or after his conversion. (Calmet) --- The worldling might object that since wisdom affords not content, it is best to try pleasure. But this meets not with the approbation of the wise, as all terrestrial joy is short, and can yield no more than a passing consolation. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - 'ECC:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Why.</i> Hebrew, "What doth that?" Septuagint, "Why dost thou so?" Immoderate laughter is a sign of folly, Ecclesiasticus xxi. 23. (Calmet) --- "Even spiritual joy is a temptation." (St. Jerome)'
      v:003:
        - 'ECC:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Wine,</i> and to lead a temperate life. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "to give myself unto wine, (yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom) and to lay hold on folly," &c. (Haydock) --- I wished to indulge myself in pleasure, yet so as not to lose the reputation of wisdom, chap. v. 9. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'ECC:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Works;</i> palaces, towns, and particularly the temple. Many, like Solomon, will refrain from wine, and still yield to other excesses.'
      v:005:
        - 'ECC:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Orchards.</i> Hebrew, "paradises," in which fruit-trees were planted. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'ECC:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Family</i> of slaves, "born in my house," (Protestants) distinct from those whom I <i>got</i> for money. (Haydock) --- There were generally procured from foreign nations, as the Hebrews obtained their liberty on the sabbatic year. --- <i>Sheep.</i> David had the like; but Solomon had also horses, 3 Kings x. 21.'
      v:008:
        - 'ECC:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Silver,</i> which became, in consequence, of little value. --- <i>Singing.</i> At the court of Persia, people sung all night, and during the feasts. (Athen. xii., and 14.) --- <i>Cups and vessels;</i> (Aquila and Symmachus) or, "men and women to," &c., (Septuagint) or "a field and fields;" (Calmet) or, Protestants, "<i>as</i> musical instruments, and that of all sorts." Hebrew <i>shidda beshiddoth.</i> (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'ECC:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Wisdom,</i> not that which was supernatural, and could not be found amid such delights, ver. 3., and James iii. 17. I knew that all this was vanity. (Calmet){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Video meliora proboque,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Deteriora sequor.</i> (Ovid) (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - 'ECC:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Labour.</i> Hebrew, "and this was my portion of all my labour." I perceived that I could not thus obtain content. (Calmet) --- "Thou (O God) hast made us for thyself, and our hearts are restless till they repose in thee." (St. Augustine, Confessions i. 1.) (Menochius) --- Aurelius makes the same confession as Solomon, respecting the insatiable nature of his own heart, and the emptiness of pleasure, &c.'
      v:012:
        - "ECC:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>What.</i> Hebrew, \"For what man shall come after the king?\" Septuagint, \"after counsel?\" Many other versions may be given of this obscure text. Solomon stopt at human wisdom, without consulting the divine; or he asks who shall have greater facility to acquire knowledge than himself, or equal his works? (Calmet) --- Man's wisdom compared with God's is contemptible; though it be preferable to folly. (Menochius)"
      v:014:
        - 'ECC:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Darkness</i> and ignorance. He knows not whither he is going, Proverbs iv. 19., and xvii. 24. Wisdom is to be preferred before wealth, &c. (Calmet) --- Consideration directs a person to do good. --- <i>Alike.</i> Thus worldlings speak, who reflect not on the life to come. (Worthington) --- In many respects all resemble one another, though their sentence be very different. (Menochius)'
      v:015:
        - 'ECC:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Vanity.</i> This inference was false, (ver. 16.) or my labouring for wisdom was to no purpose. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "I then spoke more in my heart, (for the fool speaks out of <i>his</i> abundance) since this also is vanity." (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - 'ECC:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Unlearned.</i> He answers, (Jansenius) or rather continues the objections. (Geier) (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'ECC:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Life.</i> Hebrew, "I hated life," as all is attended with anxiety, Romans vii. 24.'
      v:019:
        - "ECC:2:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Solicitous.</i> We naturally desire to have our plans perfected. Solomon had, perhaps, a presentiment of Roboam's misconduct, Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 27."
      v:020:
        - 'ECC:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Off,</i> in a sort of despair; suggested by worldly wisdom. Religion alone can impart steady principles. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "I went about, to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun;" in the transactions of the world. (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - 'ECC:2:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Wisdom.</i> The writings of the wise are often perverted by perverse heretics. (St. Jerome) --- Idle heirs dissipate the possessions, which had been accumulated with such industry. (Calmet) --- Riches tend to encourage the profligacy of the heir. (Menochius)'
      v:024:
        - 'ECC:2:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Drink,</i> using with moderation the things which we have acquired, rather than to be solicitous for more, (Worthington) --- which may fall into the hands of an idle heir, who is appointed by <i>God,</i> ver. 26. This may also be the plea of libertines, (Calmet) who would use freely what he has given. (St. Augustine, contra Jul. iv. 3.)'
      v:026:
        - 'ECC:2:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Pleased God,</i> though he may not be his relation, Proverbs xxvi. 16., and Job xiii. 22. (Calmet)'

      v:002: 'ECC:2:2 | 2 | 2 | Laughter I counted error: and to mirth I said: Why art thou vainly deceived?'
      v:003: 'ECC:2:3 | 3 | 3 | I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind to wisdom, and might avoid folly, till I might see what was profitable for the children of men: and what they ought to do under the sun, all the days of their life.'
      v:004: 'ECC:2:4 | 4 | 4 | I made me great works, I built me houses, and planted vineyards.'
      v:005: 'ECC:2:5 | 5 | 5 | I made gardens, and orchards, and set them with trees of all kinds.'
      v:006: 'ECC:2:6 | 6 | 6 | And I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood of the young trees.'
      v:007: 'ECC:2:7 | 7 | 7 | I got me men-servants, and maid-servants, and had a great family: and herds of oxen, and great flocks of sheep, above all that were before me in Jerusalem:'
      v:008: 'ECC:2:8 | 8 | 8 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}I heaped together for myself silver and gold, and the wealth of kings, and provinces: I made me singing men, and singing women, and the delights of the sons of men, cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine:'
      v:009: 'ECC:2:9 | 9 | 9 | And I surpassed in riches all that were before me in Jerusalem: my wisdom also remained with me.'
      v:010: 'ECC:2:10 | 10 | 10 | And whatsoever my eyes desired, I refused them not: and I withheld not my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and delighting itself in the things which I had prepared: and esteemed this my portion, to make use of my own labour.'
      v:011: 'ECC:2:11 | 11 | 11 | And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had wrought, and to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain, I saw in all things vanity, and vexation of mind, and that nothing was lasting under the sun.'
      v:012: 'ECC:2:12 | 12 | 12 | I passed further to behold wisdom, and errors, and folly, (What is man, said I, that he can follow the king, his maker?)'
      v:013: 'ECC:2:13 | 13 | 13 | And I saw that wisdom excelled folly, as much as light differeth from darkness.'
      v:014: 'ECC:2:14 | 14 | 14 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}The eyes of a wise man are in his head: the fool walketh in darkness: and I learned that they were to die both alike.'
      v:015: 'ECC:2:15 | 15 | 15 | And I said in my heart: If the death of the fool and mine shall be one, what doth it avail me, that I have applied myself more to the study of wisdom? And speaking with my own mind, I perceived that this also was vanity.'
      v:016: 'ECC:2:16 | 16 | 16 | For there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than of the fool for ever, and the times to come shall cover all things together with oblivion: the learned dieth in like manner as the unlearned.'
      v:017: 'ECC:2:17 | 17 | 17 | And, therefore, I was weary of my life, when I saw that all things under the sun are evil, and all vanity, and vexation of spirit.'

      v:020: 'ECC:2:20 | 20 | 20 | Wherefore I left off, and my heart renounced labouring any more under the sun.'
      v:021: 'ECC:2:21 | 21 | 21 | For when a man laboureth in wisdom, and knowledge, and carefulness, he leaveth what he hath gotten to an idle man: so this also is vanity, and a great evil.'
      v:022: 'ECC:2:22 | 22 | 22 | For what profit shall a man have of all his labour, and vexation of spirit, with which he hath been tormented under the sun?'

        - 'ECC:3:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Who knoweth,</i> &c., viz., <i>experimentally;</i> since no one in this life can see a spirit. But as to the spirit of the beasts, which is merely <i>animal,</i> and becomes extinct by the death of the beast, who can tell the manner it acts so as to give life and motion, and by death to descend downward, that is, to be no more? (Challoner) --- Few are able to prove that the soul of man is immortal rather than that of beasts, since the bodies of both are subject to the like inconveniences. The objection is answered [in] chap. xii. 7. (Calmet) --- The difficulty of answering is intimated by "Who?" &c., Psalm xiv. 1. (Menochius)'
      v:022:
        - 'ECC:3:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>After him.</i> He knows not who shall be his heir, or how soon he may die. None returns from the other world to inform him of what is there transacted. Thus the libertine encourages himself. (Calmet)'

      v:008:
        - 'ECC:7:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Oppression.</i> Literally, "calumny." The most perfect can hardly bear it.

(Calmet) --- Though a plurality of wives was then permitted, Solomon did wrong in marrying strangers; and in suffering himself to be deluded by them, so as to erect temples to their respective idols. (Haydock) --- All the attractions of women are replete with danger, and can only be overcome by God's grace, and by flight, 1 Corinthians iv. 8., and Proverbs vii. 22., and xxii. 14. (Calmet)"
      v:029:
        - 'ECC:7:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Man.</i> The superior part of the soul rarely thinks of good; but the sensual part always inclines to evil.

(Protestants) (Haydock) --- The pagans distinguished real goods and evils from those which were only apparent, like prosperity and adversity, which are determined only by the good or bad use. (St. Jerome) --- Thus religion looks upon virtue and vice in the former light; and riches, poverty, &c., in the latter. It may be difficult to decide, whether, under adversity, the just have supported themselves better by virtue, or the wicked by vanity. God will manifest the truth.

        - 'ECC:9:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>There.</i> Even those who have had the vanity to claim divine honours, never could persuade themselves that they would escape death.

He looks upon his life only as a preparation for the other, (Hebrews xi. 13., and Ephesians ii. 19.) while libertines make haste to enjoy the fleeting pleasure, Isaias xxii. 13. To the former death seems desirable, (chap. iv. 2., and vi. 3.) to the latter it is a subject of consternation; and he prefers the vilest creature living, to the most noble when dead.

The dominion of young men and of luxurious judges is reproved, as well as innovations in matters of religion, Isaias iii. 4. Those are blessed who have Christ for their head, descending from the patriarchs and saints, (over whom sin ruled not, and who of course were free) and from the blessed Virgin [Mary], who was "more free." They have the apostles for princes, who sought not the pleasures of this world, but will be rewarded, in due time, and eat without confusion. (T. 7.)

"Our branches are our desires, by which we stretch ourselves to the south, if they be spiritual," &c. (St. Bernard, ser. xlix.) The liberal are not concerned where they bestow charity.

intro:
  - INTRODUCTION.
  - 'This Book is called <i>Ecclesiastes,</i> or <i>the preacher,</i> (in Hebrew, <i>Coheleth</i>) because in it Solomon, as an excellent <i>preacher,</i> setteth forth the vanity of the things of this world, to withdraw the hearts and affections of men from such empty toys. (Challoner) --- Coheleth is a feminine noun, to indicate the elegance of the discourse. It is very difficult to discriminate the objections of free-thinkers from the real sentiments of the author. It is most generally supposed that Solomon wrote this after his repentance; but this is very uncertain. St. Jerome (in chap. xii. 12.) informs us that the collectors of the sacred books had some scruple about admitting this; and Luther speaks of it with great disrespect: (Coll. conviv.) but the Church has always maintained its authority. See Conc. v. Act. 4. Philast. 132. (Calmet) --- It refutes the false notions of worldlings, concerning felicity; and shews that it consists in the service of God and fruition. (Worthington)'
