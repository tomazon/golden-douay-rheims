    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'HOS:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Israel.</i> He reigned forty-one years, till the year of the world 3220. (Usher) --- The prophets usually give the date, that the prediction may be verified. Some Latin manuscripts intimate, that "the Jews attribute these titles to Esdras, (who is Malachias) or to the respective prophets, which is more probable." (St. Jerome, t. i.) --- Jeroboam II died twenty-six years before Ozias, towards the end of whose reign Isaias commenced; so that Osee was more ancient. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - "HOS:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Fornications.</i> That is, a wife that hath been given to fornication. This was to represent the Lord's proceedings with his people Israel, who, by spiritual fornication, were continually offending him. (Challoner) --- The prophet reclaimed her. (St. Jerome) --- She denoted Samaria, abandoned to idolatry, Ezechiel xvi. 15. Several such actions were prophetical. Many have supposed that this was only a parable; but the sequel proves the contrary. (Calmet) --- <i>Of fornications.</i> So called from the character of their mother, if not also from their own wicked dispositions. (Challoner) --- He is ordered to marry a woman who had been of a loose character, and to have children who would resemble her; (Worthington) or he takes her children to his house; (Grotius) unless the children of the prophet were so styled because the mother had been given to fornication. So the <i>rod</i> of Aaron retains its name when it was become a <i>serpent,</i> Exodus vii. 12. --- <i>Shall,</i> or rather, \"has departed;\" and therefore he denounces future chastisements."
      v:004:
        - "HOS:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Jezrahel.</i> Jehu slew Joram in this place. He was the instrument of God's justice, yet acted himself through malice and ambition, and was therefore deservedly punished. Zacharias, the fourth of his family, lost the crown, and was slain by Sellum, at Jezrahel, 4 Kings ix., &c. (Calmet) --- The offspring of Jehu, now on the throne, solicited Jezrahel or the ten tribes to idolatry, which God will revenge. (Worthington)"
      v:006:
        - 'HOS:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Without mercy. Lo Ruchamah.</i> (Challoner) --- Some copies of Septuagint and St. Paul read, "not beloved," Romans ix. 25. Samaria shall surely perish. After the death of Jeroboam II, the kingdom was all in confusion, and in sixty-two years time became extinct. It was afterwards blended with Juda.'
      v:007:
        - 'HOS:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Horsemen.</i> Sennacherib was miraculously disconcerted. Juda returned from captivity and became more flourishing, giving birth to the Messias. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - 'HOS:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Not my people. Lohammi.</i> (Challoner) --- The kingdom of Israel seemed to be quite cast off; and in captivity it was hardly distinguished from other nations. Juda was preserved longer, and at all times was under the divine protection. Ezechiel, Daniel, &c., comforted the people in the worst of their afflictions. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - 'HOS:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>The number,</i> &c., viz., of the true Israelites, the children of the Church of Christ. (Challoner) --- This is the primary sense, Romans ix. 25. Yet the Israelites are here also assured of their return from captivity. (Calmet) --- <i>God.</i> Among many sinners, some are chosen. (Worthington)'
      v:011:
        - 'HOS:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Head;</i> Christ, (Challoner) the head of all the faithful, (Worthington) consisting both of Jews and Gentiles. Israel and Juda returned under Zorobabel, &c. (Calmet) --- The prophets blend present and future transactions together. (St. Jerome in chap. iii.) --- <i>Jezrahel.</i> That is, of the seed of God; for Jezrahel signifies the seed of God. (Challoner) --- <i>For</i> may also be rendered, "when or though." The seed of Jehu shall be exterminated. The kingdom, signified by Jezrahel, a great city, shall fall. (Calmet)'

      v:001: 'HOS:1:1 | 1 | 1 | The {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}word of the Lord, that came to Osee, the son of Beeri, in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, <i>and</i> Ezechias, kings of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joas, king of Israel.'
      v:002: "HOS:1:2 | 2 | 2 | The beginning of the Lord's speaking by Osee: and the Lord said to Osee: Go, take thee a wife of fornications, and have of her children of fornications: for the land by fornication shall depart from the Lord."
      v:003: 'HOS:1:3 | 3 | 3 | So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Debelaim: and she conceived, and bore him a son.'
      v:004: 'HOS:1:4 | 4 | 4 | And the Lord said to him: Call his name Jezrahel: for yet a little while, and I will visit the blood of Jezrahel upon the house of Jehu, and I will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.'
      v:005: HOS:1:5 | 5 | 5 | And in that day I will break in pieces the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezrahel.
      v:006: 'HOS:1:6 | 6 | 6 | And she conceived again, and bore a daughter, and he said to him: Call her name, Without mercy: for I will not add any more to have mercy on the house of Israel, but I will utterly forget them.'
      v:007: 'HOS:1:7 | 7 | 7 | And I will have mercy on the house of Juda, and I will save them by the Lord, their God: and I will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by horsemen.'
      v:008: 'HOS:1:8 | 8 | 8 | And she weaned her that was <i>called</i> Without mercy. And she conceived, and bore a son.'
      v:009: 'HOS:1:9 | 9 | 9 | And he said: Call his name, Not my people: for you are not my people, and I will not be yours.'
      v:010: 'HOS:1:10 | 10 | 10 | And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, that is without measure, and shall not be numbered. {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And it shall be in the place where it shall be said to them: You are not my people: it shall be said to them: <i>Ye are</i> the sons of the living God.'
      v:011: 'HOS:1:11 | 11 | 11 | And the children of Juda, and the children of Israel, shall be gathered together: and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall come up out of the land: for great is the day of Jezrahel.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'HOS:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Brethren,</i> &c. Or, <i>call your brethren, My people; and your sister, Her that hath obtained mercy.</i> This is connected with the latter end of the foregoing chapter, and relates to the converts of Israel. (Challoner) --- I seemed to have abandoned them at <i>the great day</i> of carnage; (Haydock) but I will still receive (Calmet) this portion of my people, as well as Juda. (Haydock) --- Disdain not to call them brethren. More of the ten tribes than of the others embraced the faith of Christ, and more Gentiles than Jews became converts. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - "HOS:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Your mother:</i> the synagogue. (Calmet) --- He addresses Juda, (ver. 11, 15.) or all God's people, chap. i. 11. This vineyard yields no good fruit, Isaias v. Idolatry prevails, Ezechiel xvi. 5., and xxiii. 3."
      v:003:
        - 'HOS:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Drought.</i> In Egypt the people were plunged into idolatry, and oppressed. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - 'HOS:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Fornications.</i> They imitate their parents. (Haydock) --- I will not spare them, as I did some in the wilderness. (St. Jerome) --- Punishment will not cease till people repent. (Worthington)'
      v:005:
        - 'HOS:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Lovers:</i> idols, and foreign nations, Ezechiel xvi. 15, 33.'
      v:006:
        - 'HOS:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Paths.</i> The aid which she sought from foreigners shall prove vain. --- It is often an effect of mercy, when our wicked plans miscarry. (St. Jerome)'
      v:008:
        - HOS:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Baal:</i> or they formed idols.
      v:009:
        - 'HOS:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Season.</i> When the harvest is ripe, the loss is more afflicting. God withdraws what proves an occasion of sin. --- <i>Liberty.</i> The creature serves unwillingly, Romans viii. 21.'
      v:010:
        - 'HOS:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Folly,</i> or shame, Genesis xxxiv. 7., and Judges xix. 23.'
      v:011:
        - HOS:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Times.</i> This was verified during the captivity.
      v:013:
        - 'HOS:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Ear.</i> Hebrew, "nose-rings," or ornaments hanging from the nose. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - "HOS:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>I will allure her,</i> &c. After her disloyalties, I will still allure her by my grace, &c., and send her <i>vine-dressers,</i> viz., the apostles, originally her own children, who shall <i>open</i> to her the gates of <i>hope;</i> as heretofore, at her coming into the land of promise, she had all good success after she had satisfied the divine justice by the execution of Achan, in the valley of Achor, Josue vii. (Challoner) --- Septuagint, \"I will seduce <i>or</i> make her stray;\" {GREEK:START plano}πλανο{GREEK:END}. (Haydock) --- I will permit her to yield to error, in captivity; (Theodoret) or will cause her hopes to be frustrated yet in exile I will comfort her. The Jews were not changed till they had seen the vanity of idols, and suffered much. (Calmet) --- God's grace prevents sinners, that they may be converted. (Worthington)"
      v:015:
        - 'HOS:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Vine.</i> Hebrew, "vineyards there," (Calmet) or "from," &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Achor.</i> The environs of Jericho were very enchanting, Isaias lxv. 10. --- <i>Sing</i> is better than Septuagint, "shall be humbled." Hebrew, "shall answer," as people singing alternately. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'HOS:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>My husband.</i> In Hebrew <i>Ishi.</i> --- <i>Baali:</i> my lord. The meaning of this verse is: that, whereas, <i>Ishi</i> and <i>Baali</i> were used indifferently in those days by wives speaking to their husbands, the synagogue, whom God was pleased to consider as his spouse, should call him only <i>Ishi,</i> and abstain from the name of <i>Baali,</i> because of his affinity with the name of the idol <i>Baal.</i> (Challoner) --- The very name shall become obsolete. (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - 'HOS:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Baalim.</i> It is the plural number of Baal; for there were divers idols of Baal. (Challoner) --- The Jews hence styled Esbaal, Isboseth; as <i>boseth</i> means "confusion," 1 Paralipomenon viii. 33.'
      v:018:
        - 'HOS:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Beasts.</i> The most savage nations shall receive the gospel, and become mild, Isaias xi. 6. (Theodoret) --- Wild beasts shall not infest the land, Leviticus xxvi. 22. (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - 'HOS:2:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>I will espouse thee,</i> &c. This relates to the happy espousals of Christ with his Church, which shall never be dissolved. (Challoner) --- God gives the dowry, <i>justice,</i> &c.'
      v:020:
        - 'HOS:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Faith,</i> the root of all virtues. We shall be true to each other. This has been realized only in the Church of Christ. (Calmet)'

All shall conspire in favour of the Church, which in the following verse is called <i>Jezrahel,</i> that is, <i>the seed of God.</i> (Challoner) --- Harmony shall subsist between all the parts of the universe. The earth shall receive rain, &c. This happiness was enjoyed in figure by the Jews, after their return, and in reality by Christians. (Theodoret)'
      v:022:
        - HOS:2:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Jezrahel.</i> This most fruitful valley shall again be covered with abundant crops. The whole nation of the Jews shall be happy. (Calmet)
      v:024:
        - 'HOS:2:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>That which is not my people,</i> &c. This relates to the conversion of the Gentiles, (Challoner) as the apostles explain it, 1 Peter ii. 10., and Romans ix. (Worthington)'

      v:001:
        - 'HOS:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Woman.</i> This second woman denotes the penitent Israel, yet not quite reconciled. The people in captivity are separated both from her idols and from God, though the latter still retains an affection for them. Osee does not marry this woman, but gives his word. We must not urge the parable too far. He acts as a figure of the Lord, who has received an outrage. (Calmet) --- Grace is still offered to sinners, whose persons are never hated by God. (Worthington) --- <i>Husks.</i> Septuagint, &c., "cakes made with grapes," for idols. (Theodoret; St. Jerome)'
      v:002:
        - 'HOS:3:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Core.</i> Septuagint, "gomor of barley, and for a nebel of wine." The woman must consequently have been of very mean condition. In the East wives are still, even among Christians, purchased according to their rank, often without being seen or consulted. The parents give part of the price to the bride. (Calmet) --- The unbelieving Jews, who refrain from idols, receive some temporal advantages; but not thirty pieces of silver, or three cores of wheat, denoting the faith of the blessed Trinity and the observance of the decalogue, whereby they might obtain eternal life. Towards the end of the world they shall be converted. [Romans xi. 26.] (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - "HOS:3:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Man's.</i> After the person was espoused, any infidelity was punished as if she had been married. It does not appear that Osee took this woman to wife. (Calmet) --- But he signified that the people must wait for God, in captivity. (Theodoret; Sanctius lv.)"
      v:004:
        - 'HOS:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Altar.</i> Hebrew, "statue;" <i>matseba</i> instead of <i>mozbé,</i> as (Haydock) others agree with St. Jerome, and there seems to have been no variation in his time. --- <i>Theraphim.</i> Images or representations, (Challoner) either good or bad. As the other things mentioned were good, such lawful images as were used in the temple must be meant, 3 Kings vii. 36. (Worthington) --- St. Jerome explains it of cherubim. Septuagint, "altar, priesthood, and manifestations (<i>Urim,</i> &c.) being wanting." (Haydock) --- Yet some take it in a bad sense. The Jews adhere neither to God nor to idols. (Vatable, &c.) --- What misfortune, however, would the latter be? In exile the Jews were deprived of the exercise of their religion, and of their princes. (Calmet) --- But this was only a figure of what they endured since they rejected Christ. (Origen, Philoc. i.; St. Jerome) --- This wretched state will probably continue till they at last embrace the yoke of Christ, the true king of ages. (Calmet)'

        - 'HOS:3:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>David, their king.</i> That is, Christ, who is of the house of David. (Challoner) --- After the captivity, the Jews submitted to Zorobabel. Yet this only foreshewed a more sincere conversion to Jesus Christ. In fact, the house of David never regained the throne, (Calmet) and it is not clear that Zorobabel had any authority over the people. (Haydock) --- Christ is the literal object of this prediction.

        - "HOS:11:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Away.</i> The last kings of Israel lived in the midst of troubles. (Haydock) --- Osee, though one of the best, brought ruin on the nation. (Calmet) --- <i>Son:</i> Israel. But as the calling of Israel out of Egypt was a figure of the calling of Christ from thence; therefore this text is also applicable to Christ, as we learn from St. Matthew ii. 15. (Challoner) Julian pretends that the apostle has abused this text. But it speaks of both events. (St. Jerome) --- Eusebius (Dem. ix. 3.) thinks that St. Matthew refers to Balaam; (Numbers xxiv. 8.) and St. Jerome does not reject this opinion, (in Matthew ii.; Calmet) to avoid \"wrangling,\" though he repeatedly alleges this text as a proof his version being more accurate than that of the Septuagint, which has <i>his children.</i> This reading the best editions retain; so that it may seem a matter of surprise, that Fabricius should give this verse as a specimen of Origen's Hexapla, and still print <i>my son,</i> taking it, as he says, from the Barbarini copy, the London Polyglot, and Cave. Bib. Gr. iii. 12. The first column has the Hebrew text, and the second the same in Greek characters, &c. The reader may form a judgment of this work from the following specimen: 1. Hebrew (which we shall express) <i>karathi bani.</i> 2. Greek {GREEK:START karathi bani}καραθι βανι{GREEK:END}. 3. Aquila {GREEK:START ekalesa ton uion mou}ηκαλησα τον υιον μου{GREEK:END}. 4. Symmachus {GREEK:START kekletai uios mou}κηκληται υιοσ μου{GREEK:END}. 5. Septuagint {GREEK:START kekletai uios mou}κηκληται υιοσ μου{GREEK:END}. 6. Theodotion {GREEK:START kai ekalesa uion mou}και ηκαλησα υιον μου{GREEK:END}. If any other versions were added, to form Octapla, &c., they were placed after Theodotion, who, though prior to Symmachus, is placed after him, because his version was not so unlike that of the Septuagint, and the deficiencies were chiefly supplied from him. In the Roman and Alexandrian editions, instead of the above we find, {GREEK:START metekalesa ta tekna autou}μητηκαλησα τα τηκνα αυτου{GREEK:END}. \"I have recalled his children.\" (Haydock) --- This is literally spoken of Israel, (styled God's son, Exodus iv 23.) and mystically, (Worthington) though no less (Haydock) truly, of Jesus Christ, as the inspired evangelist shews.

Septuagint, "the house of Israel and Juda with impiety. Now God hath known them <i>lovingly,</i> and it shall be called the holy people of God." Thus both kingdoms were criminal, and God exercised his mercy towards both. (Haydock) --- The Jews relate that when their ancestors were pursued by the Egyptians, and the people were desponding, Juda signalized his courage by entering the bed of the sea. (St. Jerome) --- These traditions are suspicious. (Calmet)'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - '<b>Osee</b>, or Hosea, whose name signifies <i>a saviour,</i> was the first in the order of time among those who are commonly called <i>lesser prophets,</i> because their prophecies are short. He prophesied in the kingdom of Israel, (that is, of the ten tribes) about the same time that Isaias prophesied in the kingdom of Juda. (Challoner) --- The chronological order is not observed in any edition. The Septuagint vary from the rest. They place the less before the greater prophets, and read some of the names rather differently, as Protestants do also, though they have nothing but novelty to recommend the change. We shall here specify the Protestant names, (Haydock) in the order in which these prophets appeared: (Calmet) 1. Hosea, 2. Amos, 3. Jonah, 4. Micah, 5. Nahum, 6. Joel, 7. Zephaniah, 8. Habakkuk, 9. Obadiah, 10. Haggai, 11. Zechariah, 12. Malachi. (Haydock) --- It is not known who collected them into one volume. But the book of Ecclesiasticus (xlix. 12.) speaks of <i>the twelve;</i> and 4 Esdras i. 39., specifies them as they are found in the Septuagint: Osee, Amos, Micheas, Joel, Abdias, Jonas, Nahum, &c., as in the Vulgate. (Calmet) --- Many other prophets appeared before these, (Worthington) but Osee is the first of the sixteen whose works are extant. He must have continued his ministry about eighty-five years, and lived above one hundred and ten, if the first verse speak of him alone. But some take it to regard the whole collection, and may be added by another hand. (Calmet) --- The style of Osee is sententious and very hard to be understood, (St. Jerome) as but little is known of the last kings of Israel, in whose dominions he lived, and to whom he chiefly refers, though he speaks sometimes of Juda, &c. (Calmet) --- By taking a wife, and other parables, he shews their criminal conduct and chastisment, and foretells their future deliverance and the benefits to be conferred by Christ. We must observe that the prophets often style the kingdom of the two tribes, Juda, Benjamin, Jerusalem, or the house of David; and that of the ten tribes, Ephraim, Joseph, Samaria, Jezrahel, Bethel, or Bethaven; and often Israel or Jacob till after the captivity of these tribes, when the latter titles refer to Juda, who imitated the virtues of Jacob better than the other kingdom. (Worthington) --- Then all distinction of this nature was at an end. (Haydock)'
