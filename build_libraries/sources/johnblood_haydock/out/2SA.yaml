      v:001:
        - '2SA:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Siceleg,</i> though it had been burnt down. (Salien, the year of the world 2949.)'
      v:006:
        - '2SA:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Chance.</i> He feigned this to obtain the favour of David; but the king punished him as he deserved. (Worthington) --- <i>Spear,</i> or sword, as it is before expressed. (Menochius)'
      v:008:
        - '2SA:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Amalecite.</i> The Rabbins say he was the son of Doeg; and has this appellation because Amalec sprung from Esau, Genesis xxxvi. 12. But this is all very uncertain. The man seems to have gotten possession of the marks of the royal dignity in the night, as the Philistines deferred till the next day stripping the bodies of the deceased. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - '2SA:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Anguish.</i> Hebrew, "the coat of mail withholds me." Septuagint, "horrid darkness encompasses me." <i>Shabah,</i> signifies a coat of mail, made of cloth, very thick, and boiled in vinegar, to render it more impenetrable. The Greeks emperors and the French formerly wore them much, instead of iron. (Calmet) --- Protestants however agrees with us. --- <i>In me.</i> I have yet received no mortal wound. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - '2SA:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>I killed him.</i> This story of the young Amalecite was not true, as may easily be proved by comparing it with the last chapter of the foregoing book. (Challoner) --- <i>Fall.</i> This he says, apprehending that David would perhaps disapprove of what he had done. --- <i>Diadem,</i> or ribband, which was tied round his head, as a badge of his dignity. Hebrew, "the crown." But it was not of metal, though such were already common, Exodus xxviii. 36., and 1 Paralipomenon xx. 2. Some pretend that Doeg gave these insignia to this son, that he might ingratiate himself with the future king. But they were upon Saul, so that the enemy could easily distinguish him. --- <i>Bracelet.</i> The Hebrews took a great many from the Madianites, Numbers xxxi. 50. Such presents were made by the Romans to soldiers who had performed some feats of valour. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxiii. 2.) (Livy i. 10.)'
      v:011:
        - '2SA:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Rent them,</i> in sign of grief, as many other nations did.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Tum pius Æneas humeris abscindere vestem.</i> (Virgil, Æneid v.) (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - '2SA:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Of the Lord,</i> the priests; (Abulensis) though it seems to be explained by the following words, of all the Israelites. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - '2SA:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Stranger,</i> residing among the Hebrews.'
      v:016:
        - '2SA:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Head.</i> None but thyself can be answerable for thy death. See Matthew xxvii. 25. David was already supreme magistrate, and he wished that all should be convinced that he rejoiced not at the death of the king, and that none might imitate the example of this wretch. (Calmet) --- Thus Vitellius punished the murderers of Galba, "not out of respect to Galba; but, according to the custom of princes, as a protection for the present, and a threat of vengeance for the future," in case any should dare to treat him in like manner. (Tacitus i.) <i>Tradito principibus more, munimentum in præsens, in posterum ultionem.</i>'
      v:018:
        - "2SA:1:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Bow.</i> So this canticle was entitled, because it spoke in praise of the bow and arrows of Saul and Jonathan, ver. 22. So one of the works of Hesiod is called \"a buckler;\" of Theocritus \"a flute;\" of Simmias \"a wing;\" &c. Septuagint have neglected this word entirely (Calmet) in the Roman edition. But it is found in the Alexandrian copy, which reads \"Israel,\" instead of <i>Juda,</i> perhaps properly. (Grabe, prol. iv. 2.) (Haydock) --- Chaldean, \"to shoot with the bow.\" Many suppose that David cautioned his men to exert themselves in that art, (Menochius) as they might soon expect to have to encounter the Philistines, (Tirinus) who were very expert bowmen. (Worthington) --- But the former interpretation seems preferable. (Calmet) --- The bow might be also the beginning of some favourite song, to the tune of which (Du Hamel) David would have his men to sing this canticle, (Haydock) particularly when they went to battle. (Grotius) --- <i>Just.</i> See Josue x. 3. (Menochius) --- It seems this was a more ancient record, to which the author of this book refers. (Calmet) --- He might have in view the canticle of Anna, (1 Kings ii. 4,) or some other. (Haydock) --- The custom of composing canticles, on such solemn occasions, is very ancient and frequent. See 3 Kings iii. 33., and xiii. 29., and Jeremias xlviii. 31. (Homer, Iliad {GREEK:START ps}ψ{GREEK:END} & {GREEK:START ch}χ{GREEK:END}) The style of this piece can hardly be equalled by the most polite writers. (Calmet) --- David is chiefly occupied with the praises of Jonathan. (Haydock) --- <i>Consider....places.</i> This sentence is omitted in Hebrew, Chaldean, Septuagint, and in some copies of St. Jerome's version. (T. i. p. 365, Nov. edit. op.) It is a farther explication of the subsequent verse. (Calmet) --- Yet the Septuagint read, \"Erect a pillar, O Israel, [upon thy heights; the Vatican Septuagint places this after <i>slain.</i> (Haydock)] in honour of the slain, thy wounded <i>soldiers.</i> How are the mighty fallen?\" The Hebrew seems to be different from what the Septuagint, Chaldean, &c., read, as the Masora now adopts <i>etsbi,</i> instead of <i>etsib,</i> which has greatly puzzled interpreters. Hence Aquila translates {GREEK:START akriboson}ακριβοσον{GREEK:END}, with the Septuagint of Ximenes, i.e., \"Execute <i>or</i> consider with attention,\" this sepulchral monument on which you shall inscribe, \"For the dead <i>and</i> for thy wounded.\" It was to be placed on some \"eminence,\" according to custom. The present Hebrew is very indeterminate, denoting \"glory, a honey-comb,\" &c., Ezechiel xx. 6., and Daniel xi. 16, 41. See Grabe, Prol. (Haydock)"
      v:019:
        - "2SA:1:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Illustrious.</i> Hebrew, \"the glory (beauty, hart, &c.) of Israel hath been pierced,\" &c. The comparison of Saul with a hart, is noble enough in the ideas of the ancients, Psalm xvii. 34., Canticle of Canticles ii. 9., and viii. 14. Syriac and Arabic, \"O hart of Israel, they have been slain,\" &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Slain.</i> Hebrew <i>chalal,</i> signifies also \"a soldier;\" and this word agrees perfectly well with <i>giborim,</i> \"valiant,\" both here and ver. 22 and 25. Kennicott would apply it to Jonathan, upon whom David's attention is mostly fixed. \"O ornament of Israel! O warrior, upon thy high places! <i>How,</i>\" &c. (Haydock) --- In this manner many such pieces commence, Lamentations i. (Tirinus)"
      v:020:
        - 2SA:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Triumph.</i> He was aware of the exultation of the infidels. (Haydock)
      v:021:
        - '2SA:1:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Fruits,</i> which may be offered to the Lord. Inanimate things could not offend, nor does David curse them in earnest. But (Tirinus) nothing could more strikingly express his distress and grief, than this imprecation. It is false that those mountains have since been barren. This canton is one of the most fruitful of the country. (Brochard.) (Calmet) --- Job (iii.) speaks with the same animation, and curses his day. (Menochius) --- <i>Of Saul,</i> or "Saul, the shield of his people, was cast away, as," &c. Protestants, "<i>as though he had</i> not <i>been</i> anointed with oil." (Haydock) --- He is not reproached for throwing away his buckler, for nothing was deemed more shameful. The ancient Germans would not allow such a one to enter their temples or places of assembly. (Tacitus, mor. Germ) --- A woman of Sparta told her son, when she delivered one to him, "Bring this back, or be brought upon it" dead. <i>Impositu scuto referunt Pallanta frequentes.</i> (Virgil, Æneid x.) (Sanctius) (Calmet) --- <i>As though.</i> Hebrew seems to have <i>sh,</i> instead of <i>s,</i> (as it is in several manuscripts correctly, in <i>noshug</i>) and <i>bli,</i> instead of <i>cli,</i> (Delany) as the former word seems no where else to signify <i>quasi non;</i> and the Syriac, Arabic, and Chaldean omit the negation. It might therefore be <i>the shield of Saul,</i> "the arms of him who has been anointed with oil." (Kennicott) --- Some would refer this unction to the shield, (Vatable) as this was some times done: (Menochius) but the reflection would be here too trifling. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - '2SA:1:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>From.</i> Hebrew, "without the blood of soldiers, without the fat of the valiant, the bow of Jonathan had never returned." (Kennicott) --- <i>Fat.</i> The entrails. It might also denote the most valiant of the soldiers, as we read of "the fat or marrow of corn" for the best, Psalm lxxx. 17. (Calmet) --- Jonathan attacked the most courageous, and laid them dead at his feet. (Haydock) --- <i>Empty.</i> Saul carried destruction wherever he went.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Et nos tela, pater, ferrumque haud debile dextra,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Spargimus & nostro sequitur de vulnere sanguis.</i> (Virgil, Æneid xii. 50.)'
      v:023:
        - "2SA:1:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Lovely,</i> or united. Jonathan always behaved with due respect towards his father, though he could not enter into his unjust animosity against David. (Calmet) --- The latter passes over in silence all that Saul had done against himself, and seems wholly occupied with the thought of the valour and great achievements of the deceased. (Haydock) --- Sanchez believes that these epithets were introduced of course into funeral canticles, like <i>Alas! my noble one,</i> (Jeremias xxii. 18.; Menochius) as Saul could have no pretensions to be styled lovely, or friendly, towards the latter part of his reign; since he treated the priests, David, and even his son Jonathan, with contumely, and even with unrelenting fury. But all this David would willingly bury in oblivion. He will not even notice how different was the end of the two heroes. Jonathan died like a virtuous soldier in his country's cause; Saul was wounded, but impiously accelerated his own death, through dread of torments and of insult. Though they died, therefore, on the same field of battle, their end was as different as that of the saint and of the impenitent sinner. (Haydock)"
      v:025:
        - '2SA:1:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Battle.</i> Hebrew, "in the midst of battle! O Jonathan, thou warrior upon thy high places!" (Kennicott, Diss. i. p. 123.)'
      v:026:
        - '2SA:1:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Brother.</i> So they lamented, <i>Alas! my brother,</i> Jeremias xxii. 18. (Menochius)'
      v:027:
        - "2SA:1:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Perished,</i> falling into the hands of the enemy; though Saul and Jonathan may be styled the arms, as well as the shield, of Israel. (Menochius) --- No character could be more worthy of praise than the latter. His breast was never agitated by envy, though he seemed to be the most interested to destroy David. Even Saul had many excellent qualities; which makes Ven. Bede compare him in those respects with Jesus Christ; as most of the memorable persons and events of the Old Testament had a view to Christ on the one hand, and to the Synagogue on the other. Saul is one of the most striking figures of the reprobation and conduct of the Jewish church. As he was adorned with many glorious prerogatives, and chosen by God, yet he no sooner beheld the rising merit of David, than he began to persecute him: so the Jews had been instructed by the prophets, and had been selected as God's peculiar inheritance; and nevertheless took occasion from the virtues and miracles of the Son of God, to conspire his ruin. The Romans were sent to punish the Jews, who are now become the most abject of all mankind, and are filled with rage, seeing the exaltation of the Christian Church, as Saul was reduced by the Philistines to the greatest distress, and his children were forced to implore the protection of the man whom he had so cruelly persecuted, &c. (Calmet) --- Saul and Judas may be a warning to us, that no person ought to live without fear, since they perished so miserably, though they had been elevated by the hand of God. (St. Ambrose, &c.) (Haydock)"

      v:002: "2SA:1:2 | 2 | 2 | And on the third day, there appeared a man who came out of Saul's camp, with his garments rent, and dust strewed on his head: and when he came to David, he fell upon his face, and adored."

      v:009: '2SA:1:9 | 9 | 9 | And he said to me: Stand over me, and kill me: for anguish is come upon me, and as yet my whole life is in me.'
      v:010: '2SA:1:10 | 10 | 10 | So standing over him, I killed him: for I knew that he could not live after the fall: and I took the diadem that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought <i>them</i> hither to thee, my lord.'
      v:011: '2SA:1:11 | 11 | 11 | Then David took hold of his garments and rent them, and likewise all the men that were with him:'
      v:012: '2SA:1:12 | 12 | 12 | And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan, his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword.'
      v:013: '2SA:1:13 | 13 | 13 | And David said to the young man that told him: Whence art thou? He answered: I am the son of a stranger of Amalec.'

      v:018: '2SA:1:18 | 18 | 18 | (Also he commanded that they should teach the children of Juda the use of the bow, as it is written in the Book of the just.) And he said: Consider, O Israel, for them that are dead, wounded on thy high places.'
      v:019: '2SA:1:19 | 19 | 19 | The illustrious of Israel are slain upon thy mountains: how are the valiant fallen?'
      v:020: '2SA:1:20 | 20 | 20 | Tell it not in Geth, publish it not in the streets of Ascalon: lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.'
      v:021: '2SA:1:21 | 21 | 21 | Ye mountains of Gelboe, let neither dew nor rain come upon you, nor let there be in you fields of first-fruits: for there was cast away the shield of the valiant, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '2SA:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Juda.</i> David thought it was his duty to co-operate with the designs of Providence. He consults the Lord (Calmet) by means of Abiathar, (Abulensis) or by a prophet. (Josephus) --- <i>Hebron,</i> ennobled by the patriarchs. (Menochius) --- It was also in the centre of Juda, and the strongest place belonging to that tribe. (Calmet) --- Part of Jerusalem was still in the hands of the Jebusites. (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - '2SA:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Towns,</i> villages, and dependencies <i>of Hebron.</i>'
      v:004:
        - '2SA:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Juda,</i> without the concurrence of the other tribes, (Calmet) which would be an evil precedent in a commonwealth, unless God had authorized them by the declaration of his will. (Grotius) --- Samuel had before anointed David, and given him a right to the crown, (Worthington) <i>jus ad regnum.</i> But this anointing gives him a right to govern, <i>jus in regno;</i> (Calmet) or rather it proves, that the tribe submitted voluntarily to his dominion, which he had already (Haydock) lawfully begun to exercise, when he put the Amalecite to death. (Abulensis) (Tirinus) --- <i>Told,</i> perhaps by some ill-designing men, who wished to irritate David against those who had shewn an attachment to Saul, unless the king had made enquiry, thinking it his duty to bury the deceased. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - '2SA:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>And truth,</i> or a real kindness. God will reward you for the sincere piety which you have shewn towards the dead. (Calmet) --- <i>Will.</i> I do, by these messengers, thank you. (Louis de Dieu)'
      v:007:
        - '2SA:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>King.</i> He invites them to concur with the men of Juda, hoping that all Israel would be influenced by their example. But his hopes proved abortive, as Abner caused Isboseth to be proclaimed king in the vicinity at Mahanaim.'
      v:008:
        - "2SA:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Camp.</i> Hebrew <i>Machanayim,</i> which many take for a proper name (Calmet) of the town, on the river Jabok, where Jacob had encamped, Genesis xxxii. 2. (Haydock) --- Abner was aware that he should not retain his authority under David, and therefore conducted Isboseth to the camps in various places, (Menochius) but chiefly on the east side of the Jordan, (Haydock; ver. 29.) where the people were particularly attached to Saul's family. Isboseth seems to have been a fit tool for his purpose."
      v:009:
        - "2SA:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Gessuri.</i> There was one south of Juda: but this country was probably near Hermon, and might be tributary to Israel. David perhaps married this king's daughter, in order to detach him from the party of Isboseth, chap. iii. 3. Hebrew reads, \"Assuri;\" and St. Jerome observes, that many explained it of the tribe of Aser, (Trad. Heb.[Hebrew tradition?]) with the Chaldee, (Du Hamel; Menochius) or of the Assurians, Genesis xxv. 3. --- <i>Israel,</i> by degrees. In the mean time the Philistines occupied many cities, which might prevent Isboseth from attempting to fix his residence on the west side of the Jordan, ver. 19."
      v:010:
        - "2SA:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>He reigned two years,</i> viz., before he began visibly to decline: but in all he reigned seven years and six months: for so long David reigned in Hebron. (Challoner) (Worthington) --- The Jews admit of an interregnum in Israel of above five years, which is by no means probable. Two years elapsed before the two houses came to an open war; (Salien) soon after which, the power of Isboseth was greatly weakened by the defeat, and afterwards by the defection, of Abner. (Haydock) --- Hence the sacred historian refers to the commencement of hostilities, and not to the end of Isboseth's dominion. (Estius; Tirinus; Calmet)"
      v:012:
        - '2SA:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Servants;</i> guards, army. (Menochius) --- <i>Camp;</i> or from Machanayim to <i>Gabaon,</i> in the tribe of Benjamin, about six miles from Jerusalem. (Calmet) --- Septuagint leave the former word untranslated, "Manaeim." (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - '2SA:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Play,</i> like the gladiators with drawn swords, which formed one of the principal diversions at Rome, (Calmet) while it was pagan. This might be considered as a prelude to the ensuing engagement; or like a detachment of twelve on each side, fighting to shew the prowess of their respective armies; as the three Horatii and Curiatii did afterwards, to spare the effusion of blood. But there is no mention that Abner and Joab had authority to agree that these champions should decide the fate of the two kingdoms, (Haydock) whence they are generally accused of ostentation; though the soldiers, not being acquainted with their motives, were obliged to obey. (Tirinus; Menochius)'
      v:016:
        - "2SA:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Together.</i> Some understand this only of Abner's soldiers, as the original may be explained: \"And they (David's men) caught every on one his,\" &c. But it is more generally believed that all fell. (Calmet) --- Rufin has erroneously translated Josephus in the former sense, and has lead Comestor, Lyranus, &c., into this opinion. (Tirinus) --- <i>Valiant.</i> Hebrew, \"the portion of the smooth stones, (<i>hatsurim,</i> 1 Kings xvii. 40. <i>or</i>) of the brave.\" (Calmet)"
      v:018:
        - '2SA:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Woods.</i> Swiftness was one great qualification of a warrior, chap. i. 23. Homer generally styles Achilles, "the swift-footed."'
      v:021:
        - 2SA:2:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Spoils.</i> Attack one who may be a more equal match for thee. (Haydock)
      v:022:
        - '2SA:2:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Brother.</i> It seems they were great friends, though they had espoused different parties. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - '2SA:2:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Stroke,</i> (<i>aversa.</i>) Hebrew, "with the hinder end of the spear, under the fifth <i>rib.</i>" Septuagint, "in the loin."'
      v:024:
        - '2SA:2:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Wilderness,</i> or land which was not ploughed, though fruitful.'
      v:026:
        - '2SA:2:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Destruction.</i> Septuagint, "till <em>thou hast gained</em> a <em>complete</em> victory?" Chaldean, "to separation?" Must we come to an eternal rupture? --- <i>Despair?</i> Hebrew, "that it will be bitterness in the end?" Abner insinuates that they had commenced in a sort of play, but the consequences had already proved too serious; and if Joab continued to pursue, his men would be rendered desperate. (Calmet) --- Despair makes people perform wonders, to revenge themselves. (Menochius)'
      v:027:
        - '2SA:2:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Sooner.</i> Hebrew, "If thou hadst not spoken," (Du Hamel) by challenging, ver. 14. (Josephus, &c.) (Calmet)'
      v:028:

      v:007: '2SA:2:7 | 7 | 7 | Let your hands be strengthened, and be ye men of valour: for although your master, Saul, be dead, yet the house of Juda hath anointed me to be their king.'

      v:013: '2SA:2:13 | 13 | 13 | And Joab, the son of Sarvia, and the servants of David went out, and met them by the pool of Gabaon. And when they were come together, they sat down over-against one another: the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side.'

      v:021: '2SA:2:21 | 21 | 21 | And Abner said to him: Go to the right hand, or to the left, and lay hold on one of the young men, and take thee his spoils. But Asael would not leave off following him close.'
      v:022: '2SA:2:22 | 22 | 22 | And again Abner said to Asael: Go off, and do not follow me, lest I be obliged to stab thee to the ground, and I shall not be able to hold up my face to Joab, thy brother.'
      v:023: '2SA:2:23 | 23 | 23 | But he refused to hearken to him, and would not turn aside: wherefore Abner struck him with his spear, with a back stroke in the groin, and thrust him through, and he died upon the spot: and all that came to the place where Asael fell down and died, stood still.'
      v:024: '2SA:2:24 | 24 | 24 | Now while Joab and Abisai pursued after Abner, the sun went down: and they came as far as the hill of the aqueduct, that lieth over-against the valley, by the way of the wilderness in Gabaon.'

      v:027: '2SA:2:27 | 27 | 27 | And Joab said: As the Lord liveth, if thou hadst spoke sooner, <i>even</i> in the morning the people should have retired from pursuing after their brethren.'

(Haydock) --- Others, "Abia." --- <i>Gessur,</i> not far from Damascus. The lady probably first embraced the true religion, though the Scripture seldom enters into these details. (Calmet) --- David is never blamed for marrying strange women. Salien supposes that he entered into this alliance before the civil war broke out, that Isboseth, who had fixed his court at Mahanaim, might have an opponent near at hand. The fruits of this marriage were very unfortunate, and brought great distress upon David: so little do men know what will be the event of the most splendid connections! (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - '2SA:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Adonias</i> was slain by Solomon, (3 Kings ii. 24.; Menochius) for arrogating to himself the right of the first-born, and pretending that the crown belonged to him. (Haydock) --- The names of his mother, and of those who follow, are barely known. (Salien)'

The Rabbins would infer that Egla and Michol are the same person. But the latter had no children, (chap. vi. 23.; Salien) and is mentioned [in] ver. 13.'
      v:008:
        - "2SA:3:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Concubine.</i> To marry the king's widow was deemed an attempt upon the throne, 3 Kings ii. 22. Hence Solomon was so displeased at Adonias, ver. 24. Some think that Isboseth formed the accusation on mere conjecture; but Abner does not deny the fact. (Calmet) --- <i>Dog's head:</i> of no account, like a dead dog; (Haydock) or no better than a servant, who leads a dog. The Jews considered the dog as one of the vilest of animals, chap. ix. 8., and Job xxx. 1. --- <i>Juda.</i> This word is neglected by the Septuagint. Some would substitute <i>Liduth,</i> \"to be cast away.\" (Calmet) --- God permits the defenders of a wrong cause to fall out, that the right one may be advanced. (Worthington)"

      v:013:
        - '2SA:3:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Thee.</i> Could David thus authorize treachery? It is answered, that Abner knew that the throne belonged to him, and he was already responsible for all the evils of the civil war. David does not approve of his conduct, but only makes use of him to obtain his right. --- <i>Michol.</i> He might justly think that the people would have less repugnance to acknowledge him for their sovereign, when they saw that he had married the daughter of Saul. She had never been repudiated by him. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - '2SA:3:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Isboseth.</i> Thus he would screen the perfidy of Abner, (Menochius) and hinder him from using any violence.

(Salien) --- This was given out as the pretext of the murder; but envy seems to have been the chief promoter. (Menochius) --- Joab treated Amasa in the same manner, chap. xx. 10. Ambition was his god. (Calmet) --- Abisai was ready to assist him to murder Abner, ver. 30. Thus the fairest prospects of union seemed to vanish, and David was sincerely grieved, as he manifested in the most decided manner, confessing it was only the want of power which prevented him from bringing these merciless and potent brothers, his own nephews, to immediate punishment, ver. 39. (Haydock)"

Some translate a stick, with which the blind, lame and aged endeavour to walk. (Calmet) --- Any of these conditions would be very mortifying to great warriors. (Haydock) --- <i>Bread.</i> Hunger and famine were considered as a scourge of God, Psalm lviii. 7, 15., and cviii. 10.

(Calmet) --- The tribe is Issachar is not specified in the text; but Josephus asserts, that 20,000 of them assembled; so that the army would amount to 359 (Salien) or 60[360?] thousand, besides the 822. (Calmet) --- These might be considered as deputies of all the rest of their brethren, 1 Paralipomenon xii. 38. They were abundantly supplied with all necessities. (Salien) --- <i>Flesh,</i> of the same nation, as Moses had specified, Deuteronomy xvii. 15. (Calmet) --- They now relinquish all the seeds of division, which had before hindered them from joining with their brethren of Juda.

(Calmet) --- David had erected here a temporary altar and tabernacle, where Abiathar officiated in his pontifical robes, as it was not safe for the people to go into the dominions of Isboseth, either to Gabaon or to Cariathiarim.

(Hugo of Vienna) --- Thus Babylon was taken by Cyrus, who passed through the channel of the Euphrates, the waters of which he had let out; though the inhabitants had derided his attempt to take the city by siege, as the men of Jebus do here. Polybius says, \"Rabatamana, a city of Arabia, could not be taken, till one of the prisoners shewed the besiegers a subterraneous passage, ({GREEK:START uponomon}υπονωον{GREEK:END}) through which the besieged came down for water.\" Of the same nature were the gutters here spoken of. (Kennicott) --- \"The king promised to give the command of the army to the man who would pass through the cavities ({GREEK:START pharaggon}φαραγγον{GREEK:END}) below, and take the citadel.\" (Josephus) --- This reward is expressly mentioned in 1 Paralipomenon xi. 6, with the person who obtained it; (St. Jerome, Trad.) and it seems, after <i>David,</i> this ought to be inserted, \"shall be the head and captain. And Joab, the son of Sarvia, went up first, and was made the general.\" (Haydock) ---<i>Hatred.</i> Hebrew, \"that are hated by David's soul.\" Cajetan supposes that the Jebusites in the citadel, are thus distinguished from those who dwelt peaceably in the lower town, with the Israelites. (Calmet) --- <i>Proverb.</i> Protestants insert, \"<i>He shall be head and captain.</i> Wherefore they said, the blind....into the house.\" What is translated <i>temple,</i> may denote also, \"the house\" of David, or \"the place\" where this provocation had been given. (Haydock) --- Idols shall never be adored in the true Church. (Worthington) --- Some think that the blind and the lame were excluded from the temple, or from David's palace. But we find that they had free access to the temple; (Matthew xxi. 14., and Acts iii. 2.) and Miphiboseth ate at David's table, though he was lame. If the Jebusites be designated, they were already excluded from the temple, like other infidels of Chanaan. (Calmet) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] vii. 3.) insinuates, that \"David drove them from Jerusalem,\" though we read of Areuna residing there, chap. xxiv.16. But he might be a proselyte before, and not dwell in the fort. The expression seems however to be proverbial, to signify any very difficult enterprize, which proves successful, and contrary to expectation. (Haydock) --- The Jebusites were thus derided (Sanctius) in their turn. (Tirinus) --- Whether Joab took this strong place by a subterraneous passage, (Haydock) or scaled the walls, and so got to the top, whence the water falls, as from a gutter; (Calmet) it is certain that he displayed the utmost valour, and thus obtained the confirmation of his authority, which David would perhaps have willingly taken from him, (Salien) if another had offered himself, and performed this hazardous enterprize. (Haydock) --- He made a fair offer to all Israel, as they probably expected. (Kennicott)"

        - '2SA:5:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Inwards.</i> He built or repaired the higher "city of David," beginning at <i>Mello,</i> to "fill up" the valley, which Solomon finished, and adorned with a palace, 3 Kings ix. 15., and 4 Kings xii. 20. The place is probably called Asaramel, 1 Machabees xiv. 27. (Calmet) --- Septuagint and Josephus generally understand Mello to designate the citadel of Sion, or "a complete fortification," to defend the city. Instead of <i>inwards,</i> the Septuagint have, "and his house." But <i>ubithe</i> means, "and to the house," temple, or fort, whence he began the enclosure, so as to make a complete communication. (Kennicott) --- This city became "the most famous in all the East." (Pliny, [Natural History?] v. 14.) --- "Walls, built in a crooked manner, according to the rules of art, enclosed two hills, immensely high." (Tacitus, Hist. v.) --- These hills were multiplied, on account of their different summits, so that Josephus speaks of five hills. The palace of David stood on Sion, and the temple on Moria, which was a part of it still more elevated, towards the east. The other hill is often called Acra, by Josephus, and lay southward of Sion. Here the ancient town of Jebus was built. The Machabees took in an adjoining eminence. (Josephus, Jewish Wars vi. 6.) --- Bethsetta, or the new city, was afterwards enclosed. Herod adorned the city with many superb monuments, both of a public and of a private nature. (Calmet) --- We read of ten gates, and of four towers, belonging to this city. It was not well supplied with water, and what it had was brackish. The walls seem never to have exceeded four and a half miles; now they are only three, and include Mount Calvary, which was formerly no part of the city. Button says a valley run from west to east, between the two hills of Zion on the south, and Acra on the north; which contradicts the former statement. (Haydock) --- Villalpand supposes that the citadel was nine and a half stadia, and all the city thirty-five stadia in circumference, eight of which make an Italian mile. (Menochius)'

He might desire to attach the principal families of the nation, as well as some foreign princes, to his interests. Moses forbids a king to have too many wives, Deuteronomy xvii. 17. (Calmet) --- But David is never blamed for the transgression of this precept. See chap. iii. 1. (Menochius)'
      v:016:
        - '2SA:5:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Eliphaleth.</i> Septuagint reckon twenty instead of eleven.

But it was secure enough. (Haydock) --- On this occasion, three of his brave men went through the midst of the enemies' ranks, to fetch water from the spring of Bethlehem, chap. xxiii. 16."

Septuagint seem to give a double version: "the sound of the agitation (or Alexandrian, "shutting up," (Haydock) as with an army on all sides) of the <i>woods,</i> of the <i>lamentation.</i>" (Menochius) --- Theodoret supposes, "the woods put in motion, without any wind." It is thought that an army of spirits went before David, and threw the enemy into a panic. Storms of hail, &c., seem to have also cut them down, Isaias xxviii. 21., and Psalm xvii. 9.'

      v:001: '2SA:5:1 | 1 | 1 | Then all the tribes of Israel came to David, in Hebron, saying: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Behold we are thy bone and thy flesh.'
      v:002: '2SA:5:2 | 2 | 2 | Moreover yesterday also and the day before, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that did lead out and bring in Israel: and the Lord said to thee: Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.'
      v:003: '2SA:5:3 | 3 | 3 | The ancients also of Israel came to the king, to Hebron, and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and they anointed David to be king over Israel.'
      v:004: '2SA:5:4 | 4 | 4 | David was thirty years old when he began to reign, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and he reigned forty years.'
      v:005: '2SA:5:5 | 5 | 5 | In Hebron he reigned over Juda seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned three and thirty years over all Israel and Juda.'
      v:006: '2SA:5:6 | 6 | 6 | And the king and all the men that were with him went to Jerusalem, to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: and they said to David: Thou shalt not come in hither, unless thou take away the blind and the lame, that say David shall not come in hither.'
      v:007: '2SA:5:7 | 7 | 7 | But David took the castle of Sion: the same is the city of David.'
      v:008: '2SA:5:8 | 8 | 8 | For David had offered that day a reward to whosoever should strike the Jebusites, and get up to the gutters of the tops of the houses, and take away the blind and the lame that hated the soul of David: Therefore it is said in the proverb: The blind and the lame shall not come into the temple.'
      v:009: '2SA:5:9 | 9 | 9 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And David dwelt in the castle, and called it, The city of David: and built round about from Mello and inwards.'
      v:010: 2SA:5:10 | 10 | 10 | And he went on prospering and growing up; and the Lord God of hosts was with him.
      v:011: '2SA:5:11 | 11 | 11 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons for walls: and they built a house for David.'
      v:012: '2SA:5:12 | 12 | 12 | And David knew that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom over his people Israel.'
      v:013: '2SA:5:13 | 13 | 13 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And David took more concubines and wives of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were born to David other sons also and daughters:'
      v:014: '2SA:5:14 | 14 | 14 | And these are the names of them that were born to him in Jerusalem, Samua, and Sobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,'
      v:015: '2SA:5:15 | 15 | 15 | And Jebahar, and Elisua, and Nepheg,'
      v:016: '2SA:5:16 | 16 | 16 | And Japhia, and Elisama, and Elioda, and Eliphaleth.'
      v:017: '2SA:5:17 | 17 | 17 | And the Philistines heard that they had anointed David to be king over Israel: and they all came to seek David: and when David heard of it, he went down to a strong hold.'
      v:018: '2SA:5:18 | 18 | 18 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And the Philistines coming, spread themselves in the valley of Raphaim.'
      v:019: '2SA:5:19 | 19 | 19 | And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go up to the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said to David: Go up, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into thy hand.'
      v:020: '2SA:5:20 | 20 | 20 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And David came to Baal Pharisim: and defeated them there, and he said: The Lord hath divided my enemies before me, as waters are divided. {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 1}Therefore the name of the place was called Baal Pharisim.'
      v:021: '2SA:5:21 | 21 | 21 | And they left there their idols: which David and his men took away.'
      v:022: '2SA:5:22 | 22 | 22 | And the Philistines came up again, and spread themselves in the valley of Raphaim.'
      v:023: '2SA:5:23 | 23 | 23 | And David consulted the Lord: Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into my hands? He answered: Go not up against them, but fetch a compass behind them, and thou shalt come upon them over-against the pear trees.'
      v:024: '2SA:5:24 | 24 | 24 | And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the tops of the pear trees, then shalt thou join battle: for then will the Lord go out before thy face, to strike the army of the Philistines.'
      v:025: '2SA:5:25 | 25 | 25 | And David did as the Lord had commanded him, and he smote the Philistines from Gabaa, until thou come to Gezer.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '2SA:6:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Again,</i> after he had been anointed. David consulted his officers, &c., (1 Paralipomenon xiii. 1.) and called a numerous assembly of the priests and people to meet him at Cariathiarim. --- <i>Thousand,</i> in arms, to protect the rest, (Calmet) who might probably amount to 300,000. (Haydock) --- This number Capel and Grotius would substitute for the one here mentioned. Some copies of the Septuagint read 70,000. In the former assembly, there were 340, or 359, (Calmet) or 60 thousand, chap. v. 1. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - '2SA:6:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Juda.</i> But why are not the other tribes mentioned? and whither did they go? We should probably translate, "from the city of Baalim, in Juda;" which is another name of Cariathiarim, as the Paralipomenon intimate, [1 Paralipomenon xiii.?] ver. 6. See Josue xv. 9, 60. --- <i>Invoked;</i> or which is called "the ark of the Lord."'
      v:003:
        - '2SA:6:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Cart,</i> out of respect, as the Philistines had done, 1 Kings vi. 7. But God had ordered the Levites to carry it themselves, and the neglect here proved so dreadful; for which reason, David required the priests to attend when he removed the ark from the house of Obededom, 1 Paralipomenon xv. 12. --- <i>Gabaa</i> means "the hill of Cariathiarim," where the ark had been in the house of Abinadab, from the time of its being restored back by the Philistines. (Challoner) --- Hunnius would multiply the places where the ark was fixed, to show, against Catholics, that the Church is not confined to one place; (Amama) as if Catholic did not maintain the universality of the Church! (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - '2SA:6:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Wood.</i> Hebrew specifies "fir wood," of which the instruments were, perhaps, usually made.'
      v:006:
        - '2SA:6:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Nachon.</i> 1 Paralipomenon <i>Chidon.</i> Hebrew may be rendered, "prepared;" (Chaldean) as they were almost arrived at the end (Calmet) of the procession. --- <i>His hand,</i> is wanting in Hebrew. (Kennicott) --- <i>Kicked.</i> Protestants, "shook it." (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - "2SA:6:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Rashness.</i> Hebrew <i>shal,</i> means also \"error, ignorance,\" &c. Syriac and Arabic better, \"because he put forth his hand.\" (Kennicott) --- Oza had touched the ark uncovered, (Serarius) shewing too little confidence in God, as if he could not have hindered it from falling; (Rabbins) or perhaps he was the advisor of the ark's being placed upon a cart, instead of the Levites' shoulders. (Tirinus) --- It is not certain that he was a Levite; and the privilege belonged to the sons of Caath, who could claim this honour only after the ark had been folded up with three covers. Moreover, the priests seem to have been always selected to carry the ark, after they came into the promised land, ver. 3., and 1 Kings iv. 4., &c. It is hoped that the fault of Oza would be expiated by his sudden death, (Calmet) as his intention was laudable. (Tirinus) --- But God would teach his ministers with what caution they were to treat sacred things, (Calmet) and how exactly all his injunctions were to be observed. (Haydock)"
      v:010:
        - '2SA:6:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Gethite,</i> a native of Geth-remmon, a Levitical city; (Josue xxi. 24,) or he might have been born at Geth; (Calmet) or his father might have resided there a long time, (Serarius; Tirinus) unless he was there with David. (Salien) --- He was a Levite, 1 Paralipomenon xv. 18., and xvi. 5., and xxvi. 4. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - "2SA:6:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Choirs.</i> Or companies of musicians. (Challoner) --- This sentence is not found in Hebrew nor in St. Jerome's version. (Calmet) --- The Vatican and Alexandrian Septuagint have, \"David brought the ark of the Lord from the house of Obeddara, into the city of David, with joy; (<b>13</b>) and there were seven choirs with him, taking up the ark, and the sacrifice, a calf and lamb; (<b>14</b>) and David played on tuneful organs before the Lord; and David had on a beautiful stole.\" (Haydock)"
      v:013:
        - "2SA:6:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Paces.</i> So altars of turf (Grotius) were erected at this distance from each other, on each side of the road. The pagans have sometimes treated their emperors and deities with the like respect. (Suetonius in Otho and Calig.) --- Paris thus addresses Helena in Ovid's Heroic Epistles.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Ibis Dardanias ingens Regina per urbes,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Teque novam vulgus credet adesse Deam,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Quaque feres gressus, adolebunt cynnama flammæ,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Cœsaque sanguineam victima planget humum.</i>"
      v:014:
        - '2SA:6:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Ephod</i> which ordinarily was the habit of priests. But no law restrained others from using it, (Calmet) particularly on sacred occasions; as we often see laics in a surplice, when they have to sing Church music, &c. (Menochius) --- David had also on a cloak of byssus; (Paralipomenon) and still Michol speaks as if he had been uncovered; because in this solemn ceremony, he was inspired to divest himself of his royal robes, and to act with a degree of enthusiasm; (Haydock) which would not have been otherwise becoming in a king. David is considered by some of the fathers as a figure of the priests of the new law; as he ate the loaves of proposition, was dressed like priests, &c. <i>Sacerdos scitus erat David.</i> (1 Iræn. iv.; St. Ambrose v. in Luc. vi.) (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - "2SA:6:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Leaping.</i> Septuagint, \"beating\" musical instruments....she counted him as nothing, &c. (Haydock) --- She rather partook of her father's disposition and pride. (Menochius)"
      v:018:
        - '2SA:6:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Blessed.</i> Wishing all sorts of happiness. Only priests and kings perform this function publicly, 3 Kings viii. 55. Afterwards David went to his palace, to impart the same blessing to his family, and particularly to the women, who had not been present. This is a vestige of the sacerdotal power, which masters of families formerly enjoyed.'
      v:019:
        - '2SA:6:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Cake,</i> made very thin, with a mixture of oil. --- <i>Beef,</i> sufficient for a meal. --- <i>Oil.</i> This was much esteemed in those days. Many would translate the Hebrew, "a bottle of wine."'
      v:020:
        - "2SA:6:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Fellows.</i> Septuagint, \"dancers.\" Michol exaggerates, as David had been guilty of no indiscretion, ver. 14. (Calmet) --- St. Gregory (Mor. xxvii. 27,) styles her \"insane.\" Yet Abulensis does not sufficiently approve of David's conduct. (Menochius)"
      v:022:
        - '2SA:6:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Eyes.</i> Humility in a king is truly noble. --- <i>Glorious.</i> He accepts the compliment of Michol, though she had spoken ironically. (Haydock)'
      v:023:
        - "2SA:6:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Death.</i> Thus was she punished. The five sons who are attributed to her (chap. xxi. 8.) were only adopted; or perhaps we ought to read Merob, instead of <i>Michol;</i> (Calmet) as the latter had been connected with Phaltiel, and not with Adriel, who was the former's husband. (Haydock)"

      v:017: '2SA:6:17 | 17 | 17 | And they brought the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle, which David had pitched for it: and David offered holocausts, and peace-offerings before the Lord.'

      v:002:
        - '2SA:7:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Nathan.</i> An admirable courtier, (Grotius) and a great saint, Ecclesiasticus xlvii. He was neither too rough, nor too complaisant. --- <i>Cedar.</i> This was the most esteemed species of wood. The palace of the Persian kings, at Ecbatana, was chiefly built of it, and of cypress wood. (Polyb. x.) --- Houses were not there built in such a solid manner, as they are in colder climates. They consisted mostly of wood. --- <i>Skins.</i> The outer veils of the tabernacle were made of skins, as others generally were. (Calmet) --- Hebrew and Chaldean, "of curtains."'
      v:003:
        - '2SA:7:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Thee.</i> David did not, perhaps, consult him as a prophet; and Nathan thought that the proposal was so just, that it might be safely carried into effect. The prophets are not inspired in all their actions. Joseph was of a different opinion from his father, Genesis xlviii. 19. Samuel supposed that Eliab should have been king; (1 Kings xvi. 6,) and Eliseus confesses, that God had concealed from him the affliction of the woman with whom he lodged, 4 Kings iv. 24. (Calmet) --- God afterwards sent the same Nathan to rectify his former decision, that he might not pass sentence, in future, without consulting him. (Menochius)'
      v:007:
        - '2SA:7:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Tribes.</i> 1 Paralipomenon xvii. 6, by the substitution of <i>p</i> for <i>b,</i> reads <i>Shophete,</i> "judges," which seems more natural. Some farther information is there given and we learn that the reason why David was denied the privilege of building a temple, was because he had been so much engaged in war. (Calmet)'

      v:012:
        - "2SA:7:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>I will establish his kingdom.</i> This prophecy partly relates to Solomon; but much more to Christ, who is called the Son of David in Scripture, and the builder of the true temple, which is the Church, his everlasting kingdom, which shall never fail, nor be cast off for any iniquity of her children. (Challoner) --- God passes over all the children whom David had already, 3 Kings ii. 15. The temporal kingdom was enjoyed by David's posterity for a long time, sufficient to verify the expression <i>for ever,</i> as it is often used in Scripture. (Calmet) --- But the spiritual kingdom of the Messias will last till the end of time, and be perfected in eternity. (Haydock) --- In these predictions we must always distinguish the type from the reality. (Calmet)"
      v:014:
        - '2SA:7:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Men,</i> who are not to be entirely destroyed, like the Chanaanites. (Calmet) --- This is not unlike the <i>human temptation</i> of which St. Paul speaks, 1 Corinthians x. 13. See Psalm lxxii. 5., and lxxxviii. 33. (Haydock) --- The <i>rod of men</i> denotes war, and <i>stripes</i> signify those punishments which God inflicts. (St. Jerome, Trad.) --- Some parts of this declaration regard Christ; others Solomon, Hebrews i. 5. (Du Hamel)'

(Menochius) (3 Kings xi. 38.) --- Where is not the house of David? or how is this accomplished, except in the Church? --- <i>Thy face.</i> Septuagint, "before me," which is conformable to Psalm lxxxviii. 38. David saw Solomon on the throne, and beheld the Messias in spirit. (Calmet) --- Souls departed still see what regards them, (Sa) if they be happy. (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - '2SA:7:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Lord.</i> "More in soul, than by this posture of the body, remaining quiet in meditation and prayer." (Cajetan) --- Vatable says only kings were allowed to pray sitting, (Sa; Menochius) and they must be of the house of Juda. (Maimonides) --- They say the priests always stood in the temple. But Josephus mentions seats of lead for them. (Jewish Wars vii. 11.) The Hebrew expression may denote no more, than that David continued for a long time in fervent prayer; Josephus says, prostrate on the ground before the ark. It is not so much the posture of the body as the fervour of the soul, which God regards. See St. Augustine, ad Simp. ii. q. 4.)

People seek for their own and their children's happiness; a favour which thou hast graciously promised unto me. (Calmet) --- Thus immortality, and all happiness, were proposed unto the first man. (Menochius) --- Some use an interrogation; \"Is this the law of Adam?\" (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"manner of man.\" Can this felicity attend a man in his fallen state? Does the greatest friend treat his companion with so much condescension and regard? (Haydock) --- In 1 Paralipomenon xvii. 17, it is thus expressed, <i>and hast made me remarkable above all men, O Lord God.</i> Osiander translates, \"Behold the law of man, of the Lord God.\" I now discern the mysterious union of the godhead with our humanity, in the person of the Son. (Calmet) --- Luther attributes this version, <i>Hæc est ratio hominis, qui Daomius Deus est,</i> to Zisgler; and hence proves the incarnation. Amama and Tarnovius shew the weakness of the proof, though the article of faith be otherwise indubitable.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '2SA:8:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Tribute.</i> Aquila, and probably St. Jerome, translated, "cubit." Others suppose that <i>Amma,</i> or <i>Meteg-ama,</i> is some unknown place, which David wrested from the hands of the Philistines. It is hardly probable that the Israelites would have paid the latter tribute till the 20th year of his reign, (Calmet) or even till the 12th. (Salien) --- He might now force them to pay tribute. (St. Jerome, &c.) (Haydock) --- Perhaps a letter may have been transposed, and instead of Meteg, we should read, "<i>Geth,</i> the mother," or metropolis, and its dependencies; (1 Paralipomenon xviii. 1.) or "he took Metec, (Numbers xxxiii. 28.) and its mother," Geth, which reconciles the two passages. Chaldean, &c., "he deprived them of the advantage of the rivulet." Septuagint, "David took the separated" place, (Serarius) or the city of Geth. (Menochius)'
      v:002:
        - '2SA:8:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Earth,</i> like criminals condemned to die. (Theodoret) --- Some of them he chose to spare, and made tributary, having levelled the strong places with the ground. (Denis the Carthusian) --- Septuagint intimate that half were destroyed. (Calmet) --- But the Hebrew rather implies that the greatest part was saved, "a full cord to save alive;" (Menochius) unless there were three lots, and only one of them, larger indeed than the rest, spared. (Haydock) --- Death, or slavery, were the portion of all who were taken in war. (Grotius, Jur. iii. 4, 20.) --- <i>Lex nulla capto parcit aut pœnam impendit.</i> (Seneca) --- <i>Tribute.</i> Hebrew, "brought gifts," which is a softer term. The Moabites were thus punished for former and, probably, for some recent offences. (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - '2SA:8:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Adarezer.</i> He is styled Adadezer in Hebrew and this seems to have been his true name, though it is written Adarezer in Paralipomenon. Adad, or "the sun," was the chief idol of Syria, and the kings inserted the name with their own; as Benadad did. Josephus produces a fragment from Nicolaus of Damascus, in which he says that "Adad was king of Damascus, and of all Syria, except Phœnicia, and was defeated by David....His successors took his name, as the kings of Egypt did that of Ptolemy; and that the third in descent from this king, made an attack upon Samaria," and upon Achab. (Antiquities vii. 6.) --- <i>Euphrates,</i> which had been promised by God, Genesis xv. 18., and Numbers xxiv. 17. (Calmet) --- Adadezer was probably the aggressor. (Salien) (Menochius)'
      v:004:
        - "2SA:8:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>A thousand.</i> Protestants supply <i>chariots,</i> (Haydock) after the Septuagint and 1 Paralipomenon (xviii. 4.) which have 7000 <i>horsemen.</i> See how we have attempted to reconcile these texts, 1 Kings xiii. 5. Perhaps the numbers were expressed by single letters; and the Hebrew final <i>n,</i> (700) has been mistaken for <i>z,</i> (7000) both here and [in] chap. x. 18. <i>Literis numeralibus non verbis antiquitus numeri concipiebantur.</i> (Scaliger, apud Walton prol.) --- \"Will any other hypothesis so naturally solve this repeated difficulty?\" (Kennicott, Diss. on 1 Chronicles xi. p. 96 and 463.) --- Kimchi thinks that the king's horse-guards are only specified here; and Salien supposes, that those who fought on chariots are also included in Chronicles, as they are often styled horsemen, Isaias xxi. 7, 9. (Menochius) --- <i>Houghed.</i> Aquila, \"destroyed.\" He rendered them unfit for war, as Josue had done, (Josue xi. 6.) supposing that this was the import of the decree, forbidding many horses to be kept, Deuteronomy xvii. 16. --- <i>Horses</i> is not expressed in Hebrew, though the Protestants supply the word; as also, <i>for.</i> We should translate literally, \"He left out of them 100 chariots;\" (Haydock) as we read elsewhere, that Adarezer had 1000. (Menochius) --- But this expression being unintelligible, no less than, \"he houghed all the chariots,\" as the text stands at present in the original, may lead us to suspect that this verse has been inaccurately printed. Septuagint, \"David paralyzed, (or rendered useless) all the chariots; and 100 chariots were reserved for himself out of them.\" Josephus says the rest of the 1000 chariots were burnt, 5000 horse slain, and 20,000 foot. (Haydock)"
      v:005:
        - '2SA:8:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Men.</i> As Adarezer had brought upon himself the arms of David, perhaps by attempting to succour the Moabites, as he afterwards did the children of Ammon; (chap. x.) so the king of Damascus was ruined by coming too late to his assistance. This king may be the Adad mentioned by Nicolaus. (B. 4.) (Salien, the year of the world 2993, the 14th year of David.) See ver. 1 and 3.'
      v:007:

(Calmet) --- These bucklers might be for ornament, like those of Solomon, 3 Kings x. 16. (Salien) --- They were taken afterwards by Sesac, king of Egypt. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] vii. 6.) (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - '2SA:8:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Beroth,</i> or Boroe. (Calmet) --- <i>Brass.</i> All for the use of the temple, 1 Paralipomenon xviii. 8. The battle seems to have been fought near Beroth. (Salien)'

        - '2SA:8:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Emath,</i> or Emesa. Its king, Thou, being alarmed at the ambition of his neighbour Adarezer, (Calmet) was pleased with the victories of a prince from whom he thought he had less to fear, as he lived at a greater distance. (Haydock)'

      v:011:
        - '2SA:8:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Subdued.</i> This was the custom of most conquerors. But no prince was ever more religious in this respect than David. He had an officer appointed over the sacred treasure, which contained the presents of Samuel, Saul, &c., 1 Paralipomenon xxvi. 26, 28.'
      v:013:
        - '2SA:8:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Name,</i> or triumphal arch. (Rabbins) --- He acquired great fame, chap. vii. 9., and Machabees v. 57. (Menochius) --- <i>Syria,</i> which is styled <i>Aram</i> in Hebrew. The Septuagint have read <i>Edom,</i> or Idumea, as the two names have often been confounded, on account of the similarity of the letters. The following verse seems favourable to this reading, as well as the title of the Psalm lix; and 1 Paralipomenon xviii. 12, says, <i>Abisai....slew of the Edomites, in the valley of the salt-pits,</i> 18,000. It is probable that David was present. This Idumea was on the east of the Dead Sea, and had Bosra for its capital. The salt-pits might be a great plain, about three miles south of Palmyra or Thadmor, which supplies almost all Syria with salt. (Brun.) (Calmet) --- Othes think that the borders of the most salt lake of Sodom are denoted. (Menochius) See Genesis xiv. 10.'
      v:014:
        - '2SA:8:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Guards,</i> or officers to administer justice in his name, after Joab had killed all the males, during six months, 3 Kings xi. 15. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - '2SA:8:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>All Israel,</i> not only over Juda. (Menochius) --- All the people who dwelt within the promised land, as far as the Euphrates, were forced to acknowledge his dominion. (Haydock) --- <i>People,</i> settling their differences, &c. Kings formerly performed in person, the most important office of rendering justice; whence three kings of Crete are mentioned as judges in the realms below. (Calmet) --- David acted with wisdom and justice. (Menochius)'
      v:016:
        - '2SA:8:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Sarvia,</i> sister of David, 1 Paralipomenon ii. 16. --- <i>Army.</i> Joab had acquired such influence over it, that his power was formidable even to David. He was a great warrior, and had contributed more than any other person to establish the throne of his uncle; but he was devoid of justice, and not much unlike Achilles.{JOIN}{BQ:2}Jura negat sibi nata, nihil non arrogat armis. (Horace){JOIN}(Grotius) --- <i>Recorder,</i> or chancellor. (Challoner) --- <i>A commentariis.</i> (Aquila) --- "Remembrancer," (Haydock) or the person who kept a journal of all memorable transactions. The kings of Persia employed people to keep such journals, 1 Esdras iv. 15., and Esther vi. 1. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xi. 2.) --- The power of these writers was very great, Judges v. 14., and 4 Kings xviii. 18. (Calmet) --- Reference is often made to their "words of days." They had also to present petitions and memorials from the people. (Menochius)'
      v:017:
        - '2SA:8:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Achimelech</i> is also called the father of <i>Abiathar,</i> as these two had both names indiscriminately, 1 Kings xxi. 2. During the contest between the families of Saul and of David, two high priests were acknowledged, in their respective dominions. Sadoc was also permitted to officiate at Gabaon, during the reign of David; and, as Abiathar took part against Solomon, he was invested with the whole authority, and thus were accomplished the predictions made to Phinees and to Heli, Numbers xxv. 12., and 1 Kings ii. 35. (Calmet) --- Yet Salien considers Abiathar as the sole pontiff, from the time that his father was murdered by Saul. Sadoc, in the mean while, was his arch-priest or delegate, at Gabaon; (Haydock) though Abulensis and Josephus acknowledge both as high priests, (1 Paralipomenon xxiv. 3,) officiating by turns. (Menochius) --- <i>Scribe,</i> or secretary. (Challoner) See Judges v. 14. --- Septuagint, "counsellor." He is called Susa, in Chronicles. (Haydock)'
      v:018:

(Challoner) --- They were Philistines, and had attached themselves to David while he was at Geth, continuing always faithful to him. We read of them in the Vulgate, under the reign of Joas, 4 Kings xi. 19. David selected some out of all Israel, towards the end of his reign, 1 Paralipomenon xxvii. --- <i>Princes:</i> literally, <i>priests;</i> (Cohen) so called, by a title of honour, and not for exercising the priestly functions. (Challoner) --- Sanctius translates, they \"were like priests.\" The book of 1 Paralipomenon (xviii. 17,) explains, <i>were chief about the king.</i> Septuagint, \"masters of the palace.\" David kept them near his person, and employed them as he thought proper: Bertram thinks, in embassies, till after the revolt of Absalom, when Ira took their place, chap. xx. 26.

These nations adopted the same customs as the Hebrews: they cut their hair, and rent their garments, to express their deep affliction, Isaias xv. 2. The Arabs would deem it a great insult, and a piece of irreligion, to shave their beard. (Darvieux vii. p. 175.) Plutarch (Agesil) observes, that the Lacedemonians obliged those who acted in a cowardly manner in war, to wear only one whisker: and Herodotus (ii. 121,) takes notice of a person who, in contempt, cut off the beard on the right cheeks of some soldiers, who were placed to guard the body of his brother, who had been gibbeted, having first made them drunk, that he might take away the body. The <i>garments</i> (Aquila says, "the tunic," Septuagint, "the cloak, <i>or</i> mandua," which is a military garment used in Persia) were cut (Calmet) for the same purpose, like our spencers, (Haydock) that the ambassadors might be exposed to derision, as breeches were not usually worn, (Calmet) except by priests officiating. (Du Hamel) --- This was in contempt of circumcision. (Menochius) --- Yet we cannot suppose, but that the ambassadors would procure something to cover themselves before they arrived at Jericho, where they remained till their beard and the hair of their head (1 Paralipomenon xix.) were grown.

(Calmet) See Judges, ix. 57. --- Joab supposed that David might probably adduce this instance, to shew the danger of approaching too near the wall, as it had proved destructive to part of his army, and had been fatal to Abimelech. But it seems the messenger did not allow him time to express any resentment, before he told him the agreeable news, which he desired so much to hear [in] ver. 24. (Haydock)'

        - "2SA:11:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Lord;</i> not that David had married the woman, but on account of his former conduct towards her and her husband. (Menochius) --- The canon law forbids the marriages of those who have been accomplices in the death of their former partner; and some have thought that this marriage of David was null. But this is inaccurate; and the fruits of it were (Calmet) all deeded legitimate. See 1 Paralipomenon iii. 5. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins even pretend that David was guilty of no sin in marrying Bethsabee during the life-time of Urias; as the latter, they say, must have given her a bill of divorce when he went to war. (Grotius) --- But why should we excuse an action which was so severely condemned and punished by God? (Chap. xii. 1., &c., and Psalm l.) (Calmet) --- In David's conduct, we here behold a complication of the basest passions of lust and cruelty; which make David neglect the sanctity of an oath, (ver. 11) and attempt to ruin, by drunkenness, the soul of one to whom he was much indebted; and, afterwards, to expose him to an untimely death, perhaps without repentance; if indeed Urias exceeded the bounds of moderation. This however is not certain; as the word <i>drunk</i> is often used to denote a degree of blameless conviviality, Genesis xliii. 34. Yet the design of David was equally criminal. How soon may the man <i>according to God's own heart,</i> fall from his elevated station into the depth of the abyss! <i>Wherefore let him that thinketh himself to stand, take heed lest he fall,</i> 1 Corinthians x. 12. (Haydock)"

      v:002: "2SA:11:2 | 2 | 2 | In the mean time it happened that David arose from his bed after noon, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and he saw from the roof of his house, a woman washing herself, over-against him: and the woman was very beautiful."

      v:012: '2SA:11:12 | 12 | 12 | Then David said to Urias: Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will send thee away. Urias tarried in Jerusalem that day and the next.'

        - "2SA:12:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Unto him,</i> after the birth of the child. A whole year had nearly elapsed, and David continued blind and impenitent. The spirit of prophecy had left him; and, though he was clear-sighted, and equitable enough to punish the faults of others, he could not discern his own picture, till Nathan had removed the veil. The prophet acted with the utmost prudence, and did not condemn the king till he had pronounced sentence on himself. It is commonly supposed that the interview was private. St. Chrysostom believes that the chief lords of the court were present; which would enhance the discretion of Nathan, as well as David's humility. (Calmet)"

      v:004:
        - '2SA:12:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>To him.</i> This wanton cruelty caused David to pronounce him deserving of death; as simple theft was punished with only a four-fold restitution, Exodus xxii. 1. Judges sometimes diminish, and at other times increase, the severity of the law, according to the dispositions of the offenders, which lawgivers could not exactly foresee. (Calmet)'

      v:010:
        - "2SA:12:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>House.</i> What a dismal scene opens itself to our view during the remaining part of David's reign! (Haydock) --- Scarcely one of his successors was free from war; even Solomon was disturbed by the rebellion of Jeroboam, &c., and many of David's family and descendants came to an untimely end, ver. 6. (Calmet) --- Six sons of Josaphat, all Joram's, except one, Josias, the children of Sedecias, &c., 4 Kings xxv., &c. (Worthington)"

        - '2SA:12:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>I will raise,</i> &c. All these evils, inasmuch as they were <i>punishments,</i> came upon Daivd by a just judgment of God, for his sin; and therefore God says, <i>I will raise,</i> &c. But inasmuch as they were <i>sins,</i> on the part of Absalom and his associates, God was not the author of them, but only permitted them. (Challoner) --- God permitted the wicked prince to succeed for some time, that he might punish David. (Calmet) --- <i>Neighbour,</i> most dearly beloved. To be treated ill by such a one, is doubly severe, Psalm liv. 15. (Menochius)'
      v:012:
        - '2SA:12:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Sun,</i> publicly, chap. xvi. 22. How abominable soever this conduct of an unnatural son must have been to God, he says, <i>I will do this;</i> because, when he might have prevented it by a more powerful grace, or by the death of the delinquent, he suffered him to carry his infernal project into execution. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - "2SA:12:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Sinned.</i> His confession was sincere, and very different from that of Saul, 1 Kings xv. 24. \"The expression was the same; but God saw the difference of the heart.\" (St. Augustine, contra Faust. xxii. 27.) --- <i>Sin.</i> He has remitted the fault and the eternal punishment, and he has greatly diminished the temporal chastisement, and will not inflict instant death, as he seemed to have threatened, ver. 10. (Calmet) --- \"The speedy remission shewed the greatness of the king's repentance.\" (St. Ambrose, Apol. 2.)"
      v:014:
        - '2SA:12:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Occasion.</i> Literally, "made" almost, in the same sense, as God threatened to do, what was effected by Absalom, ver. 12. David did not co-operate with the malice of infidels; but he was responsible for it: in as much as he had committed an unlawful action, which gave them occasion to blaspheme God, as if he had not been able to foresee this scandalous transaction. Thus God and religion are often vilified, on account of the misconduct of those who have the happiness to be well informed, but do not live up to their profession: but this mode of argumentation is very fallacious and uncandid. It ought, however, to be a caution to the servants of the true God, never to do any thing which may have such fatal consequences; and alienate the minds of weak men from the truth. --- <i>Die.</i> Thus infidels would see, that God did not suffer David to pass quite unpunished.

        - "2SA:12:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Wife.</i> She had partaken in his affliction and repentance. The Jews say that David told her the divine oracle, which is mentioned [in] 3 Kings i. 13, 17., that her next son should succeed to the throne. Salien (the year of the world 3000) supposes that he was conceived in May, two months after the death of Bethsabee's first-born, and came into the world about the time of the Passover. --- <i>Solomon,</i> \"the pacific.\" See 1 Paralipomenon xxii. 9. (Menochius)"
      v:025:
        - '2SA:12:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Amiable to the Lord.</i> Or beloved of the Lord. In Hebrew, <i>Yedideya.</i> (Challoner) --- <i>Loved him,</i> is not expressed in Hebrew, "because of the Lord." (Haydock) --- Theodotion, "in the word, or agreeably to, the order of the Lord." Solomon never went by the name which God here gives him, (Calmet) except in this place. (Menochius) --- It shews the gratuitous predilection which God had for him; but affords no proof of his predestination to glory, of which there is too much reason to doubt. (Calmet)'
      v:027:
        - '2SA:12:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>The city of waters.</i> Rabbath, the royal city of the Ammonites, was called <i>the city of waters,</i> from being encompassed with waters. (Challoner) See chap. v. 8. --- The Hebrew in the preceding verse seems to insinuate, (Haydock) that "he had taken the royal city." But he was only on the point of doing it, or had, perhaps, made himself master of some part of it. Here the Hebrew, "I have taken," may be explained in the same sense, unless <i>the city of waters</i> were the lower part of Rabbath, lying on the Jaboc. Junius translates, "He cut off the waters, which entered the city;" and Josephus favours this explanation. It seems the siege lasted about two years. (Calmet) --- Antiochus took this city, by depriving the inhabitants of water. (Polybius v.)'
      v:028:
        - '2SA:12:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Take it.</i> The higher, and more impregnable part; which honour Joab reserved for David.'
      v:030:
        - '2SA:12:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>King.</i> Hebrew, <i>Malcam,</i> "their king." Moloc, "king," or the chief idol of the Ammonites. It was forbidden to use the ornaments of the idols on Chanaan, but not of other nations. This crown might be worth a talent, on account of the gold and precious stones; (1 Paralipomenon xx. 2.; Sanchez; Bochart,) or it might weigh so much as almost 87 pounds, (Calmet) or above 113 pounds English. (Haydock) --- Such immence crowns were sometimes suspended for ornament, over the throne; as Benjamin of Tudela says was done by the emperor Commenes. Pliny describes one of nine pounds; and Athenæus (v. 8,) another of 80 cubits, or 40 yards (Haydock) in circumference. (Calmet) --- The idol, or the king of Ammon, (Menochius) might have one of the like nature, suspended. The Rabbins say David caused it to hand in the air by means of a load-stone; as if it would attract gold! (Calmet)'
      v:031:
        - '2SA:12:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Sawed.</i> Hebrew, "he put <i>them</i> under saws, and under rollers of iron, and under knives," &c. (Haydock) --- The Jews say that Isaias was killed by being sawed asunder; to which punishment St. Paul alludes, Hebrews xi. 37. (Menochius) --- <i>Brick-kilns,</i> or furnaces, Psalm xx. 10. (Muis) --- Daniel and his companions were thrown into the fiery furnace, Daniel iii. 6, 11., and Esther xiii. 7. (Calmet) --- Some condemn David of excessive cruelty on this occasion. (Tirinus; Sanctius) --- But the Scripture represents his conduct as irreproachable, except in the affair of Urias; (3 Kings xv. 5,) and at this distance of time, we know not the motives which might have actuated him to treat his enemy with such severity. The Ammonites had probably exercised similar cruelties on his subjects. See 1 Kings xi. 2., and Amos i. 13. (Calmet) --- They had shamefully violated the law of nations, and had stirred up various kings against David. (Menochius) --- Salien blames Joab for what may seem too cruel. But, though he was barbarous and vindictive, we need not condemn him on this occasion, no more than his master; as we are not to judge of former times by our own manners. (Haydock) --- War was then carried on with great cruelty. (Calmet)'

      v:018: '2SA:12:18 | 18 | 18 | And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died: and the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead. For they said: Behold, when the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how much more will he afflict himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?'
      v:019: '2SA:12:19 | 19 | 19 | But when David saw his servants whispering, he understood that the child was dead: and he said to his servants: Is the child dead? They answered him: He is dead.'

      v:022: '2SA:12:22 | 22 | 22 | And he said: While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept for him: for I said: Who knoweth whether the Lord may not give him to me, and the child may live?'
      v:023: '2SA:12:23 | 23 | 23 | But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Shall I be able to bring him back any more? I shall go to him rather: but he shall not return to me.'

      v:030: "2SA:12:30 | 30 | 30 | And he took the crown of their king from his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold, set with most precious stones; and it was put upon David's head, and the spoils of the city, which were very great, he carried away."
      v:031: '2SA:12:31 | 31 | 31 | And bringing forth the people thereof, he sawed them, and drove over them chariots armed with iron: and divided them with knives, and made them pass through brick-kilns: so did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon.

The Rabbins pretend that she was conceived before David married her mother, and that the latter was a pagan; so that they suppose there was no relationship between Thamar and Amnon.

      v:002: '2SA:13:2 | 2 | 2 | And he was exceedingly fond of her, so that he fell sick for the love of her: for as she was a virgin, he thought it hard to do any thing dishonestly with her.'
      v:003: '2SA:13:3 | 3 | 3 | Now Amnon had a friend, named Jonadab, the son of Semmaa, the brother of David, a very wise man:'
      v:004: '2SA:13:4 | 4 | 4 | And he said to him: Why dost thou grow so lean from day to day, O son of the king? why dost thou not tell me the reason of it? And Amnon said to him: I am in love with Thamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.'
      v:005: '2SA:13:5 | 5 | 5 | And Jonadab said to him: Lie down upon thy bed, and feign thyself sick: and when thy father shall come to visit thee, say to him: Let my sister Thamar, I pray thee, come to me, to give me to eat, and to make me a mess, that I may eat it at her hand.'
      v:006: '2SA:13:6 | 6 | 6 | So Amnon lay down, and made as if he were sick: and when the king came to visit him, Amnon said to the king: I pray thee, let my sister Thamar come, and make in my sight two little messes, that I may eat at her hand.'
      v:007: '2SA:13:7 | 7 | 7 | Then David sent home to Thamar, saying: Come to the house of thy brother Amnon, and make him a mess.'
      v:008: '2SA:13:8 | 8 | 8 | And Thamar came to the house of Amnon, her brother: but he was laid down: and she took meal and tempered it: and dissolving it in his sight, she made little messes.'
      v:009: '2SA:13:9 | 9 | 9 | And taking what she had boiled, she poured it out, and set it before him, but he would not eat: and Amnon said: Put out all persons from me. And when they had put all persons out,'

      v:016: '2SA:13:16 | 16 | 16 | She answered him: This evil, which now thou dost against me, in driving me away, is greater than that which thou didst before. And he would not hearken to her.'

      v:021: '2SA:13:21 | 21 | 21 | And when king David heard of these things he was exceedingly grieved: and he would not afflict the spirit of his son Amnon, for he loved him, because he was his first-born.'
      v:022: '2SA:13:22 | 22 | 22 | But Absalom spoke not to Amnon, neither good nor evil: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had ravished his sister Thamar.'

      v:026: '2SA:13:26 | 26 | 26 | And Absalom said: If thou wilt not come, at least let my brother, Amnon, I beseech thee, come with us. And the king said to him: It is not necessary that he should go with thee.'
      v:027: "2SA:13:27 | 27 | 27 | But Absalom pressed him, so that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. And Absalom made a feast, as it were the feast of a king."

      v:029: "2SA:13:29 | 29 | 29 | And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon, as Absalom had commanded them. And all the king's sons arose, and got up every man upon his mule, and fled."
      v:030: "2SA:13:30 | 30 | 30 | And while they were yet in the way, a rumour came to David, saying: Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left."
      v:031: '2SA:13:31 | 31 | 31 | Then the king rose up, and rent his garments, and fell upon the ground: and all his servants, that stood about him, rent their garments.'
      v:032: "2SA:13:32 | 32 | 32 | But Jonadab, the son of Semmaa, David's brother, answering, said: Let not my lord the king think, that all the king's sons are slain: Amnon only is dead, for he was appointed by the mouth of Absalom from the day that he ravished his sister, Thamar."
      v:033: "2SA:13:33 | 33 | 33 | Now, therefore, let not my lord the king take this thing into his heart, saying: All the king's sons are slain: for Amnon only is dead."
      v:034: '2SA:13:34 | 34 | 34 | But Absalom fled away: and the young man that kept the watch, lifted up his eyes and looked: and behold there came much people by a bye-way on the side of the mountain.'
      v:035: "2SA:13:35 | 35 | 35 | And Jonadab said to the king: Behold the king's sons are come: as thy servant said, so it is."
      v:036: "2SA:13:36 | 36 | 36 | And when he made an end of speaking, the king's sons also appeared: and, coming in, they lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also, and all his servants, wept very much."
      v:037: '2SA:13:37 | 37 | 37 | But Absalom fled, and went to Tholomai, the son of Ammiud, the king of Gessur. And David mourned for his son every day.'
      v:038: '2SA:13:38 | 38 | 38 | And Absalom, after he was fled, and come into Gessur, was there three years. And king David ceased to pursue after Absalom, because he was comforted concerning the death of Amnon.'

Le Clerc, "And cannot the prince (or judge) pardon a man, and devise means to leave his son no longer in exile?"

      v:026:
        - "2SA:14:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>A year.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, \"from the end of the days to days.\" --- Chaldean, \"as it was convenient.\" But the Vulgate seems the best, (Calmet) and is followed by the Protestant version. (Haydock) --- <i>Sicles,</i> including all his hair. The Hebrews wore their hair very long. It does not commonly grow above four inches in a year; so that the hair which was cut off could not weigh 200 sicles. (Calmet) --- <i>Weight.</i> Hebrew, \"after the king's stone,\" <i>Beeben;</i> but one manuscript has <i>Boshkol,</i> with the Septuagint, \"after the king's sicle (Kennicott) weight,\" at Babylon, as Pelletier supposes that this work was written towards the end of the captivity. He allows that Absalom's hair might weigh almost 31 ounces. Some women wear above 32 ounces, if we may believe the hair-dressers. Some suppose that <i>r</i> (200) has been substituted instead of <i>d</i> (4) or <i>c,</i> (20) &c. But all are not convinced that the Hebrews formerly marked the numbers by letters. Septuagint have, \"100 sicles,\" (Calmet) which some attempt to reconcile with the common reading, by saying, that they speak of the sicles of the sanctuary, which were double the weight of the king's sicle. Yet the Alexandrian and Vatican copies agree with the Vulgate: (Haydock) and of this distinction of weights there is no proof. The Rabbins assert that the value, and not the weight, of Absalom's hair is given; (Calmet) and that he made a present of his hair to some of his friends, who sold it to the ladies of Jerusalem, to adorn their heads. (Sanctius) --- Tirinus adopts this sentiment, and ridicules those who say that the weight is meant; as he says, 200 sicles would be equivalent to 8¾ Roman pounds, which comes near to Arbuthnot's calculation in English. (Haydock) --- Bochart reduces the weight to four such pounds, each consisting of twelve ounces; and he supposes that the hair was so heavy, on account of the gold dust with which it was covered, according to the fashion of those times. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] viii. 1.) --- But this weight would be only accidental. (Calmet) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] vii. 8.) intimates, that Absalom's hair was \"cut every eight days,\" or \"for the space of eight days.\" It is quite incredible that it should weigh 200 sicles, or five minæ of Alexandria, each consisting of twelve ounces. The Latin interpreter reads, \"every eight months.\" (Calmet) --- St. Epiphanius and Hero have 125 sicles, or about 31 ounces. (Haydock) --- The Babylonian sicle, here mentioned, was only the third part of that used by the Hebrews. (Du Hamel)"

(Menochius) --- Some Greek and Latin copies add, that she was married to Roboam, the son of Solomon, by whom he had Abias. But this addition is of no authority, and can hardly be reconciled with chronology. We read that Roboam espoused Maaca, the daughter of Absalom; (2 Paralipomenon xi. 20.) but she might be only his grand-daughter, by Thamar. (Calmet) --- Josephus had adopted this addition. (Haydock)'

      v:006: '2SA:14:6 | 6 | 6 | And thy handmaid had two sons: and they quarrelled with each other in the field, and there was none to part them: and the one struck the other, and slew him.'

      v:012: '2SA:14:12 | 12 | 12 | Then the woman said: Let thy handmaid speak one word to my lord the king. And he said: Speak.'
      v:013: '2SA:14:13 | 13 | 13 | And the woman said: Why hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? and why hath the king spoken this word, to sin, and not bring home again his own exile?'

      v:020: '2SA:14:20 | 20 | 20 | That I should come about with this form of speech, thy servant Joab commanded this: but thou, my lord the king, art wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to understand all things upon earth.'

      v:022: '2SA:14:22 | 22 | 22 | And Joab falling down to the ground upon his face, adored, and blessed the king: and Joab said: This day thy servant hath understood, that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord the king: for thou hast fulfilled the request of thy servant.'

      v:025: '2SA:14:25 | 25 | 25 | But in all Israel there was not a man so comely, and so exceedingly beautiful, as Absalom: from the sole of the foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.'

      v:028: "2SA:14:28 | 28 | 28 | And Absalom dwelt two years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face."

So the servants of Absalom set the corn on fire. And Joab's servants coming, with their garments rent, said: The servants of Absalom have set part of the field on fire."
      v:031: '2SA:14:31 | 31 | 31 | Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said: Why have thy servants set my corn on fire?'
      v:032: '2SA:14:32 | 32 | 32 | And Absalom answered Joab: I sent to thee, beseeching thee to come to me, that I might send thee to the king, to say to him: Wherefore am I come from Gessur? It had been better for me to be there. I beseech thee, therefore, that I may see the face of the king: and if he be mindful of my iniquity, let him kill me.'
      v:033: '2SA:14:33 | 33 | 33 | So Joab going in to the king, told him all: and Absalom was called for, and he went in to the king: and prostrated himself on the ground before him: and the king kissed Absalom.'

        - "2SA:15:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Before him.</i> Romulus instituted the 300 guards, whom he called <i>Celeres,</i> for the like purpose. (Calmet) --- Absalom's ambition could not wait patiently for the death of his father, who was not yet sixty years old, and had been first anointed forty years before, ver. 7. He looked upon himself as the heir apparent, Amnon being now slain, and Cheliab (or Daniel) either dead, as it is thought, or unfit for government, while Solomon was only eight years old. (Salien) --- The quality of his mother, and his own personal qualifications, made him despise his brethren, and he began to assume the equipage of a king. (Calmet) --- David considered this as only the effect of juvenile vanity, and he had not a mind to irritate him, without the utmost necessity. (Salien) --- Hebrew, \"Absalom prepared for himself a chariot, (Protestants, chariots) and horses,\" &c. (Haydock) --- It is not certain whether he had any other horsemen but those who mounted the chariots. Horses were then very scarce in Israel. (Calmet) --- Adonias afterwards imitated his brother's ambition, during his father's life; (3 Kings i. 5.) so that <i>evil</i> was continually raised up against David, out of his <i>own house,</i> chap. xii. 11."
      v:002:
        - '2SA:15:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Israel.</i> Absalom rises early for wickedness. He assumes the character of a most zealous and disinterested judge, as if to contrast his conduct with the remissness of some appointed by the king; though the Holy Ghost bears witness to the integrity of David, chap. viii. 15. Who would not be deceived by such appearances, if the arts of hypocrites had not taught us to examine things to the bottom, and to be upon our guard? <i>If thy eye be evil, thy whole body will be darksome.</i> [Matthew vi. 23.] The intention decides all. (Haydock)'

(Haydock) --- Thus acted Otho. <i>Protendens manum, adorare vulgus, jacere oscula et omnia serviliter pro dominatione.</i> (Tacitus, Hist. i.) --- "Stretching out his hand, he bowed to the common people, dispensed his kisses at random, and performed all the acts of servility to obtain the throne." (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - '2SA:15:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Enticed.</i> Hebrew, "stole." The people were not aware of his designs. (Calmet) --- Absalom rendered them dissatisfied with the present government, and led them to expect better days, under his administration. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - "2SA:15:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Forty,</i> which Vatable dates from the time when the people petitioned for a king; Salien, from the first anointing of David. (Menochius) --- It is probable enough that this number has been substituted instead of <i>four,</i> which Josephus, Theodoret, Syriac, Arabic, and many Latin manuscripts read; and Absalom would employ this term in securing the interest of Israel, before he declared himself openly their king. (Calmet) --- He had been so long at Jerusalem, since his return. (Salien) --- The canon of Hebrew verity, supposed to be made about the ninth century, is said (by Martinnay; Haydock) to be altered by some correcting hand, from four to forty. (Kennicott) --- This is the famous Memmian canon, which Theodulph, bishop of Orleans, is believed to have ordered, as the standard of truth, according to the Hebrew copies of that day: (Haydock) and this seems to have guided the Ben. editor of St. Jerome's works, and of his translation; so that it is no wonder if \"the printed copies agree in so many places with the corrupted Hebrew.\" <i>Canon Memmianus purèleget juxta Hebræum, quod nos edidimus.</i> (Note on 2 Paralipomenon xiii. 3, 17.) The Vulgate of Sixtus V, in that passage, as well as in the present, reads the smaller numbers, as he was guided by the best <i>Latin</i> copies, whereas Clement VIII has also consulted \"the Hebrew fountains.\" The former, says Kennicott, (Diss. ii. p. 205) \"seems to have been printed on a juster plan....and the old Latin version is likely to be found more pure in the edition of Sixtus than in that of Clement, since the latter seems to have corrected his Latin by the modern (i.e., the corrupted) Hebrew copies.\" Dr. James observes, that \"almost all the Latin editions received in the Church, for many years, (preceding 1590) agree with Sixtus,\" who here reads <i>quatuor,</i> with many others; so that Grotius is well supported in having pronounced so decisively, \"without doubt there is a mistake, two letters having been added at the end of <i>arbá.</i> The thing itself declares that <i>four</i> years had elapsed.\" (Kennicott) --- It appears to be indubitable, that some mistakes have taken place with regard to numbers. But that this place is incorrect may not be so certain, as the chronology of Salien, Usher, &c., explains it well enough. The Hebrew text was esteemed more correct when the last editions of St. Jerome, and of the Vulgate, were given, than it is at present. (Haydock)"
      v:008:

        - '2SA:15:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Absalom.</i> How came they to abandon a king, appointed by heaven, and adorned with so many virtues? God was resolved to punish him. Many are always desirous of novelty. David had lately been guilty of two scandalous crimes. Joab remained unpunished, and arrogant; the judges neglected their duty, &c., ver. 3.

He departs on foot, like a penitent, acknowledging the justice of God. Fear does not prompt him to leave Jerusalem, which was a place of such strength, (chap. v. 6.) nor are his attendants abandoned on a sudden by that courage, which made some of them a match for a whole army. David disposes of all things with great coolness and prudence. (Calmet) --- He wishes to appease God. (Menochius)'

        - '2SA:16:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Siba</i> was a mean character, but of sufficient discernment to judge that David would gain the day. He came to calumniate his master; and David paid too much attention to him, though his testimony would not have been received in a court of judicature. (Calmet) --- We must reflect that the mind of David was full of trouble, and devoid of suspicion. (Haydock) --- But he did wrong (Worthington) in condemning Miphiboseth unheard. --- <i>Raisins.</i> See 1 Kings xxv. 18. (Calmet) --- <i>Figs;</i> (<i>palatharum</i>) which are often called <i>caricarum.</i> (Menochius) --- Hebrew <i>mea kayits,</i> "a hundred of summer" fruits, like fresh grapes, (Numbers xiii. 21.) and other fruits, gathered after harvest time, Micheas vii. 1.'

      v:010:
        - "2SA:16:10 | 10 | 10-11 | <i>Hath bid him curse.</i> Not that the Lord was the author of Semei's sin, which proceeded purely from his own malice, and the abuse of his free-will; but that knowing and suffering his malicious disposition to break out on this occasion, he made use of him as his instrument to punish David for his sins. (Challoner) --- He adored the justice of God; who is often said to do what he does not hinder, or what he only permits. (Estius) --- David is here a noble figure of Jesus Christ, excusing his executioners, (Haydock) and receiving the insults of the Jews, without complaining. (Calmet) --- If Semei had not been guilty of sin, but acted according to God's will, he could not have been justly punished, 3 Kings ii. (Worthington)"

        - '2SA:16:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Chosen.</i> (<i>Vox populi, vox Dei</i>) Private people are not commonly able, or allowed, to judge of the right, which the prince has to the throne. But here Absalom was manifestly an usurper; and many still adhered to David.

      v:021:
        - '2SA:16:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Their hands may be strengthened,</i> &c. The people might apprehend lest Absalom should be reconciled to his father; and therefore they followed him with some fear of being left in the lurch, till they saw such a crime committed, as seemed to make a reconciliation impossible. (Challoner) --- This was the most heinous outrage that a son could offer to his father. Jacob resented it to the last, Genesis xlix. 4. Amyntor devoted his son Phœnix to all the furies, for a similar offence. (Homer, Iliad ix.) Armais treated the wives of his brother Sesostris in this manner, when he had resolved to rebel.

        - '2SA:16:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Absalom.</i> It tended to promote the end which was desired, (Haydock) whether good or bad. His prudence is hyperbolically compared with the divine oracles; (Menochius) and his authority must have had great weight, since David began to take precautions, only after he had heard that Achitophel had joined the rebels; and Absalom was persuaded (Calmet) to perpetrate so foul and unnatural a crime publicly, no one daring to make any opposition. Chusai was silent; as he was aware that, if he began to contradict this counsellor at first, he would only incur suspicion. (Haydock) --- The unjust commonly endeavour by all means to attach people to themselves: but God, in the end, turns their counsels against themselves. (Worthington)'

But it is almost universally believed that he set a pattern to Judas, the traitor, in this mode of dying, as well as in perfidy. He was aware that Absalom was undone, and vexed that his counsel had been disregarded. The most prudent of this world are often blind to their own welfare. The Jews had not yet begun to refuse the rites of sepulture to suicides. (Calmet)'

        - '2SA:17:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>To the camp.</i> The city of Mahanaim, the name of which in Hebrew, signifies <i>The Camp.</i> It was a city of note at that time; as appears from its having been chosen by Isboseth for the place of his residence.

(Menochius) --- <i>Naas</i> is either the name of Isai's wife, or rather the latter had both names, 1 Paralipomenon ii. 13, 16. Septuagint read Jesse, in the edition of Complut.; in others, Naas. (Calmet) --- Joab; so that these two were own cousins, and both nephews of David."

Precious metals were then rarely used in the kitchen. --- <i>Pulse,</i> (<i>cicer</i>) or "parched peas." Hebrew <i>kali,</i> is thus twice translated, as it had been rendered <i>parched corn.</i> It signifies any thing "parched."

      v:009: '2SA:17:9 | 9 | 9 | Perhaps he now lieth hid in pits, or in some other place where he list: and when any one shall fall at the first, every one that heareth it, shall say: There is a slaughter among the people that followed Absalom.'

But they that sought them, when they found them not, returned into Jerusalem."
      v:021: '2SA:17:21 | 21 | 21 | And when they were gone, they came up out of the well, and going on, told king David, and said: Arise, and pass quickly over the river: for this manner of counsel has Achitophel given against you.'

(Haydock) --- <i>Consumed,</i> viz., by pits and precipices: (Challoner) "wild beasts." (Syriac, &c.) Many also died of their wounds, and were slain in the wood; (Calmet) so that not less, probably, than 50,000 perished on this fatal day. (Haydock)'

(Calmet) --- <i>Slew him,</i> inflicting many wounds on him; though Joab had already done sufficient. (Haydock) --- These men abused his corpse, as if to revenge the insult offered to David's ten wives. (Salien) --- It is asked whether Joab did wrong? He consulted the public welfare, rather than the parental affection of the king for a son, whom the law condemned to die for rebellion, incest, and murder, Leviticus xviii. 29., and chap. xiii. 28. But still he was not a proper judge to inflict this death in cold blood; and thus to render the salvation of Absalom's soul more desperate. David would, however, have done well to have punished this son, as incorrigible and dangerous to the state. (Haydock)"

        - '2SA:18:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Him.</i> Thus was the law executed upon Absalom, Deuteronomy xxi. 18. (St. Jerome) (Menochius) -- History scarcely affords a more detestable character; and his punishment was no less terrible than instructive. He was a figure of the Jews persecuting Jesus Christ, while he gave his blood for the redemption of these his enemies, and prayed for them. As they continued obdurate, they were held up as objects of horror both to heaven and to all nations, like Absalom suspended on the tree, and rejected by heaven and earth. (Calmet)'

(Josephus, [Antiquities?] vii. 9.) --- This author says that it was a pillar of marble; so that it is different from that which Doubdan (15) mentions, observing , that all who pass throw a stone at it. Thus was his vanity chastised! --- <i>Hand,</i> work. So Martial (viii. 51.) says of a vial! <i>Mentoris hæc manus est an, Polyclete, tua?</i> (Menochius) --- The same word is translated, triumphal arch, 1 Kings xv. 12. (G.[Calmet?])'

      v:032:
        - '2SA:18:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Is.</i> This was as much as to tell plainly that he was dead, (Menochius) or at least, a prisoner. But David understood him right. (Haydock)'

        - '2SA:18:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Wept,</i> in private. (Menochius) --- <i>Would.</i> David lamented the death of Absalom, because of the wretched state in which he died; and therefore would have been glad to have saved his life, even by dying for him. In this he was a figure of Christ weeping, praying, and dying for his rebellious children, and even for them that crucified him. (Challoner; St. Ambrose (de Ob. Valent.); Theodoret, q. 35.) --- David had presently ceased to weep for the son of Bethsabee, because he had reason to hope that he was saved. (Calmet)'

      v:010: '2SA:18:10 | 10 | 10 | And one saw this and told Joab, saying: I saw Absalom hanging upon an oak.'
      v:011: '2SA:18:11 | 11 | 11 | And Joab said to the man that told him: If thou sawest him, why didst thou not stab him to the ground, and I would have given thee ten sicles of silver, and a belt?'
      v:012: "2SA:18:12 | 12 | 12 | And he said to Joab: If thou wouldst have paid down in my hands a thousand pieces of silver, I would not lay my hands upon the king's son: for, in our hearing, the king charged thee, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy Absalom."
      v:013: '2SA:18:13 | 13 | 13 | Yea, and if I should have acted boldly against my own life, this could not have been hid from the king, and wouldst thou have stood by me?'
      v:014: '2SA:18:14 | 14 | 14 | And Joab said: Not as thou wilt, but I will set upon him in thy sight. So he took three lances in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom: and whilst he yet panted for life, sticking on the oak,'
      v:015: '2SA:18:15 | 15 | 15 | Ten young men, armour-bearers of Joab, ran up, and striking him, slew him.'
      v:016: '2SA:18:16 | 16 | 16 | And Joab sounded the trumpet, and kept back the people from pursuing after Israel in their flight, being willing to spare the multitude.'
      v:017: '2SA:18:17 | 17 | 17 | And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and they laid an exceeding great heap of stones upon him: but all Israel fled to their own dwellings.'
      v:018: "2SA:18:18 | 18 | 18 | Now Absalom had reared up for himself, in his life-time, a pillar, which is in the king's valley: for he said: I have no son, and this shall be the monument of my name. And he called the pillar by is own name, and it is called the hand of Absalom, to this day."
      v:019: '2SA:18:19 | 19 | 19 | And Achimaas, the son of Sadoc, said: I will run and tell the king, that the Lord hath done judgment for him from the hand of his enemies.'
      v:020: "2SA:18:20 | 20 | 20 | And Joab said to him: Thou shalt not be the messenger this day, but shalt bear tidings another day: this day I will not have thee bear tidings, because the king's son is dead."
      v:021: '2SA:18:21 | 21 | 21 | And Joab said to Chusi: Go, and tell the king what thou hast seen. Chusi bowed down to Joab, and ran.'
      v:022: '2SA:18:22 | 22 | 22 | Then Achimaas, the son of Sadoc, said to Joab again: Why might not I also run after Chusi? And Joab said to him: Why wilt thou run, my son? thou wilt not be the bearer of good tidings.'
      v:023: '2SA:18:23 | 23 | 23 | He answered: But what if I run? And he said to him: Run. Then Achimaas, running by a nearer way, passed Chusi.'
      v:024: '2SA:18:24 | 24 | 24 | And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman that was on the top of the gate upon the wall, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running alone.'
      v:025: '2SA:18:25 | 25 | 25 | And crying out, he told the king: and the king said: If he be alone, there are good tidings in his mouth. And as he was coming apace and drawing nearer,'
      v:026: '2SA:18:26 | 26 | 26 | The watchman saw another man running, and crying aloud from above, he said: I see another man running alone. And the king said: He, also, is a good messenger.'
      v:027: '2SA:18:27 | 27 | 27 | And the watchman said: The running of the foremost seemeth to me like the running of Achimaas, the son of Sadoc. And the king said: He is a good man: and cometh with good news.'
      v:028: '2SA:18:28 | 28 | 28 | And Achimaas crying out, said to the king: God save thee, O king. And falling down before the king with his face to the ground, he said: Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath shut up the men that have lifted up their hands against my lord the king.'
      v:029: '2SA:18:29 | 29 | 29 | And the king said: Is the young man, Absalom, safe? And Achimaas said: I saw a great tumult, O king, when thy servant Joab sent me thy servant: I know nothing else.'
      v:030: '2SA:18:30 | 30 | 30 | And the king said to him: Pass, and stand here.'
      v:031: '2SA:18:31 | 31 | 31 | And when he had passed, and stood still, Chusi appeared: and coming up, he said: I bring good tidings, my lord the king: for the Lord hath judged for thee this day, from the hand of all that have risen up against thee.'
      v:032: '2SA:18:32 | 32 | 32 | And the king said to Chusi: Is the young man, Absalom, safe? And Chusi answering him, said: Let the enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against him unto evil, be as the young man is.'
      v:033: '2SA:18:33 | 33 | 33 | The king therefore being much moved, went up to the high chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went, he spoke in this manner: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}My son, Absalom; Absalom, my son: would to God that I might die for thee, Absalom my son, my son Absalom.'

      v:005:
        - '2SA:19:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Shamed;</i> deceived the expectations. See Joel ii. 12. Joab was one of those who spoil all their services by ostentation and rudeness. Like the first Anthony, <i>Immodicus linguâ, obsequii insolens, nimius commemorandis quæ meruisset.</i> (Tacitus, Hist. iv.) --- He speaks to David, his king, as one friend would not do to another. "That sort of men is truly odious, who upbraid with their kindness; which those who have experienced, rather than the authors, ought to remember." (Cicero, Amicit.)'
      v:006:
        - '2SA:19:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Thee.</i> What insolence! Kings are often forced to brook the affronts of their higher servants, as well as other masters. There is a gradation in human affairs, which makes the next in dignity and power think himself equal to the highest. <i>Similis ero altissimo,</i> Isaias xiv. 14. (Haydock) --- David sincerely desired the welfare of all his people, as well as of Absalom. (Menochius)'
      v:007:
        - '2SA:19:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>To.</i> (<i>satisfac</i>). Hebrew, "speak to the heart," &c., with a cheerful countenance, to testify that their services will be rewarded. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - '2SA:19:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Israel,</i> the rebels, as distinguished form Juda, or those who adhered to David; though many of all the tribes had sided with Absalom, ver. 11. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - '2SA:19:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Silent;</i> inactive and indifferent, as this word often denotes, Josue x. 12. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - '2SA:19:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Priests,</i> whose influence was very great. (Haydock) --- <i>Last.</i> David, like an able politician, shews the men of his own tribe, how dishonourable it will be for them to be outdone by the rest. (Calmet) --- <i>Talk:</i> reported by a solemn embassy. (St. Jerome, Trad.) (Menochius) --- Septuagint {GREEK:START logos}λογοσ{GREEK:END}, "the word, (Haydock) council," &c. (Salien)'
      v:013:
        - "2SA:19:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Flesh?</i> Amasa was his nephew, and as he had been appointed general by Absalom, his influence would be the greatest to bring back those who had given into the delusion. A sense of his misconduct would also render him more humble, and easier to manage than Joab, whose insolence caused him to be insupportable to the king. David designed to transfer the authority of the latter, (Calmet) which he had now enjoyed 23 years, since the taking of Sion. David's promise did not oblige him to keep Joab in that office for life, if his conduct should prove unsatisfactory. Hence he appointed Amasa to pursue the rebels, and afterwards Abisai, setting Joab aside. But the haughty warrior supplanted both, and retained the command, as it were in spite of his sovereign, chap. xx. 4, 15., &c. (Haydock)"
      v:014:
        - '2SA:19:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>And he;</i> God, David, or rather Amasa. (Calmet) --- All contributed, in different degrees, to bring about this happy union. (Haydock)'

        - "2SA:19:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Galgal,</i> and thence proceeded across the Jordan, (Calmet) an hour and a half's walk. (Menochius)"
      v:016:
        - '2SA:19:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Semei,</i> who had cursed David in his adversity, is now ready to fawn upon him, when he sees him restored to his throne. He was chief of a thousand, in Benjamin.'
      v:017:

      v:020:
        - '2SA:19:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Joseph.</i> Semei was a Benjamite: but Joseph designates all the Israelites, except those of Juda, (Worthington) as these two possessed the birth-right of Ruben, 1 Paralipomenon v. 1. (Menochius) See Psalm lxxix. 1., and Zacharias x. 6. --- But we may translate with the Septuagint, "before all the house of Joseph." (Chaldean, Syriac, &c.) (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - '2SA:19:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Sons.</i> He refers to the preceding opposition of Joab, whom Abisai was beginning to imitate. (Haydock) --- <i>Satan;</i> adversary, Matthew xvi. 23. --- <i>This day.</i> Formerly, no one was to be put to death on days of rejoicing, and the prisoners were liberated when the king ascended the throne. A malefactor continued for a long time to be set free on the day of the passover, Matthew xxvii. 15. (Calmet) --- The Romans would never punish any one with death, on the days "whenever (Augustus) entered the city." (Suetonius lvii.) --- David considers this memorable day as a new epoch of his sovereignty, and will not suffer it to be rendered sorrowful. See 1 Kings xi. 13. (Haydock) --- The punishment of Semei might have had the most pernicious consequences, as the rest of Israel would have feared a similar treatment. (Menochius) --- (Salien, the year of the world 3010.)'
      v:023:
        - '2SA:19:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Die,</i> during my life, (Menochius) or by my hand, without some farther transgression. Hence the oath is worded, <i>I will not kill thee with the sword,</i> 3 Kings ii. 8. (Haydock) --- Solomon was charged not to let his crime pass unpunished. But he did not kill him till he had shewed his disobedience. (Calmet) --- The oaths of parents do not always (Haydock) pertain to their heirs. (Grotius)'
      v:024:
        - '2SA:19:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Feet,</i> which was very requisite in those countries, to prevent a disagreeable smell, for which the Jews were noted. (Martial iv. 4.) --- Ammianus (2) speaking of the emperor Marcus says, <i>Cum Palestinam transiret, fœtentium Juædorum et tumultuantium sæpe tædio percitur.</i> Some have thought that this odour was removed by baptism. (Basnage, T. iii. p. 194.) Roman Septuagint adds, "neither had he cut his nails, nor (made or) dressed his mustaches," or upper lip. The chin, as far as the ears, was not shaved by the Jews. To cut all the hair was a mark of sorrow, no less than to neglect dressing it. See Leviticus xxi. 5. (Calmet) --- By the external appearance of Miphiboseth, David might be convinced that he had indulged his grief for a long time; (Menochius) which might serve to remove the ill impressions which he had received against the helpless son of his friend Jonathan.'
      v:025:
        - '2SA:19:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Met.</i> Protestants, "was come to Jerusalem, to meet the king." (Haydock) --- But his usual residence was in the city, where Siba had left him, chap. xvi. 3. We should therefore translate, "And coming to meet the king at his arrival in Jerusalem." (Calmet)'
      v:026:
        - '2SA:19:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Despised.</i> Hebrew and Chaldean, "acted treacherously with me." (Menochius)'
      v:027:
        - '2SA:19:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>God.</i> It is not necessary for me to say any more in my defence. Thou art convinced of my innocence; and the accusation was in itself improbable, as I could never expect to be better treated by another king. I am resigned to abide by thy decision. (Haydock) --- I cannot complain. (Calmet)'
      v:028:
        - "2SA:19:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Death,</i> on account of Saul's persecution, and his sons assuming the purple; so that all his adherents might have been justly slain. (Calmet) --- <i>Cry,</i> as if I had been wronged. (Menochius)"
      v:029:
        - '2SA:19:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>More.</i> Hebrew adds, "concerning thy affairs. I have said, Thou and Siba divide the inheritance." (Haydock) --- Thou as the owner, Siba as the administrator, or steward, as he was before. (Jun. Malv.[Junius?; Malvenda?]) --- Sanchez thinks that David made a compensation to Miphiboseth, for what he left in the hands of his servant, as he did not wish to disturb the harmony of the day, nor to inflict any punishment on offenders. (Menochius) --- But most interpreters accuse David of injustice, in suffering Siba to reap the fruits of his perfidy, &c. (Salien) (Calmet, &c.) --- It is not probable, however, that he would deviate from his wonted generosity, nor suffer Miphiboseth to be injured, if he were convinced of his innocence. Perhaps he might judge it expedient that Siba should have a separate establishment, as he was now unfit to act in his former capacity, and had shewn some sort of affection towards his sovereign, when his own son, and most of his subjects, had revolted against him. (Haydock)'
      v:030:

      v:036:
        - '2SA:19:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>With thee.</i> He did not proceed as far as Galgal; (Haydock) but took his leave of the king, intimating, what we never witness at the present day, that he was too old to enjoy the pleasures of a court! (Calmet)'
      v:037:
        - '2SA:19:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Chamaam,</i> is supposed to have been the son of the good old man. (Calmet)'
      v:040:

      v:041:
        - 2SA:19:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Stolen;</i> as if the king were not the common father of all. (Salien)
      v:042:
        - '2SA:19:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>Nearer</i> related. (Haydock) --- <i>Us.</i> What advantage have we gained? or, what have you lost? (Calmet)'
      v:043:
        - '2SA:19:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Ten parts.</i> They might have said they were twelve tribes for one; and though the tribe of Juda was more numerous than many others, it was not equal to them all. (Calmet) --- But the disproportion was by no means so great as ten to one; so that the Israelites unjustly pretended, that they had so much greater pretensions to the honour of bringing the king to his capital, in a sort of triumph. David might perhaps have waited a little longer, (Haydock) and shewed less predilection for his own tribe. (Calmet) (Salien) --- But what obligation was there for either? He had been long enough from Jerusalem, and eager to return, as soon as Amasa brought to him the tribe of Juda, and several of Benjamin, ver. 16. What hindered the rest from coming in time? They seem to have pretended more loyalty than they really possessed; otherwise they would not have joined in every rebellion. (Haydock) --- <i>First.</i> Hebrew may be, "did not I first propose the bringing back the king?" ver. 11. (Calmet) --- <i>Israel.</i> Tostat says, it is probable Juda asserted that the king did not, at all, belong to Israel; and hence Seba repeated the words with indignation, chap. xx. 1. It is wonderful that David did not repress this altercation. Abulensis supposes that he leaned too much towards his own tribe; for which, if true, we behold he was soon chastised; as God is always ready to reward or punish his servants. (Salien) --- But all that David said is not recorded. He could hardly have continued silent. All his endeavours to appease the sedition were, however, rendered abortive, by the evil dispositions of his subjects. (Haydock)'

      v:007: '2SA:19:7 | 7 | 7 | Now therefore arise, and go out, and speak to the satisfaction of thy servants: for I swear to thee by the Lord, that if thou wilt not go forth, there will not tarry with thee so much as one this night: and that will be worse to thee, than all the evils that have befallen thee, from thy youth until now.'
      v:008: '2SA:19:8 | 8 | 8 | Then the king arose, and sat in the gate: and it was told to all the people, that the king sat in the gate: and all the people came before the king: but Israel fled to their own dwellings.'

      v:042: "2SA:19:42 | 42 | 42 | And all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel: Because the king is nearer to me: why art thou angry for this matter? have we eaten any thing of the king's, or have any gifts been given us?"
      v:043: '2SA:19:43 | 43 | 43 | And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said: I have ten parts in the king more than thou, and David belongeth to me more than to thee: why hast thou done me a wrong, and why was it not told me first, that I might bring back my king? And the men of Juda answered more harshly than the men of Israel.'

As soon therefore as rain fell, David was assured that God was appeased. He had suffered the bodies to hang so long, for that purpose, though commonly they were to be taken down before night. (Menochius) --- Respha is supposed, by some, to have guarded the bodies from spring till the rain fell in autumn. But the former opinion seems more plausible. We here behold the custom of watching by the bodies of the dead. See Homer, Iliad xxiii. --- <i>Beasts.</i> The gibbets were formerly very low. (Calmet) --- Thus Blandina was exposed to wild beasts. (Eusebius, Hist. v. 1.)'

Some think it was towards the beginning of David's reign, since he leads his men to battle; or the Philistines might have made an irruption into his dominions, about three years after the death of Absalom. (Calmet) --- David had offered to put himself at the head of the army, against his son, chap. xviii. 2. (Haydock) --- <i>Faint.</i> He was now sixty-four years old. (Salien)"

        - '2SA:21:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Jesbibenob</i> may signify, "Jesbi, the son of Ob." Septuagint, "Jesbe, of Nob, who was of the race of the giants."

Sicles is only understood, as on similar occasions. Neither is <i>sword</i> expressed; (Haydock) so that some think he had on a new suit of armour. Symmachus, "a sword." Roman Septuagint, "a club." The weight of the whole spear is specified in Hebrew, Septuagint, &c., (Calmet) as weighing "300---of brass," (Haydock) of which metal it seems to have been formed, as the Jews had no such money till after the captivity. (Calmet)'

(Calmet) --- Septuagint (Alexandrian) reads, Geth. (Haydock) --- <i>Sobochai,</i> one of David's valiant men, 1 Paralipomenon xi. 29. --- <i>Saphai</i> is added in 1 Chron. xx."
      v:019:
        - "2SA:21:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Adeodatus, the son of Forrest.</i> So it is rendered in the Latin Vulgate, by giving the interpretation of the Hebrew names, which are Elhanan, the son of Jaare. (Challoner) --- We should translate all the proper names, or none; as the present mode is extremely perplexing. Adeodatus might therefore be rendered, \"God given;\" (<i>Dieudonn</i>é, as the French have it, though they will not translate <i>Saltus,</i> but leave <i>Jaare</i>) or, if <i>Adeodatus</i> must remain, as it is sometimes a proper name, why may not <i>Saltus?</i> A mere English reader might suppose that <i>Forrest</i> was a Hebrew name, and, with Swift in jest, maintain the high antiquity of our language. (Haydock) --- Regularly proper names should be retained. (Calmet) --- But the learned have often chosen to give the import of foreign names, in the language in which they have been writing. See Du Thou's History. Thus <i>Dubois</i> is styled Sylvius; Newman, Neander; &c. --- <i>An embroiderer.</i> Protestants make this a part of the man's name, \"Jaare-oregim.\" Septuagint, \"the son of Ariorgeim.\" In 1 Paralipomenon xx, no notice is taken of his profession. (Haydock) --- That passage will evince that <i>Elhanan</i> is not the same with David, as some would infer from the mention of Goliath's death, but the son of Jair, uncle of Joab, (chap. xxxiii. 24.) who was born at Bethlehem, though the verse in Paralipomenon would insinuate less correctly, that the giant's name was Lechem, thus, \"Elehanan....slew Lechem, the brother,\" &c., as the copyist had written <i>ath</i> instead of <i>bith.</i> (Calmet) --- Our version has not this mistake: \"Adeodatus, the son of Saltus, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath, the Gethite,\" &c., 1 Paralipomenon xx. 5. (Haydock) --- \"It would be difficult to find a passage more disfigured than the present; and, without the help of the Paralipomenon, it would be impossible to make it out.\" (Calmet) --- Kennicott makes a similar remark. (Diss. i. and ii.) But he believes that the Book of Chronicles, though the latest, and usually the most corrupt, of the Old Testament, is here perfectly correct; and that the passage before us is strangely corrupted, \"Jaare Oregim, a Bethlehemite,\" being placed instead of , ...\"Jaor slew Lahmi,\" as he thinks that <i>oregim,</i> \"weavers,\" has been inserted from the line below, p. 79. Josephus ([Antiquities?] vii. 10.) relates this transaction as follows, \"When the king had sent a fresh army against them, Nephan, his relation, displayed the greatest valour. For engaging in a single combat with the bravest man of the Philistines, and killing his antagonist, he caused the rest to turn their backs, and many of the enemy fell in that battle.\" Thus he evades all the difficulty, adding much out of his own head; and by Nephan, designating <i>Elehanan, the son of his</i> (Joab's) <i>uncle,</i> (chap. xxiii. 24.) or Dodo, a word which the Vulgate renders <i>patrui ejus,</i> \"his paternal uncle,\" though it hath a wider signification, and denotes other relations. Hence, as Joab was the nephew of David, this brave man might be in the same degree, and born of one of the children of Isai; or, perhaps, Josephus infers that he was a kinsman of David, because he was of the same city. (Haydock) --- <i>Goliath.</i> He might have the same name as his brother, who had been slain by David forty-three years before; (Salien) or the title of <i>brother</i> may only signify, that this giant resembled the former in size and strength, Proverbs xviii. 9. --- <i>Beam.</i> See 1 Kings xvii. 7. (Calmet)"

Capel would read, "a man of Madian." --- <i>Six.</i> Such people were styled <i>Sedigiti,</i> among the Romans. The daughters of Horatius were thus distinguished, as well as the poet Volcatius.

      v:002: '2SA:21:2 | 2 | 2 | Then the king calling for the Gabaonites, said to them: (Now the Gabaonites were not of the children of Israel, but the remains of the Amorrhites: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and the children of Israel had sworn to them, and Saul sought to slay them out of zeal, as it were, for the children of Israel and Juda.)'
      v:003: '2SA:21:3 | 3 | 3 | David, therefore, said to the Gabaonites: What shall I do for you? and what shall be the atonement for you, that you may bless the inheritance of the Lord?'

      v:005: '2SA:21:5 | 5 | 5 | And they said to the king: The man that crushed us and oppressed us unjustly, we must destroy in such manner, that there be not so much as one left of his stock in all the coasts of Israel.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "2SA:22:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Spoke,</i> &c. By comparing this with the 17th Psalm, we may be convinced how much the Hebrew varies, particularly if we examine also the manuscripts. Kennicott specifies no less than 600 variations in this one canticle, and refutes the opinion of those who say that the 17th Psalm is a second edition, corrected by David's own hand, as the manuscripts frequently shew the inaccuracies of the printed copies. He has collated them with Walton's Polyglott. The variations are not however all distinct from each other, sometimes twenty manuscripts having the same various readings, and many of them relate to the letter <i>v.</i> See Diss. ii., p. 565. We shall give the explication in the order of the Psalms. The collation of parallel passages is of infinite advantage. Frequently (Haydock) the words differ so as to explain one another. --- <i>Saul.</i> He is specified as the most dangerous. David, by divine inspiration, thanks God for his deliverance from all his enemies, both corporal and spiritual, enjoying peace of mind on account of his sins being forgiven, and all his opponents repressed. (Worthington) --- This year, the thirty-seventh of David's reign, was free from any commotion. Yet the king seems to have given way to a little vanity, on account of the many valiant men whom God had collected in his service; (chap. xxiii.) and hence he consented to the unfortunate resolution of numbering his subjects. (Salien, the year of the world 3016.)"

        - "2SA:23:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Last words,</i> which he spoke by inspiration, (Menochius) or which may be considered as the conclusion of his Psalms, and inserted after the 71st, (Calmet) or as a preface or summary of those divine canticles; (Du Hamel) or they relate to the last ages, and to the Messias, (Chaldean) <i>the end of the law.</i> (Haydock) --- Some think it has not been inserted among the Psalms, as not being written in verse: (Sanctius) but it is composed in the true spirit of the Hebrew poetry, though very obscure. --- <i>Christ,</i> who should be born of him; or David himself was appointed to be \"the king\" of God's people. Septuagint, \"he whom God raised up, the Christ of,\" &c. Hebrew, \"sovereign anointed of,\" &c. --- <i>Psalmist.</i> The Holy Spirit directs David to speak in his own praise. His Psalms were always most highly esteemed in Israel. (Calmet) --- <i>Said.</i> This preamble may remind us of a similar one of Balaam, Numbers xxiv. 3. The prophets generally declare who they are. (Haydock)"
      v:002:
        - 2SA:23:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Tongue.</i> Nothing could more decisively prove the inspiration of the sacred books.
      v:003:
        - '2SA:23:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Strong one.</i> This is one of the most common titles of God, 1 Kings ii. 2. Hebrew, "the rock." --- <i>In the fear.</i> Hebrew, "of the fear;" that is, of the just, who live in the fear of God. Such abstract expressions are frequent; so "the son of the captivity, of riches," &c., means a captive or a rich man. (Calmet) --- God spoke such words to David as tended to promote solid virtue and piety. (Haydock) --- We may explain <i>the ruler,</i> &c., of the Messias, who shall diffuse grace and glory throughout the earth. Protestants, "He that ruleth over men, <i>must be</i> just, ruling in the fear of God." An excellent lesson for all in power. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - '2SA:23:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>As the light,</i> &c. So shall be the kingdom of Christ. (Challoner) --- Hebrew, "Like the morning light, shall the sun arise." But is this sense? Is not the sun the light of the morning? The oldest Hebrew manuscript in England has the word <i>Jehova</i> before <i>Sun,</i> which seems to have been acknowledged by the Septuagint, though now unintelligible; and thus we are freed from this difficulty, and the passage is proved to be prophetical of the great sun of justice, Malachias iv. 2., and Isaias lx. 2. (Kennicott, Dis. i., p. 471.) --- The Hebrew is extremely obscure. (Calmet) --- Protestants, And <i>he shall be</i> as the light of the morning, <i>when</i> the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; <i>as</i> the tender grass <i>springeth</i> out of the earth by clear shining after rain. (Haydock) --- These comparisons may be applied to the Psalms and other inspired writings, which enlighten the eyes; (Psalm xviii. 9,) or to Christ, whose glory surpasses that of the sun, (Psalm lxxi. 5,) and whose graces produce the just, Isaias xlv. 8. (Menochius) --- We might expect that David was going to compare the glory of his reign and of his family, with that of the rising sun, Judges v. 31. But he does not finish the comparison, being filled with a sense of his own misery. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - '2SA:23:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Neither is my house,</i> &c. As if he should say: This everlasting covenant was not due to my house: but purely owing to his bounty, who is all my salvation, and my will; that is, who hath always saved me, and granted me what I desired of him; so that I and my house, through his blessing, have sprung up, and succeeded in all things. (Challoner) --- He clearly distinguishes between the covenant made with him as to his earthy kingdom, and that which regards Christ. (Worthington) --- Even the former should be of long duration, Psalm cxxxi. 11. (Haydock) --- <i>Up.</i> Hebrew seems to contradict all that had gone before; "for it shall not flourish." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "although he make <i>it</i> not to grow;" (Haydock) unless we read with an interrogation, "And shall not my family flourish?" which was a natural reverence to ver. 4. (Calmet) --- God had blessed David with the dew of heaven, and with the fatness of the earth. (Menochius) --- His glory and happiness should not be of short duration, like the brightest summer-day, or a transient flower. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - '2SA:23:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>But.</i> This word is neglected by the Septuagint, who enjoin this to the preceding verse. "Because the lawless man shall not flourish. They are all like thorns thrust out, for they shall not be handled," lest they prick. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - "2SA:23:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Jesbaham,</i> the son of Hachamoni. For this was the name of this hero, as appears from 1 Chronicles xi. 11. (Challoner) --- But then <i>sitting,</i> &c., should not be retained. (Haydock) --- <i>Most tender,</i> &c. He appeared like one tender and weak, but was indeed most valiant and strong. It seems the Latin has here given the interpretation of the Hebrew name of the hero, to whom <i>Jesbaham</i> was like, instead of the name itself, which was <i>Adino</i> the <i>Eznite,</i> one much renowned of old for his valour. (Challoner) --- The Vulgate has, contrary to custom, translated many of the proper names. (Calmet) --- The French version would suppose that Adino, the Heznite, was the hero's name; and queen Elizabeth's version (1599) is, \"He that sat in the seat of wisdom, being chief of the princes, was Adino, the Eznite.\" (Haydock) --- But no such person is mentioned any where else, in the Bible; and these words have been corrupted, like many others in this chapter, as may be gathered from collating it with Chronicles, &c. Kennicott was encouraged to continue, if not to begin his labours, to shew the imperfection of the printed Hebrew, by comparing these passages, though he had formerly imagined that the text had been preserved in its original purity. See Diss. ii. p. 496. He shews the inaccuracy of queen Elizabeth's version, and observes that some have very abruptly inferred, that David was the first of his own mighty men, from the Vulgate, which is literally, \"These are the names of the valiant men of David. Sitting in the chair, the most wise prince among the three. The same is like the most tender,\" &c. No name is here specified, (Haydock) though the catalogue be given expressly to honour their names. --- <i>In the chair.</i> Hebrew <i>Bashebeth,</i> \"seems to be carelessly transcribed in here from the line above,\" as <i>Oregim</i> was taken from the subsequent line, chap. xxi. 19. --- <i>Wisest.</i> Hebrew, \"the Hachmonite.\" --- <i>Three;</i> it is in Hebrew, \"the third;\" and in Chronicles <i>thirty,</i> improperly. Protestants, \"the Tachmonite, that sat in the seat, chief among the captains, (the same was Adino, the Eznite) against 800 whom he slew at one time,\" is therefore inaccurate. --- <i>Tachmonite</i> has the <i>th</i> corrupted, from <i>e,</i> which stands for <i>ben,</i> \"<i>the son</i> of Hachmoni;\" though, as the father of Jashobeam was Zadiel, it would be better rendered the Hachmonite, being his family or local name. It is not always possible to know which is meant. The ellipsis in the Protestant version, and the confounding of Jashobeam with Adino, cannot be excused. <i>Adinu</i> seems to be (Haydock) corrupted from <i>áuror,</i> (as ver. 18, and 1 Paralipomenon) \"lifted up;\" <i>eatsnu,</i> a word retained in the Arabic language, for \"his spear;\" (Vulgate) <i>wood.</i> Le Clerc reads <i>eatsni,</i> which he deems inexplicable, no less than <i>Adinu:</i> but the best copies have <i>eatsnu;</i> so that we need not reject it. --- <i>Killed,</i> or \"wounded,\" is the general interpretation of <i>elol;</i> but it signifies also, \"a soldier.\" --- <i>Eight</i> is <i>three,</i> in Paralipomenon. Similar mistakes have probably arisen from the use of numeral letters. See 4 Kings viii. 26. We read, that <i>Abisai lifted up his spear against</i> 300. This was, perhaps, an usual number for a regiment of three companies, 1 Kings xxix. 2. Both Jesbahan and Abisai ventured to contend, singly, with so superior a force; but the latter displayed rather less valour, so that he did not attain unto the glory of the former; which he ought to have done, if both had killed the same number. Kennicott would therefore translate, \"These are the names of the mighty men, whom David had: Jashobeam, the Hachmonite, chief of the Three: He lifted up his spear against 300 soldiers, at one time.\" He observes that thirty-seven heroes are particularly specified: (ver. 39) Joab, (the captain-general) Jashobeam, Eleazar, Shammah, (the first ternary) Abishai, Benaiah, and Asael; (the second ternary) after whom follow thirty, whose exploits are not recorded. If any should still maintain that this verse is correct, we must say (Haydock) that Adino is a different person from Jesbaham, (as the Vulgate reads it, 1 Paralipomenon) and that he killed 800; whereas the latter was only <i>like</i> him, in as much as he slew 300. (Menochius) --- The marvellous is greatly diminished by substituting 300 instead of 800, and by allowing that the heroes contended with, though they might not kill, the whole company of 300 soldiers. See Kennicott. It seems most rational to admit some corrections, to which we are led by the Septuagint, \"Jesbaath, (Vatican, Jesbosthe, the Chanaanite) the son of Thakemoni. He was the chief of the three. <i>Adino, the Asonean,</i> is useless, (Calmet) as a proper name: when corrected, it is rendered, (Haydock) \"he drew,\" &c. Whence have they taken this, as it is not in Hebrew at present, unless they read, (Calmet) <i>áuror, elevavit,</i> \"he lifted up his spear.\" (Kennicott) --- The number of 300 slain by one man, in one engagement, is also more credible than 800. (Calmet) --- Josephus increases the number to 900; but then he supposes they were slain in various battles. \"The king had thirty-eight, chiefly renowned for their achievements....The first, Issaimos, the son of Achamani, who rushing, not once, but frequently, into the midst of the enemy, did not cease from slaughtering till he had killed 900.\" We may observe that he increases the number of the mighty men. (Haydock) --- Delany reduces it to thirty-six, though he afterwards reckons thirty-seven, erroneously making thirty-one commanders of the third order, when he ought to have allowed the odd one to be the captain-general, and placed him before the two ternaries. Lightfoot also reckons thirty-six, and mentions them in this remarkably false order: 1, Joab; 2, Adino, of Ezni, called Jashobeam, by office; 3, Eleazar. And in the second rank: 1, Abishai; 2, Shammah; 3, Benaiah. (Kennicott) --- All these officers were styled, <i>Shalischim.</i> See Exodus xiv. 7. (Calmet) --- A body of \"Thirty\" was, perhaps, originally formed by David; and, though he afterwards admitted a greater number, they all went by the first name. (Salien)"
      v:009:
        - "2SA:23:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Dodo.</i> In Latin, <i>Patrui ejus,</i> which is the interpretation of the Hebrew name <i>Dodo.</i> The same occurs in ver. 24, (Challoner) and signifies, \"of his paternal uncle.\" (Haydock) --- Septuagint read <i>Dudia,</i> (Calmet) \"of his father's brother.\" He, or his father, is styled Dudai, 1 Paralipomenon xxvii. 4. (Calmet) --- Septuagint (Alexandrian) translates both Dodo and Dodi, \"the son of his father's brother,\" the son of Sousei, or (Vatican) Doudei. Dodi seems to be the more accurate here, as he is thus more distinguished from Dodo, ver. 24., and Chronicles v. 26.[1 Paralipomenon xi. 26.?] --- <i>Defied.</i> Hebrew is incorrect, and ought to be a proper name as is evident from the word <i>there.</i> Josephus calls it, {GREEK:START arasamo}αρασαμο{GREEK:END}, (perhaps originally, {GREEK:START aphasdamo}αφασδαμο{GREEK:END}) Chronicles, Pasdammim, or Ephesdammim, 1 Kings xvii. 1. It is hardly probable that the Hebrews should defy or upbraid the Philistines, and immediately run away. We should therefore translate with 1 Paralipomenon <i>men.</i> \"He was with David at Pasdammim. And when the Philistines were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away, he arose,\" &c. (Kennicott)"

(Josephus) (Menochius) --- This verse, and as far as <i>troop</i> in the following, is omitted in 1 Paralipomenon; so that Semma is not so much as mentioned, (Haydock) and of course the number thirty seven cannot be found. (Kennicott) --- Perhaps Samaoth may be the same hero, 1 Paralipomenon ii. 17., and xxvii. 8. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - '2SA:23:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Troop.</i> Hebrew <i>Lachaya,</i> has been much controverted: but it appears to be the name of Lechi, or Lehi, "the jaw-bone," (Josephus and Septuagint Complut.) so memorable for the exploit of Samson. (Bochart, Anim. p. 1. B. ii. 15.) --- Vulgate literally, <i>in statione,</i> "in a station." Some copies of the Septuagint, "against wild beasts;" "To hunt wild beasts," Syriac and Arabic. But it is most probably the name of a place. (Calmet) --- <i>Lentils.</i> (1 Paralipomenon) <i>Barley</i> seems more correct, as the field could not be full of both at the same time; (Haydock) and barley is of more general utility. (Kennicott) --- Yet some would assert, that there was barley in one part and lentils in the other. (Buxtorf, &c.)'
      v:013:
        - '2SA:23:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Before this.</i> The exploits performed before the death of Goliath have been recorded. The following took place soon after the taking of Jerusalem. Hebrew simply, "And three of the Schalischim came to David at harvest-time, (Paralipomenon more correctly, <i>to the rocks,</i>) and into the cave," &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Three</i> is undoubtedly the proper word, though the printed Hebrew copies have <i>thirty</i> in the text; except the most ancient edition of Ximenes, 1515, which retains <i>three,</i> with all the versions, and some Hebrew manuscripts and as the ver. 17. itself reads <i>among</i> would be better <i>above;</i> (ver. 23,) as the three officers aforesaid were not of the body of thirty, but of a still higher order. --- <i>Harvest.</i> Hebrew <i>el Katsir,</i> is never used elsewhere in this sense; and the Septuagint have left the latter word as a proper name, "at Kasoar;" <i>etsur</i> seems to have been the original word, as in Paralipomenon, "to the rock." Such places had frequently caverns or strong holds, 1 Kings xxiv. 1, 4. --- <i>Camp.</i> The Septuagint also seem to have read <i>m</i>éne, as in Paralipomenon, instead of <i>eith,</i> which never occurs, for "a troop." (Kennicott) --- This camp was distant from the station at Bethlehem, (Menochius) which was distant from Jerusalem "two hours travel." (Maundrell) --- <i>Giants,</i> or Raphaim, 2 Kings xxi. 18. (Menochius)'

        - '2SA:23:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Garrison.</i> Literally, "station," (Haydock) or advanced guard. --- <i>In.</i> The <i>b</i> is omitted in Hebrew, as on many other occasions; (4 Kings xiv. 14.; Kennicott) owing perhaps to the following words beginning with the same letter. (Haydock)'

(Calmet) --- The three valiant men considered his desire as a law. (Menochius) --- They were not to be condemned of rashness, though it would have been such in ordinary men. (Salien) --- David only intended to try the valour of his soldiers. When they brought the water he would not drink, judging that precious things should be offered to God. (Worthington)'
      v:016:
        - '2SA:23:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Camp,</i> or station of soldiers, ver. 13, 14. --- <i>Offered it,</i> as "a libation," according to the Hebrew and Septuagint. <i>Vayasec</i> is commonly used; but <i>vinsoc,</i> in Paralipomenon is the truer reading, as "it contains the three radical letters; and it were greatly to be wished that the verbs in every other place had also those radical letters restored, which have been omitted by the Masorets, and supplied by their punctuations." (Kennicott, Dis. i. p. 154.) --- <i>Lord,</i> as a sacrifice, worthy of him, and to teach his followers to be temperate, (Menochius) and not to expose their lives unnecessarily. (Haydock) -- "He had formerly indulged himself in forbidden pleasures." (St. Gregory) --- David thus asked pardon for having, undesignedly, hazarded the lives of his men, (Kennicott) and gave thanks for their safe return. (Josephus) --- A libation of water was solemnly made, 1 Kings vii. 6. The pagans used water when they had no wine, as they never sat down to meat, or offered sacrifice, without making a libation. (Calmet) See Homer, Iliad <u><em>H</em></u>.; Virgil, Æneid viii. 279.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Dixit & in mens</i>â laticum libavit honorem. (Virgil, Æneid i. 740.)'

        - '2SA:23:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Drink.</i> This word is acknowledged in 1 Paralipomenon and in all the ancient versions. (Kennicott) --- Protestants supply, "<i>Is not this</i> the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?" Instead of <i>Jehova,</i> (Haydock) which ought to have <i>m</i> prefixed, we find <i>maleim;</i> (1 Paralipomenon) a word never used in such solemn appeals to the Lord. This seems owing to the superstition of the Jews, who would not pronounce the former name, perhaps in imitation of the heathens, who kept the names of their tutelar gods secret, lest the enemy might call them out, and thus obtain possession of the country. See Macrob. iii. 9. No mention is made of the Romans making use of this mode of evocation at the last siege of Jerusalem, as they were unacquainted with the true name of God. Virgil (ii. 351,) writes,---{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Excessere omnes Adytis Arisque relictis,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Dii quibus imperium hoc steterat.</i>----- See Servius; Kennicott.'

"Of the three he was more honourable than two; therefore he was their captain, and yet to," &c. Thus we see a double ternary fully established, ver. 8. (Kennicott)'

        - "2SA:23:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Banaias.</i> The <i>v</i> at the end of this man's name, is wanting in Paralipomenon. It serves to distinguish him more from one of the Thirty, who was the 11th captain in waiting on the king; (1 Paralipomenon xxvii. 14,) whereas this was the third, (1 Paralipomenon v.) and one of great renown, 3 Kings i. 32. --- <i>Lions.</i> Hebrew <i>ari,</i> \"a lion;\" and <i>el,</i> \"god,\" designate people \"of extraordinary valour.\" (Kennicott) --- Hence the Arabians give the title to Ali, the son-in-law of Mahammed.

(Calmet) --- Some suppose that he slew three real lions. The last, being in such a confined situation, enhanced his merit. (Cajetan) (Menochius) --- The Alexandrian copy of the Septuagint has a great omission of the words between <i>slew,</i> occasioned by the word recurring twice; as also ver. 21. Dr. Milles attributes the omission of the famous text 1 John v. 7, to a similar case; {GREEK:START marturountis}μαρτυρουντισ{GREEK:END}, being found in the subsequent verse. \"<i>Proclivi admodum errore, quod norunt, quibus cum veteribus membranis res est.</i>\" 2nd edition. --- \"A source of frequent mistakes, as all know who have consulted old manuscripts.\""

        - '2SA:24:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Stirred up,</i> &c. This <i>stirring up,</i> was not the doing of God, but of satan; as it is expressly declared, 1 Chronicles xxi. 1. (Challoner) --- David was moved by vanity, &c., thus to displease God. --- <i>Among.</i> Hebrew, "against;" as the king could have done nothing more prejudicial to his people, 70,000 of whom perished on this occasion, ver. 15. (Haydock) --- We might also translate, "The anger of the Lord continued against Israel: for David, for their misfortune, was moved to say, Go," &c., as this would obviate the harshness of the expression. (Calmet) --- However, as it is the same in the Septuagint, &c., and as similar words do not prove that God is the author of sin, we may explain this in the same sense, allowing that he suffered the evil to take place, knowing how to draw good out of it. (St. Augustine, &c.) (Haydock) --- Some take this <i>Satan</i> to be an evil counsellor. (Calmet) --- The devil may be styled "the fury of God?" as he is his creature, though rebellious.

The other editions vary. Hebrew means, "to the land of new subjects," or "lately conquered" (Junius) from the Agarites, (1 Paralipomenon v. 10,) which agrees with this situation. (Calmet; Lyranus) --- The commissioners first took an account of the tribe of Ruben, (Menochius) and then proceeded northward, till they returned from Dan towards the south. (Haydock) --- <i>Woodlands.</i> St. Jerome reads <em>j</em><em>á</em><em>r,</em> instead of <em>j</em><em>á</em><em>n.</em> By transposing a letter, <em>á</em><em>in</em> would signify <i>Dan,</i> "the spring," which feeds the Jordan.'

      v:009:
        - "2SA:24:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Eight....and five.</i> Theodotion says nine and four, which comes to the same sum. (Haydock) --- But 1 Paralipomenon xxi. 5, reads, <i>eleven hundred thousand, and four hundred and seventy thousand fighting men:</i> though even there the Arabic version has the number here specified, which is less incredible. The fighting men are not above a fifth part of the population; and we may allow that David might have about seven million subjects. It seems, therefore, best to abandon the latter number as incorrect, since all commentators confess that similar mistakes have been made by the transcribers; and to maintain the contrary, would be indirectly to throw the blame upon the sacred writers. (Calmet) --- Yet some account for the variation, by saying, that Joab gave not in the full number here, (Menochius; Abulensis; &c.) which seems contrary to the text, <i>there were found,</i> &c. (Haydock) --- Cornelius a Lapide supposes, that the excess of number was occasioned by the subsequent list of the Levites, &c. But could they amount to so many? (Calmet) --- And what proof is there that they were numbered, after the anger of God had manifested itself so severely? (Haydock) --- Others affirm, that Joab did not take an account of the 288,000 chosen out of the twelve tribes, that 24,000 of them might guard the palace by turns, in each of the twelve months, 1 Paralipomenon xxvii. 1. (Bochart, Anim. p. 1. B. ii. 37.; Grotius; &c.) --- But thus there will be 18,000 more than even in Paralipomenon, where we find in all 1,570,000, though the tribe of Juda have fewer, by 30,000, than in this book. To account for this, some say, (Haydock) the proselytes are here taken in, or the inhabitants of all the territory, which was at first assigned to Juda, Josue xix. 29. (Menochius) --- All this is conjecture, (Haydock) and must remain among the systems of history. (Calmet) --- If Joab chose to diminish the numbers of Israel, why has he increased those of Juda? Did he wish to flatter the king's vanity, or partiality for his own tribe? It is difficult to say what interest Joab could have in withholding the truth; and for the sacred historian to countenance his delusion, would expose us to the same danger of mistake, and overthrow the authority of Scripture, no less than if the author had been liable to error, and uninspired. It seems, therefore, most rational to suppose that we have here the true list of the warriors, and that the book of Paralipomenon has been injured by the negligence of transcribers, as it has on many other occasions. (Haydock)"
      v:010:
        - "2SA:24:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>David's heart struck him, after the people were numbered.</i> That is, he was touched with a great remorse for the vanity and pride which had put him upon numbering the people. (Challoner) --- His sin must have been internal, and probably involved a secret confidence in his riches and power, without referring all to God, (Haydock) or trusting entirely in him. (St. Ambrose, pœn. c. 9.; St. Augustine, contra Faust. xxii. 66., &c.) --- There was otherwise no prohibition for David's taking this account, (Calmet) which is so natural for a prince, and may frequently prove of great service. (Haydock) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] vii. 13.) and others assert, that he neglected to require the payment of half a sicle. (Tirinus; Estius) --- But where does God complain of this neglect? and how do they know that the injunction which was once given to Moses, when the tabernacle was to be furnished, (Exodus xxx. 12.) was to remain in force afterwards? Oleaster (on Exodus) says David acted against God's intention, who had promised that the Israelites should be innumerable. But this reason seems childish; and did not the king abstain, on that very account, from numbering any but those who were fit for war? (1 Paralipomenon xxvii. 23.) (Calmet) --- <i>Struck him.</i> Contrition and confession are specified here, as satisfaction is, ver. 12. Temporal sufferings are inflicted, even after the sin has been remitted, ver. 16.

        - "2SA:24:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Seven.</i> Paralipomenon, <i>three;</i> which makes the contrast more striking. (Haydock) --- The Septuagint, and some copies of the Arabic version, have the latter number. (Calmet) --- Gad might first propose seven, and then reduce it to three. (Menochius) --- But did the prophet deliver the message twice? Usher pleads for the truth of both numbers, though he says, \"It was always my opinion, that the Hebrew copy of the Old Testament has been no less exposed to the errors of writers, than that of the New, and all other books.\" (Synt. p. 219.) Boxtorf also declares, \"it is better piously to believe that both is right.\" Why? \"because both is written.\" (Antic. p. 401 and 420!) The contradiction, in fact, seems to have been occasioned by the mistake of a numeral letter, <i>g</i> (3) for <i>z</i> (7). (Kennicott) --- Usher, Malvenda, &c., adopt an hypothesis, beautiful enough, but destitute of proof, when they say that God proposed three years in <i>punishment</i> of David's criminal curiosity. But as that famine would have immediately followed the three years' scarcity, already endured, (chap. xxi.) and during the seventh, or sabbatical year, nothing could be reaped, the famine would thus rage for seven years. (Calmet) Salien places the 62nd sabbatical year at this very time, the year of the world 3017, and terminates the famine occasioned by the cruel injustice of Saul, the year before Christ 1013, which cannot agree with the aforesaid system.

Moria was his property, and seems not to have been much inhabited. It was not yet enclosed within the city walls. Here David saw the angel, in the air, ready to strike the inhabitants, and heard the voice from heaven. (Calmet) --- He had already witnessed the death of many in the city, 1 Paralipomenon xxi. 14. The angel waited for God's orders how many to destroy.

      v:018:
        - '2SA:24:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Altar.</i> This was done by a positive order. People still had the liberty of sacrificing on the heights of Gabaon. (Calmet) --- This place was honoured with the tabernacle; and David would have gone thither, if he had not been so much terrified, 1 Paralipomenon xxi. 30. (Haydock)'
      v:022:
        - '2SA:24:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Wain.</i> So Josephus reads. Septuagint, "wheels." Hebrew, "rollers," to beat out the corn. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "threshing instruments, and <i>other</i> instruments of the oxen for wood." Paralipomenon adds, that Areuna offered wheat, and saw the angel, as his four sons, and probably most of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, did.'
      v:023:
        - '2SA:24:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>As a king.</i> Literally, king Areuna:" <i>e</i> may have been substituted for <i>c,</i> "like," though the latter word is often understood. (Haydock) --- Some suppose that he was formerly king of the Jebusites, (Vatable) or one of their descendants, (Grotius) or possessed of great riches, &c. But why is the title never given to him elsewhere? (Bochart) --- The Septuagint, Syriac, and many Latin copies, do not recognize it; nor was it found in the Chaldean, in the 12th age [12th century]. Yet without making any changes, we may translate, "O king, Areuna has given all these things to the king." The Jews often speak of themselves in the third person, out of respect. (Le Clerc.) (Calmet)'
      v:024:
        - '2SA:24:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Free-cost,</i> or given gratis. This shews that subjects have property, otherwise they could only yield what was due to the king, as his own. (Worthington) --- <i>Silver.</i> Septuagint, "for the silver of fifty sicles." (Haydock) --- Bochart explains for the money of 50 sicles <i>of gold,</i> which make 600 sicles <i>of silver.</i> Gold was formerly as twelve to one, compared with silver. (Plato in Hipparcho.) --- But the best method of reconciling this passage with 1 Paralipomenon is to say, that David gave the 50 sicles for the oxen and floor, and afterwards purchased the whole piece of ground for 600 (Calmet) sicles of gold, (or 902<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> sterling.; Haydock) being informed that the temple was to be erected there, (Calmet) where Isaac had formerly been brought to be sacrificed. (Menochius) --- We might also make a colon, or pause, at <i>floor,</i> as if its price were specified elsewhere, and the fifty sicles were given for the oxen. (Du Hamel; Menochius) --- The sum amounts to only about 1<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> (Haydock)'
      v:025:
        - '2SA:24:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Holocausts;</i> a second time. The former victims had been consumed by <i>fire</i> from heaven, 1 Paralipomenon xxvi. 28. (Calmet)'

      v:017: "2SA:24:17 | 17 | 17 | And David said to the Lord, when he saw the angel striking the people: It is I, I am he that have sinned, I have done wickedly: these that are the sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I beseech thee, be turned against me, and against my father's house."

intro:
  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "This Book contains the transactions of David till the end of the pestilence, occasioned by his numbering the people, chap. xxiv. The last six chapters of the preceding book were probably written by Gad, who delivered God's orders to David, after he was deprived of the company of Samuel. Gad, Nathan, and other prophets, continued the sacred history, 1 Paralipomenon xxix. 29. After the unfortunate death of Saul, his general, Abner, instead of submitting quietly to the dominion of David, (Haydock) set the son of the deceased monarch upon the throne, at Mahanaim; and two years elapsed before the rival kings came to open war, chap. ii. 10. (Salien) --- David was 30 years old when he was anointed at Hebron, (chap. v. 4,) where he reigned seven years and a half over Juda. On the death of Isboseth, he was anointed a third time, as king of all Israel, and reigned in that character 37 years. (Haydock) --- The partisans of Isboseth might be excused in their adherence to him, as he was the son of the late king, and the election of David was not sufficiently notified to them. (Salien) --- We here behold the many virtues of David, and his repentance for some faults into which he had fallen. His predictions, and the names and exploits of many of his valiant men, are likewise recorded. (Worthington)"
