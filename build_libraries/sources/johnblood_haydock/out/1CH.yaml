    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1CH:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Seth.</i> Protestants, "Sheth, Enosh, Kenan:" but in Genesis they agree with us, which shews that the translator of the two different books is different, and that there is a want of uniformity in the plan adopted by king James I. (Haydock) --- The posterity of Cain is neglected, as it all perished in the deluge. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - "1CH:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Noe</i> begot <i>Sem, Cham,</i> and <i>Japheth.</i> (Haydock) See Genesis x. The author passes lightly over some of the descendants of the two latter, as he had David's genealogy principally in view."
      v:006:
        - '1CH:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Riphath.</i> Hebrew begins with D. (Calmet) --- But the Protestants correct it (Haydock) according to the book of Genesis and the Septuagint. The two letters are very much alike.'
      v:007:
        - '1CH:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Dodanim.</i> Hebrew has R, conformably to the Samaritan copy of Genesis, and the Septuagint translate the Rhodians. Yet Dodanim seems more accurate, (Calmet) and is retained by the Protestants. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - '1CH:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Earth,</i> first establishing the monarchy of Babylon, and building the castle. (Du Hamel)'
      v:012:
        - '1CH:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Philistines,</i> a colony from Crete.'
      v:017:
        - '1CH:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Hus</i> and <i>Hul</i> were the immediate sons of Aram, as well as....<i>Mosoch,</i> or <i>Mes;</i> (Genesis x. 23.; Calmet) so that there seems to be here some transposition. (Du Hamel)'
      v:018:
        - '1CH:1:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Sale.</i> The Roman Septuagint omits ver. 11 to 17, and ver. 18 to 24, having only, (<b>17</b>) "The sons of Sem, Ailam and Assur; (<b>24</b>) and Arphaxad, Sala." (Haydock) --- But the other copies here insert Cainan, as the father of Sale. See Genesis x. 24. (Calmet) --- It is a matter of great doubt whether he ought not to be inserted, Luke iii. (Haydock)'
      v:024:
        - 1CH:1:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Sem</i> begot <i>Arphaxad.</i> (Menochius)
      v:032:
        - '1CH:1:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Concubine.</i> She was his lawful wife, but of an inferior degree, and such were called concubines. (Challoner) --- She has the title of <i>wife</i>, Genesis xxv. 1. --- <i>And the sons of Dadan,</i> &c., seems to be copied from Genesis, as the addition is not found in many Latin manuscripts, no more than in the Hebrew or Septuagint. (Calmet)'
      v:036:
        - '1CH:1:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>And by.</i> This serves to explain the difficulty; as Thamna would otherwise seem to be a daughter of Eliphaz, though we know she was his concubine, Genesis xxxvi. 12. (Haydock) --- The Hebrew, Roman Septuagint, Syriac, and Latin, suppose that Thamna was the brother of Amalec; but the Alexandrian Septuagint has, "Now Thamna, the concubine of Eliphaz, bore Amalec." Arabic, "And Thamna, who was the concubine of Eliphaz, the son of Esau, bore him Amalec," which seems to be the true reading. (Kennicott) --- Hebrew, "And Timna and Amalek," (Protestants; Haydock) which confounds the sense. (Mariana) (Du Hamel)'
      v:038:
        - '1CH:1:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Seir,</i> not Esau, but the Horrite, (Genesis xxxvi. 20.; Menochius) which is added in order to explain the origin of Thamna. (Du Hamel)'
      v:040:
        - '1CH:1:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Dison.</i> We must add Oolibama, Genesis xxxvi. 25.'
      v:041:
        - "1CH:1:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Hamram.</i> In Genesis <i>Hamdan.</i> Two letters have been mistaken since the Chaldean characters have been adopted. (Calmet) --- On this occasion, we may briefly remark, <b>1.</b> The most learned fathers have admitted such mistakes in Scripture: yet these are not to be corrected by each one's private judgment, but we must all abide by the determination of the Church, which is plainly appointed for our guide in the infallible word of God. <b>2.</b> To obviate the objections of infidels, respecting the apparent contradictions of Scripture, particularly in these books, we must observe that many people and places had different names; <b>3.</b> And those who had the same were really distinct. <b>4.</b> Frequently also grandchildren, and those who have been adopted, are mentioned as the immediate offspring. <b>5.</b> Some mysterious numbers are specified, as fourteen in the genealogy of Christ, though the history allows more. <b>6.</b> Odd numbers are sometimes neglected. <b>7.</b> Often a part is put for the whole, or on the contrary; as Christ is said to have been dead three days, though he was only one whole day and part of two others: and in the reigns of different kings, in the same year, the different parts are assigned to each, as a whole year. <b>8.</b> Sometimes two reigned together, as Joathan ruled while Ozias was still living, (4 Kings xv.) and so both reigns are sometimes counted, and, at other times, their respective years. <b>9.</b> The interregnums are either omitted in calculations, or added to the years of the next ruler. <b>10.</b> Only the years that a person governed well are sometimes noticed, as Saul is said to have reigned two years, (1 Kings xiii.) though his administration continued much longer. Some of these rules may be applied to most of the scriptural difficulties, as the spirit of God could not dictate any falsehood. At the same time we must be forced to acknowledge that the Scriptures are <i>hard to be understood,</i> 2 Peter i. 20., (Worthington) and iii. 16.; and this may serve to exercise the genius, and to humble the pride of man. (Haydock)"
      v:043:
        - '1CH:1:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Israel.</i> The same remark had been made in Genesis xxxvi. 31. It is wonderful that the author of this work gives us no further information, when so many revolutions had since occurred. (Calmet) --- But he might content himself with repeating the words of Moses. (Haydock) --- The eight kings here specified must have reigned each 50 years, which is not impossible. David conquered the country under Adad.'
      v:048:
        - '1CH:1:48 | 48 | 48 | <i>River.</i> Euphrates is commonly so designated. See Genesis x. 11. (Calmet) --- Pagnin translates, "from the river Rohoboth." (Du Hamel)'
      v:050:
        - '1CH:1:50 | 50 | 50 | <i>Mezaab.</i> It is unusual for the Scripture to mark so particularly the genealogy of a woman. We might translate the Hebrew, "a native, <i>or</i> who was a native of Mezaab," which is probably the same with Dizahab, "abundance of gold," Deuteronomy i. 1. Mezaab signifies, "waters of gold," (Calmet) or "whose is gold," whence some infer that the woman was very rich, (Lyranus) or had discovered the art of drawing gold thread. (Abulensis) --- It is more probably a proper name. (Menochius)'
      v:051:
        - '1CH:1:51 | 51 | 51 | <i>Kings.</i> Hebrew, "Adad also died, and the dukes of Edom were duke Thamna, &c. (Haydock) --- This, and the following names, designate the place of their residence. (Menochius) --- The same forms of government prevailed in Idumea, as among the Hebrews, who had judges or dukes, then kings, and, after the captivity, dukes, till the time of the Machabees. (Tirinus)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1CH:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Israel,</i> "seeing, <i>or</i> valiant with God," was before called Jacob, or "a supplanter," Genesis xxxv. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - 1CH:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Aser.</i> They are not placed in the order of their birth. (Haydock)
      v:003:
        - '1CH:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Her.</i> The crime for which he was punished is not specified in Scripture. (Calmet) --- The Rabbins say that he was so enamoured of the beauty of his wife, that he treated her in the same manner as Onan did afterwards. (Cassian viii. 11.) --- It is supposed that he was slain by a devil, (Calmet) like the (Tirinus) impure husbands of Sarai, Tobias vi. 14. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - '1CH:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Zamri,</i> or Zabdi, Josue vii. 1. --- <i>Etham.</i> Similar names occur [in] 3 Kings iv. 30. But they seem to have been different persons.'
      v:007:
        - '1CH:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Achar,</i> alias Achan, (Josue vii.; Challoner) which was his real name, as the former was given him (Calmet) in consequence of his having "troubled" Israel. (Du Hamel) --- One letter may have been mistaken. (Worthington) --- It may seem more probable that Achar, which appears invaribly in the Vatican Septuagint and Syriac, is the proper name. (Kennicott) --- <i>Anathema,</i> the thing devoted or accursed, viz., the spoils of Jericho. (Challoner)'
      v:010:
        - '1CH:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Ram.</i> He is commonly called <i>Aram.</i> But it is to be observed here, once for all, that it was a common thing among the Hebrews for the same person to have different names: and that it is not impossible among so many proper names, as here occur in the first nine chapters of this book, that the transcribers of the ancient Hebrew copies may have made some slips in the orthography. (Challoner) --- <i>Juda.</i> Probably the first, appointed by Moses in the desert, Numbers i. 7., and vii. 12.'
      v:011:
        - '1CH:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Salma.</i> Septuagint have "Salmon," as it is written [in] Ruth iv. 20., and Matthew i. 4.'
      v:015:
        - '1CH:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Seventh.</i> Syriac and Arabic add, "Eliu, (chap. xxvii. 18.) and the eighth David." It appears, in effect, the Isai had eight sons, and that David was the youngest, 1 Kings xvi. 10., and xvii. 12. The Rabbins suppose that one was only adopted, namely, Jonathan, the son of Samma, noted for his prudence and valour, 2 Kings xiii. 3., and xxi. 21. (Calmet) --- One might die in his youth, and be therefore omitted, (Tirinus) as he had done nothing memorable. (Du Hamel) --- The Scripture does not always specify the full number. (Abulensis)'
      v:016:
        - 1CH:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Sarvia.</i> The honour shewn to the sisters of David is unusual. The father of the three valiant children of Sarvia is no where specified.
      v:017:
        - '1CH:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Ismahelite,</i> or more correctly, "Jethra, of Jezrahel;" (2 Kings xvii. 25.) though the Hebrew and Septuagint in that place read "Israelite," which would be a trifling remark; and it is improbable that Isai would give his daughter to a descendant of Ismahel. (Calmet) --- The person might, however, have resided among them. (Du Hamel)'
      v:018:
        - '1CH:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Caleb,</i> alias Calubi, ver. 9. (Challoner) (Worthington) --- He is different from Caleb, the son of Jephone. --- <i>Took,</i> &c. Hebrew, "begot Azuba, Ischa, and Jerioth;" or rather with the Septuagint, "took to wife Gazuba and Jerioth." (Calmet) --- Syriac and Arabic, "Caleb had Jerioth by his wife Azuba." We know that the latter was his wife, (ver. 19.) and this seems to be the true reading. As <i>ath</i> signifies "of or from," (Noldius) the Hebrew only requires a small correction. As it stands at present, it means, "Caleb begot Azuba, a woman, (or wife) and Jerioth." Protestants supply, "begat <i>children</i> of Azuba, <i>his</i> wife, and <i>of</i> Jerioth." (Kennicott) --- <i>Her sons.</i> The original determines us to read <i>her,</i> instead of "<i>his,</i>" as <i>ejus</i> would as naturally be understood. If Jerioth was not the wife, she seems to have been the daughter of Caleb; as <i>Jaser,</i> &c., were his <i>sons.</i> (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - '1CH:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Bezeleel,</i> the famous artist, (Exodus xxxi. 2.; Calmet) or a different person. (Du Hamel) --- The Rabbins, who confound Caleb with the son of Jephone, say that he espoused <i>Ephrata,</i> or Mary, the sister of Moses, when he was ten years old, that Ur and Uri had each a child at eight, and the Bezeleel began to work at the tabernacle before he was nine years old. (Lyranus) --- But this is extravagant, and the Bezeleel here mentioned was of the family of Hesron. (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - "1CH:2:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Machir,</i> grandson of Joseph, whose descendants occupied part of <i>Galaad,</i> (Haydock) of which he is styled the <i>father,</i> or prince. (Menochius) --- The daughter of Machir was probably an heiress, and Segub dwelt with his mother's tribe. (Calmet)"
      v:023:
        - '1CH:2:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Aram.</i> Protestants add "with the towns of Jair from them," the former possessors; (Haydock) or Gessur assisted Aram (Syria) in attacking Israel, 4 Kings x. 32. (Calmet) --- <i>All these</i> villages. Protestants supply, "<i>belonged to</i> the sons." Septuagint, "<i>were</i> of the sons." All these were dependencies of Machir, "prince" of Galaad; in which sense <i>father</i> is taken, ver. 24. (Menochius) --- <i>Sons</i> often denote nephews, &c. (Worthington)'
      v:024:
        - '1CH:2:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Hesron.</i> Perhaps it ought to be Azuba, ver. 19. Hebrew, "and after Hesron was dead, in Caleb-ephrata, then Abia, the wife of Hesron, bore him a (posthumous) son, Ashur, the father of <i>those who dwelt at</i> Thecua." He could not reside there himself no more than Caleb did at Bethlehem, which some, without proof, pretend was called Caleb-ephrata. The Septuagint agree with the Vulgate. They may signify that Caleb went to the town of Ephrata. But the son of Hebron[Hesron?] certainly never resided at Bethlehem. (Calmet)'

The descendants of Mesa inhabited Ziph, and those of Maresa dwelt at Hebron. The same remark will hold good in other places, where the names of places are put for those who occupied them. (Calmet) --- <i>And the sons.</i> Hebrew, "and of the sons of Maresa." (Vatable) --- But it may be as well explained in the sense of the Vulgate. Septuagint, "Marisa, his first-born.

Septuagint mention Manocho, Josue xv. 60. --- We may also translate "the father of Cariathiarim, the prince of half Manuchat, had sons who peopled different cities." It seems too harsh to call a man "half the place of rest," or "seeing from the moiety of rest," though the Hebrew has this literal signification. The Septuagint give proper names, (Calmet) "Araa, Esei, Ammanith," (but [in] ver. 55, half of Manath) and the Protestants, "Haroeh <i>and</i> half of the Manahattites."

The Vatican Septuagint is likewise interpolated, (2 Kings v. 14., &c.) by the insertion of eleven names from another version, and two names are twice repeated, so that we have 24 sons of David instead of 11.

      v:021:
        - '1CH:4:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Her.</i> Hitherto we have seem the possessions of the descendants of Phares. Those of Her inhabited the country rendered famous by the exploits of Samson with the jaw bone, Judges xv. 9. (Calmet) --- The first-born of Sela was called <i>Her,</i> after his unfortunate uncle, Genesis xxxviii. 7. (Haydock) --- <i>That wrought.</i> Septuagint take it for a proper name, "Ebdath." Hebrew, Beth-habodath habuts, "the house of the byssus, or fine linen manufacturers in <i>Beth-</i>Ashbáah," (Haydock) which is, perhaps, the same with Beersabee, "the well of swearing," Genesis xxi. 31. (Calmet) --- <i>Oath.</i> The Latin word <i>juramenti,</i> might be retained here, as well as <i>Calor,</i> chap. ii. 55. See 2 Kings xxi. 19. Septuagint read, "Esoba," as the proper name of a place.

      v:022:
        - "1CH:4:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>He, that made,</i> &c. viz., <i>Joazim,</i> the meaning of whose name in Hebrew, is, <i>he that made the sun to stand.</i> In like manner the following names, <i>Lying,</i> (Cozeba) <i>Secure,</i> (Joash) and <i>Burning,</i> (Saraph) are substituted in place of the Hebrew names of the same signification. (Challoner) --- The first etymology is not perfectly accurate, as Jokim means simply, \"he made to stand;\" Jachin, the pillar which Solomon erected, has the same import. (Haydock) --- Some injudicious person seems to have placed <i>the sun</i> in the margin, whence it has crept into the text. (Tirinus) --- It might be occasioned by the fable of the Rabbins, who assert (Haydock) that Elimelech wrought the like miracle as Josue, to convince the people of Bethlehem of the necessity of being converted; but, finding them incorrigible, denounced a famine, which forced him to retire with his family into the country of Moab. (St. Jerome, Trad., &c.) --- Elimelech died in that country; but these four descendants of Sela retired, probably, along with him, and returned afterwards to <i>Lehem,</i> or Bethlehem, as it is customary to omit a part of a word. (Tirinus) --- This town was peopled by different branches of Juda's family, ver. 4., and chap. ii. 54. (Calmet) --- <i>Lahem,</i> &c. Septuagint seem to leave the original terms: \"he made them return to Abedderim Athoukiim.\" --- <i>Who returned,</i> is also left as a proper name by the Protestants, (Haydock) &c. \"And Jasubi Lehem.\" (Vatable) (Menochius) --- It is not easy to decide, when the Hebrew words should be translated. --- <i>Old.</i> Hebrew, \"and ancient words;\" (Haydock) records, shewing where these families resided, (Calmet) unless this be also the name (Haydock) of a place.

But we have many examples of such a fall; (Haydock) and it is supposed, that these descendants of Sela were employed by the <i>king</i> of Babylon, at Nethaim and Gadera. (Calmet) --- <i>Hedges.</i> These are the proper names of the places where they dwelt. In Hebrew, <i>Netahim</i> and <i>Gedera.</i> (Challoner) --- Septuagint, "Ataim and Gadera." (Haydock) --- The correct Roman edition of the Vulgate prints these words, <i>plantationibus et Sepibus,</i> with large letters, to imply as much. (Menochius) --- <i>King;</i> David. (Sa) (Menochius) --- Many of the tribe of Juda attended David, while he was forced to flee before Saul, and to hide himself in unfrequented places. Some of them might be these <i>Yotserim,</i> or they might follow the profession of <i>potters.</i> (Haydock) --- "With the king they were powerful in his kingdom, and dwelt there." (Septuagint) (Haydock) --- The Vulgate often gives the meaning of proper names. (Du Hamel)'

      v:040:
        - '1CH:4:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Cham.</i> It is not certain that the Philistines, who came from the country of the Casluim, were descendants of Mezraim, Genesis x. 14. But it is very clear that the Egyptians sprung from Cham, Psalm lxxvii. 51.'

        - '1CH:5:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>And.</i> So Hebrew, &c., as f he was one of the princes. But the Vulgate seems to begin a new sentence, <i>Porro,</i> "now Bala." The possessions of this man must have been very extensive, from the Euphrates till (Haydock) Baal-meon, within nine miles of Hesebon, (Eusebius) almost (Calmet) as far as the Jordan. (Tirinus) --- Bala, or his descendants, extended their conquests as far as the Euphrates, which had been promised to Israel; and, under Saul, conquered the <i>Agarites,</i> who sprung from Agar.

(Calmet) --- It does not appear why the king of Juda is mentioned, as the people were not under his dominion, unless (Haydock) he was contemporary with Jeroboam II, as some assert.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1CH:6:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Levi.</i> The genealogy of the Levites is given with more exactitude than any of the preceding. Caath formed two branches, <b>1.</b> the priests, descended from Aaron; <b>2.</b> all his other children, who were simply Levites. (Calmet) --- Hence they are placed after the priests. (Menochius)'
      v:002:
        - '1CH:6:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Isaar,</i> or Aminadab, ver. 22.'
      v:003:
        - '1CH:6:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Abiu.</i> These died without children. The genealogy of <i>Eleazar</i> is given, as his family enjoyed the pontificate a long time, while that of <i>Ithamar</i> is neglected, (Calmet) as only Heli and a few others were raised to that dignity. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 1CH:6:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Eleazar.</i> The nine following generations to Sadoc may be immediate. (Du Hamel)
      v:005:
        - '1CH:6:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Abisue.</i> He is mentioned no where else. Josephus ([Antiquities?] v. ultra) calls him Abiezer. (Calmet) --- Many of these high priests were very obscure. (Menochius) --- <i>Ozi,</i> after whom Heli is supposed to have reigned, so that Zaraias and the three following were excluded, (Calmet) while Heli, and four of the same family of Ithamar, were acknowledged as high priests. (Tirinus) --- Abiathar was then forced to give place to Sadoc, (3 Kings ii. 26.; Haydock) whose family was in power at the captivity, ver. 15. (Tirinus) --- Nicephorus (ii. 4.) and Josephus ([Antiquities?] x. 11.) mention other high priests besides these. (Worthington)'
      v:009:
        - '1CH:6:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Azarias.</i> Perhaps the same who is called Amarias, (2 Paralipomenon xix. 11.) as <i>Johanan</i> is probably the illustrious Joiada, 4 Kings xi. 4.'
      v:010:
        - '1CH:6:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>This</i> may refer to either. (Calmet) --- The Holy Ghost gives an encomium to Joiada, for re-establishing the divine worship, (Junius) or to Azarias, for withstanding the impious attempt of king Osias. (Estius; Tirinus, &c.) (2 Paralipomenon xxvi. 17. (Menochius)'

      v:015:
        - '1CH:6:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Went out,</i> into captivity, while his father was slain, 4 Kings xxv. 18. More than 22 priests would be requisite to fill up near 900 years. See Salien.'

        - '1CH:6:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>The,</i> &c. This verse is repeated from ver. 2., as the author is now going to continue the genealogy of the Levites, in their natural order, (Haydock) to Samuel. (Du Hamel)'
      v:020:
        - '1CH:6:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Jahath.</i> See ver. 42, 43. --- <i>Zamma</i> springs from Semei, Jeth, Gerson, and has a son named Ethan, who has Adaia; as Zara begot Athanai, ver. 41. Almost all the names are rather different'
      v:022:
        - '1CH:6:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Asir.</i> While Core perished, his children were preserved, Numbers xvi. 30., and xxvi. 11. (Haydock)'
      v:023:
        - '1CH:6:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Asir.</i> This name seems superfluous (ver. 36., and Exodus vi. 24.; Calmet) perhaps taken from the preceding verse. (Haydock) --- The two former were sons of Core, ver. 25, 37. (Calmet)'
      v:026:
        - '1CH:6:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Sophai, Nahath,</i> and <i>Eliab,</i> are called Suph, Thohu, (ver. 34.; Calmet) and Eliel. (Haydock) --- Sophai may be a surname of Elcana. (Poole) (Du Hamel)'
      v:027:
        - '1CH:6:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Elcana, his son.</i> It seems necessary to supply, "Samuel, his son," (Haydock) as he descended from the 3d Elcana. (Du Hamel)'
      v:028:
        - '1CH:6:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Vasseni.</i> Some Latin copies subjoin "Joel," who was the first-born, (ver. 33.) (La Haye) --- Vasseni means, "and the second;" which can hardly be considered as the name of the eldest son, tough some have taken it as such, in like manner as they have explained <i>six,</i> chap. iii. 22. But then the <i>v</i> ought at least to be omitted, (Calmet) as it is in the Vatican and Alexandrian Septuagint, "Sani and Abia." (Haydock) --- Other editions insert "Joel," with the Syriac and Arabic. (Calmet) --- This person had therefore either two names, or Joel has been omitted, and we should translate "Joel and the second, Abia." (Menochius) --- These brothers acted so ill as judges, that the people took occasion to demand a king, 1 Kings viii. 3.'
      v:031:
        - "1CH:6:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>The singing.</i> Hebrew, \"the hands <i>or</i> places of the canticle,\" the two tribunes on each side of the altar. Heman presided over the band in the middle, while Asaph directed those on the right, and Ethan those on the left, ver. 33, 39, and 44. (Calmet) --- <i>Placed.</i> Hebrew, \"rested,\" as before David's time it had been carried about. He erected a tabernacle for it on Sion, and directed the Levites to attend in order, (chap. xxv.) so that some should be present every day (Menochius) to honour God, both by instruments and vocal music, while the priests performed their sacred functions with the utmost decency."
      v:033:
        - '1CH:6:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Heman.</i> Some families among the Levites were more distinguished than the rest, having authority to regulate the singers, and to give the tune. Hence many psalms are addressed to these masters of music. Yet from those titles we cannot surely infer that those psalms were composed by Asaph, &c. (Calmet)'
      v:034:
        - '1CH:6:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Eliel.</i> Many of the genealogies do not seem to agree in these first 10 chapters, as some more obscure names have been passed over, (Menochius) or the people had different names, or, through the fault of transcribers, some alteration has taken place, which could hardly be avoided, without a constant miracle. (Haydock)'
      v:039:
        - '1CH:6:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Brother,</i> or relation, though of the family of Gerson. He also followed the same profession as Ethan did, ver. 44.'
      v:044:
        - '1CH:6:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>Ethan</i> is also called Idithun (chap. xxv. 1, 8.[6.?]) in the Psalms. (Calmet)'
      v:048:
        - '1CH:6:48 | 48 | 48 | <i>Brethren.</i> All the other Levites, who were not Cantors. (Menochius)'
      v:049:
        - '1CH:6:49 | 49 | 49 | <i>Offerings,</i> which is here the meaning of <i>incensum;</i> as "incense" was not burnt on this altar, but only victims, Exodus xxix. 13.'
      v:053:
        - "1CH:6:53 | 53 | 53 | <i>Sadoc.</i> By God's ordinance Heli had been appointed. But the dignity still subsisted in Aaron's family. (Worthington) --- <i>Achimaas,</i> who was pontiff in the days of Solomon. This genealogy had been brought down to the Captivity, ver, 3, &c.) which shews that the author give extracts from different records."
      v:055:
        - '1CH:6:55 | 55 | 55 | <i>Suburbs,</i> or 2000 cubits round the city. See Josue xx., and xxi. (Calmet)'
      v:057:
        - '1CH:6:57 | 57 | 57 | <i>Of,</i> is not authorized by the Vulgate <i>civitates,</i> but is added, to signify that all these 13 cities were not thus privileged. (Haydock) --- There were only six cites of refuge, of which <i>Hebron</i> was one. See Josue xx. 7. (Calmet) (Menochius) --- Protestants, "And to the sons of Aaron they gave the cities of Juda, <i>namely,</i> Hebron, <i>the city of</i> refuge." But "such a licence to insert words at pleasure, cannot be allowed." Hebrew literally, "they gave cities of Hebrew refuge, Hebron," &c. The "sense absolutely disallows the word <i>Judah,</i>" which is omitted , (Josue xxi. 13.) as well as in some Hebrew manuscripts in the Bamberg and Complutensian editions, and in those of Jablonski and Michaelis. --- <i>Hari,</i> "cities," ought to be <i>hir,</i> "a city," as only one is meant. We should also add with the Arabic and Syriac, and the parallel passage in Josue, "and her suburbs," after Hebron. (Kennicott) --- "Juda" is not found in the Septuagint, &c.: and Buxtorf acted with little wisdom, when he thought he had sufficiently answered Capellus, by observing that the Masora declared the word to be authentic. (<i>Anticrit.</i>) It is a great misfortune that most of the printed Hebrew editions have been given under such influence; and that the Masorets have defaced so many manuscripts by their corrections. (Haydock) --- Hence they probably burnt all the first edition of Naples, 1487, except part of a single copy, comprising the Cethubim given to Eton college by Dr. Pellet, which omits the word Juda. (Kennicott, Dis. i. p. 520-2)'

      v:060:
        - '1CH:6:60 | 60 | 60 | <i>Almath.</i> Josue, <i>Almon.</i> --- <i>Thirteen;</i> but Geta and Gabaon are not here expressed, Josue xxi. 16, 17. (Calmet) --- Alexandrian Septuagint inserts, "Labee," before, and "Anchos, with its suburbs," after Anathoth, thus making 14; but these additional cities were not sacerdotal. (Haydock)'
      v:061:
        - '1CH:6:61 | 61 | 61 | <i>Out of.</i> We may supply, "the tribe of Dan, Ephraim, &c.," as only two cities belonged to Manasses, Josue xxi. 25. (Calmet) --- Double that number was taken from the two other tribes. (Menochius)'
      v:065:
        - '1CH:6:65 | 65 | 65 | <i>Them.</i> The priests, ver. 54. (Du Hamel) --- <i>Names.</i> Some being styled of the priests, (Calmet) other of the Levites, (Menochius) whose dominion as thus asserted. (Calmet)'
      v:066:
        - '1CH:6:66 | 66 | 66 | <i>The cities,</i> or rather "some cities," as all were not in the tribe of Ephraim. (Haydock)'
      v:067:
        - '1CH:6:67 | 67 | 67 | <i>Of the.</i> Literally, "cities to flee to, (<i>or</i> of refuge) Sichem," (Haydock) which might induce some to suppose that all these cities were of this description; but, in reality, only Sichem had that privilege. (Calmet) --- Septuagint is liable to the same ambiguity. See ver. 57., (Haydock) Josue xx. 7., and xxi. 21.'
      v:068:
        - '1CH:6:68 | 68 | 68 | <i>Jecmaan,</i> or <i>Cibsaim,</i> (Josue) as <i>Helon</i> is put for <i>Aialon</i> below. <i>And of the tribe of Dan, Eltheco and Gabathon</i> is omitted. See Josue xxi. 23.'
      v:070:
        - '1CH:6:70 | 70 | 70 | <i>Aner</i> and <i>Baalam,</i> perhaps the same as <i>Thanach</i> and <i>Gethremmon,</i> which were given <i>to the children of Caath of the inferior degree,</i> (Josue xxi. 26.; Calmet) or, <i>who were left</i> out of the rank of priests, (Menochius) or before unprovided for, as the partition was made at different times. --- <i>Baalam.</i> Hebrew, "Balaam." Septuagint, "Iblaam" is the Jeblaam, Josue xvii. 11.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1CH:7:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Jasub,</i> or Job. See Genesis xlvi. 13., and Numbers xxvi. 23. (Calmet) --- <i>Simeron,</i> elsewhere Samron and Semran; (Menochius) which shews, either that the names have been differently pronounced, or that the transcribers have erred. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - '1CH:7:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Chiefs.</i> They were at the head of distinct families. (Menochius) --- <i>David.</i> We know that David took an account of his fighting men, 2 Kings xxiv. But it is not certain that this register was made at that time; as we read that Benjamin was not numbered, chap. xxi. 6. These lists were probably made when some expedition was intended by David. The author was not, perhaps, able to recover the accounts of Nephthali, Manasses, and Ephraim, no more that the genealogies of Dan (ver. 12) and Zabulon, which do not appear in this book. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - '1CH:7:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Sons,</i> for "the son." (Du Hamel) --- <i>Izrahia.</i> He alone deserved to be mentioned. See ver. 6, where only three sons of Benjamin appear, though there were more, chap. viii. 2. (Tirinus) --- <i>Five,</i> comprizing Israhia, "all chiefs," (Haydock) men of note, (Du Hamel) or one name may be lost. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - '1CH:7:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Children,</i> who had numerous offspring; (Haydock) so that, in the days of David, these descendants of Thola, amounted to so many. (Menochius)'
      v:005:
        - '1CH:7:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>War.</i> In all, this tribe could muster 145,600 men, at that time. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - '1CH:7:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Benjamin;</i> a man, perhaps, of the tribe of Issachar. See ver. 10. Or the patriarch had originally ten sons, (Genesis xlvi. 21.) or grandsons, five of whom only had children, and perhaps two of their families perished entirely in the war with the other tribes; (Judges xx. 46.) so that, under David, only three branches were acknowledged. (Calmet) --- <i>Jadihel,</i> or <i>Asbel</i> in Genesis.'
      v:007:
        - '1CH:7:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Urai,</i> a grandson, called <i>Hir,</i> ver. 12. (Calmet) --- <i>Five chiefs,</i> but inferior to the <i>seven</i> original families, (Numbers xxvi. 38.; Menochius) unless the fortune of war had made great changes, or some of the lists be imperfect. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - '1CH:7:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>And Hapham;</i> called Mophim and Ophim, (Genesis xlvi.) and Suphim and Hupham, Numbers xxvi. 39. --- <i>Aher,</i> in Hebrew means, "another" son, called Hazim: or more probably Aher ought to be Dan, the father of Husim, (Genesis xlvi. 23.) as Dan and Nephthali had both the same mother, <i>Bala,</i> ver. 13. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - '1CH:7:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Son.</i> Hebrew, "sons....Ezriel, whom she bare." This seems imperfect. The Hebrews seldom name the mother. (Calmet) --- Septuagint intimate that the Syrian wife was mother of both. (Haydock) --- <i>Galaad,</i> whose posterity enjoyed the country of the same name, (Numbers xxii. 29., and xxxii. 41.) only Machir in mentioned as the son of Manasses.'
      v:015:
        - "1CH:7:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>And Saphan.</i> St. Jerome seems to have taken them for women. If they were the sons of Hir, (ver. 12) Machir probably adopted them. Hebrew, \"Machir took a wife from Happhim,\" &c. But does one woman marry two men? Syriac and Arabic, \"Machir took a wife one of the sisters of Huphim and Suphim, (the great and powerful) named Maacha.\" (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"<i>the sister</i> of Huppim....whose sister's name <i>was</i> Maachah.\" (Haydock) --- Hebrew may have this sense, with a small alteration. (Calmet) --- Le Clerc thinks that the name of the woman has been lost, and the text altered. --- <i>Second.</i> This also seems defective, as no first had been mentioned. (Calmet) --- Two intervened between Machir and Salphaad, namely, Galaad and Hepher, (Numbers xxvi. 29., and xxvii. 1.; Menochius) so that Salphaad was his great-grandson. (Haydock)"
      v:017:
        - '1CH:7:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Badan,</i> perhaps the same with Jair; (Judges x. 3., and 1 Kings xii. 11.; Calmet) or rather in this last place, the Syriac, &c., read more correctly Barac, and Samson instead of <i>Samuel,</i> who was then speaking. See Hebrews xi. 32. There was no such deliverer as Badan, but the word has been corrupted from Barac. (Septuagint) (Kennicott)'
      v:018:
        - '1CH:7:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Queen.</i> Hebrew, "Moleceth bore Ishehod." St. Jerome and the Latin Church translate these names. (Worthington) --- Protestants, "Hammoleketh bore Ishod." (Haydock) --- The proper names might have been as well retained, (Calmet) as in the Septuagint. (Haydock) --- Some suppose that the mother of Josue, or Debora, may be designated. (Rabbins) --- <i>Abiezer,</i> (<b>19</b>) <i>Leci,</i> are the Jeser and Chelek, Numbers xxvi. 30.'
      v:020:
        - '1CH:7:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Bared, Thahath,</i> probably called <i>Becher</i> and <i>Theken,</i> in Numbers. Three alone are there mentioned, though the other thirteen, whose names are given, seem to have been all the immediate sons of Ephriam, (Calmet) since he mourns for them, (ver. 22.; Menochius) and has other children afterwards. (Haydock) --- The dreadful slaughter made of them, is perhaps the reason why only three are mentioned in Numbers, and none in Genesis.'
      v:021:
        - '1CH:7:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Son, Ezer.</i> Hebrew, "and Ezer and Elad." <i>His son,</i> after each, seems to be twice omitted, as these were in the same degree as the rest. Septuagint agree with the Vulgate. (Haydock) --- <i>Because they,</i> the sons of Ephraim, (Calmet, &c.) or the <i>men of Geth.</i> (Syriac and Arabic) (Du Hamel) (Menochius) (Tirinus) --- The text is ambiguous, but the former supposition seems more rational, (Haydock) and more generally received. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - '1CH:7:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Beria.</i> This name signifies, <i>in evil,</i> or <i>in affliction.</i> (Challoner) --- <i>Briáe,</i> "in howling." (Menochius)'
      v:024:
        - '1CH:7:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Daughter,</i> or great grand-daughter, repaired these three cities. (Calmet) --- The last, probably, was called after her. (Haydock) --- But its situation is unknown. (Calmet)'
      v:025:
        - '1CH:7:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Thale.</i> Hebrew, "and Thale, his son, and Thaan, his son." These seem to have been the sons of Ephraim. The following were their descendants. (Haydock) --- At least Elisama was prince in the wilderness, (Calmet) under Moses; (Numbers i. 10.; Haydock) and Josue, the sixth from Ephraim, was 54 years old, when the Israelites left Egypt. (Calmet)'
      v:029:
        - '1CH:7:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Daughters.</i> Septuagint, "villages." --- <i>Joseph,</i> by Ephraim and Manasses, west of the Jordan. (Haydock)'
      v:034:
        - '1CH:7:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Aram.</i> Add, "and Helem," (Calmet) unless Helem was the first-born (ver. 35) of <i>Ahi,</i> which signifies "brother." Perhaps Helem was brother of Somer, called Hotham, ver. 32.'
      v:037:
        - '1CH:7:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Jethran.</i> Septuagint, Jether," as v. seq.[as in the following verse, ver. 38.] (Haydock)'
      v:038:
        - 1CH:7:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Jephone.</i> The father of Caleb was of the tribe of Juda. (Calmet)
      v:040:
        - '1CH:7:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Of captains;</i> a Hebrew idiom, to denote the most excellent. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "chief of the princes." All mentioned from ver. 30, were at the hand of their tribe, in succession, and led their brethren to battle. (Calmet)'

        - '1CH:8:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>And.</i> Literally, "but," <i>autem.</i> (Haydock) --- The sentence is clearer without this particle. (Menochius) --- <i>Naaman</i> was the first-born of Ahod; and Gera prevailed on his brethren to leave Gabaa, (Tirinus) and was probably the father of Oza. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - '1CH:8:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Saharim.</i> His father is not specified: but his was a Benjamite.

(Calmet) --- <i>Begot.</i> Protestants, "<i>children</i> in the country of Moab, after he had sent them away: Hushim and Baara <i>were</i> his wives." But the Septuagint intimate, that "Saharim begot....after he had sent away Osim, and his wife Baara, and he begot of Ada," &c. (Haydock) --- He had perhaps retired into Moab, at the same time as Elimelech, Ruth i. (Tirinus) --- Those who were sent away were men, (<i>eos</i>) according to the Hebrew, unless (Haydock) the word should be <i>eas</i>. (Du Hamel)'

      v:016:
        - "1CH:8:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Baria,</i> son of Elphaal. Whether the following were his brothers does not appear certain, as it seems more natural to have placed all his father's children together, ver. 12., and 18."

We find none of these names from ver. 14, in the days of Josue; and it was not easy for people to establish themselves at Jerusalem, till David had expelled the Jebusites. (Calmet) --- Yet we find that the tribes of Juda and Benjamin had seized the lower city long before, Josue xviii. 28. (Haydock)'
      v:029:
        - '1CH:8:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Dwelt.</i> Literally, "they dwelt."

(Menochius) --- <i>Abinadab,</i> or Jessui, 1 Kings xiv. 49. (Calmet) --- <i>Esbaal,</i> alias Isboseth. (Challoner) --- The Hebrews avoid pronouncing the name of the idol, and substitute <i>boseth,</i> "confusion." (Calmet) --- Hence it is clear that many had two names. (Du Hamel)'

        - '1CH:9:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Israel.</i> These registers were preserved by those who fled from the arms of Salmanasar, into the kingdom of Juda. Such records were preserved with the utmost care, and were collected by the author; who could give an account of what happened during and after the captivity, as he was an irreproachable eye-witness; not to mention the divine inspiration, which places his testimony out of the reach of criticism. (Calmet) --- <i>And Juda;</i> perhaps by some historian. (Menochius) --- <i>Babylon,</i> while Israel was removed elsewhere, by the Assyrians. (Haydock) --- The genealogies of Israel being hitherto recited, now those who came back from captivity appear. (Worthington)'

Many also retook possession of their lands, which they had enjoyed before the captivity, 1 Esdras iii. 12. --- <i>Nathineans.</i> These were the posterity of the Gabaonites, whose office was to bring wood, water, &c., for the service of the temple. (Challoner) (Josue ix. 27.) --- David and Solomon consigned others of the Chanaanites, whose lives they spared, to perform the same office. They were like public slaves. The number of those who returned was so small, that days were appointed for all the people to help to carry wood for the temple. At Jerusalem the Nathineans, "or people given," resided on the east side of the city; (2 Esdras ii. 26.) and other towns were assigned them, 1 Esdras ii. 70. (Calmet) --- The people continued to be divided into four classes, as they had been before the captivity. (Malvenda)'

The country was too spacious for them; and it was found necessary to force the tenth part of the people, by lot, to repair to Jerusalem, as it wanted inhabitants, 2 Esdras xi. 1.'

It is asserted that the priests and Levites could follow no mechanical profession, (Abulensis) and the Bacbacar only presided over the carpenters, who wrought in the temple. (Menochius) (Tirinus) --- But why might not people of this order employ themselves in such arts and labours, which were never deemed degrading among the Hebrews, nor incompatible with the sacred ministry, during the leisure hours?

So far the ancient records reach. Some would infer from this passage, that a guard was still kept at the king's gate, even though there was none sitting upon the throne after the captivity. (Calmet) --- Protestants, (\"who hitherto <i>waited</i> in the king's gate eastward.)

(Calemt) --- This Phinees lived after the captivity, (Menochius) and possessed the same power as Eleazar and Joiada, chap. xii. 27., and Numbers iii. 32. It is not necessary to refute the fables of the Rabbins, who pretend that the famous Phinees was an angel, who appeared at different times, and particularly at the return from Babylon.

(Calmet) --- He might also give private instructions to David for the same purpose; (Haydock) as Gad and Nathan did, 2 Paralipomenon xxix. 25. The same plans were still adopted, though the number of Levites was smaller. (Calmet) --- <i>Trust,</i> while they were at the head of affairs, and acting by God's authority.

      v:033:
        - '1CH:9:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>These;</i> probably Sellum, &c., (ver. 17) though it is not certain that the chief porters presided also over the singers, chap. xv., and xvi. Hebrew, "And these are the singers, chief of the families (Calmet; or fathers) of the Levites, in the chambers (of the temple) free" from all other avocations, (Haydock) that they may watch over the porters and musicians. Septuagint is clearer: (Calmet) "And these are the masters of music over the bands of Levites, observing their daily courses, because <i>they are</i> day and night over them in the works." (Haydock) --- The sons of Caath seem to be chiefly specified, (ver. 32) though other families sung, chap. vi. 39. --- <i>Chambers,</i> at a distance from their wives, to trim the lamps in the evening, and to see that none were extinguished, (Menochius) as also to teach music, &c.

(Calmet) --- "Tis difficult to account for the repetition, provided they were repeated originally; but if they have been repeated through the blunder of a transcriber, the existence of the same words" before them may be the reason. (Kennicott) --- <i>The father of Gabaon.</i> This is the explanation of <i>Abigabaon,</i> chap. viii. 29. (Haydock) --- <i>Wife.</i> So the former chapter, and all the ancient versions, with some Hebrew manuscripts, read, instead of the printed Hebrew, "sister," (Kennicott) which seems to be corrupted; (Calmet) and the Protestants venture to correct it.

(Kennicott) --- These remarks, which may appear to some minute, shew that all Hebrew manuscripts are not absolutely alike, as some once pretended; and that the Hebrew Bible is not printed from the best copies. (Haydock) --- "The sacred volume in Hebrew has, therefore, been published with such carelessness, as no other printed copy with which I am acquainted." (Houbigant, prol. p. 2.) --- Yet this is the copy, which alone Protestants hold up as the standard of perfection, and the Rule of Faith! (Haydock)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1CH:11:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>David.</i> This name is written without <i>i,</i> in the books composed before the captivity, (the year before Christ 588) but <i>i</i> is inserted in the latter works, which is an argument against the antiquities of [Canticle of] Canticles, where the <i>i</i> is found. Yet the manuscripts vary so, that great stress is not laid on this (Kennicott) proof, and it is not sufficient weight to stand against the general opinion, which attributes that work to Solomon. (Haydock) --- <i>Hebron,</i> after the death of Isboseth, 2 Kings v. (Calmet) --- <i>Flesh;</i> related, as the children of Jacob.'
      v:003:
        - "1CH:11:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Which he spoke,</i> is not expressed in Hebrew or Septuagint. Samuel complied with the injunction, by anointing David, 1 Kings xvi. 13. He also wrote an account of this memorable transaction, which translated the sceptre from one family to another. (Haydock) --- It is, on this account, that the author here takes particular notice of God's decree. (Kennicott)"
      v:005:
        - "1CH:11:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Here.</i> In 2 Kings v. 6, the passage is much fuller, and attended with many difficulties. Kennicott would correct and translate it: \"And they spake unto David, saying, Thou shalt not come hither: for the blind and the lame shall keep thee off, by saying, David shall not come hither. But David took the stronghold of Sion,\" (different from the citadel. Josephus) \"which is the city of David. And David said, on that day, whosoever (first) smiteth the Jebusites, and, through the subterraneous passage, reacheth the blind and the lame, which are hated of David's soul, because the blind and the lame continued to say, he shall not come into this house---shall be head and captain. So Joab, the son of Zeruiah, went up first, and was head.\""
      v:008:
        - "1CH:11:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Round.</i> He made a complete inclosure or fortification, as <i>Mello</i> denotes perfection, or completion, (Haydock) by building houses from the castle to the town beneath it. David begun at the very house (or citadel, 4 Kings xii. 20.) from which the blind and the lame thought to have excluded him, and built all round, so as to make an entire communication. (Kennicott) --- <i>Built.</i> Protestants, \"repaired.\" Hebrew <i>yechaye,</i> (Haydock) \"saved alive.\" (Syriac, &c.; Poole's Synop.) But probably <i>shear</i> is now written instead of <i>shor,</i> and <em>j</em><em>é</em><em>je</em> ought to be <i>jeje.</i> The long and the short <i>e</i> are easily confounded, (Haydock) and <i>a</i> is frequently thus inserted. (Watson) --- \"He built....round to the beginning of that circuit. And Joab was made governor of the city.\" (Kennicott) --- \"And surrounding it with a wall, he appointed Joab superintendant of the walls.\" (Josephus, [Antiquities?] vii. 3.) --- The position of the vowel points in these words, might naturally cause this mistake, (Haydock) as it seems to have done on other occasions. Thus <i>shor,</i> \"an ox,\" should be <i>sar,</i> \"a prince,\" Genesis xlix. 6., and Osee xii. 11. <i>Shevarim,</i> \"oxen,\" has been read <i>sarim,</i> \"princes,\" by the Septuagint. The former passage might admit of some corrections. \"In their anger they slew the men, and in their fury (<i>vabrothom;</i> instead of <i>vabrotsnom,</i> which is always explained in a good sense) they destroyed the princes. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their fury, for it was inflexible.\""
      v:009:
        - '1CH:11:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Lord.</i> 2 Kings adds <i>God,</i> more properly, as it seems always to have been inserted, though it is now wanting in two hundred places. (Kennicott, Dis. i. p. 62 and 525.)'
      v:010:
        - '1CH:11:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>These.</i> Besides the help which David received immediately from God, he derived great assistance from Joab, the captain-general, from the six more renowned valiant men, and from the body of Thirty, as well as from fifteen others of less note, who are mentioned here. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - '1CH:11:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Number.</i> 2 Kings xxiii. 8., <i>the names.</i> But the two authors do not always use the same terms. (Kennicott) --- <i>Thirty,</i> or <i>three,</i> (2 Kings) more correctly. (Du Hamel) --- <i>Three.</i> 2 Kings, <i>eight;</i> (Haydock) probably by mistake. --- <i>Wounded,</i> or rather soldiers. He encountered singly a whole regiment, though he might not kill them all; much less did he attack them, when already wounded. (Kennicott) -- Numbers have often been expressed by letter in Hebrew, as well as in Greek and other languages. Our numeral figures are not liable to fewer mistakes. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "This is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, (the son of Zabdiel) the Hachmonite, chief of three. He lifted up his spear against three hundred soldiers at one time." (Kennicott)'
      v:012:
        - '1CH:11:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>His.</i> Hebrew, "the son of Dodi."'
      v:013:
        - '1CH:11:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>And.</i> "Who could have discovered that thirty-four words are here omitted, if they had not been preserved in 2 Kings xxiii.," though with some inaccuracy? We should read, "And when the men of Israel were fled, he arose and smote the Philistines, until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword. And the Lord wrought a great deliverance that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil. And after him was Shammah, the son of Agee, the Hararite: And the Philistines were gathered together at Lechi, where was a piece of ground full of barley....<b>14.</b> But he placed himself in the midst of the field, (of barley) and saved it, and smote the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great deliverance." (Kennicott) --- The name of Semma must have been omitted by the transcriber. (Calmet) --- Without it, how will the number 37 be made out?'
      v:014:
        - '1CH:11:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>These men.</i> Septuagint speak only of one: "And he stood," &c., (Haydock) and the verbs are singular, 2 Kings xxiii. 12. --- <i>Gave.</i> Hebrew <i>vayahas</i> (ibid.[2 Kings xxiii. 12.?]) is more correct than <i>vayosha,</i> "saved." (Kennicott) --- Protestants are forced to add, "saved <i>them</i> by a great deliverance." But there is nothing in the original signifying <i>by.</i> (Haydock)'
      v:015:
        - '1CH:11:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Captains.</i> This is not rightly expressed in any of the ancient versions, no more than in the Protestant, which has, ""Three of the Thirty chief;" marginal note, "Three captains over the Thirty." The latter signification comes much nearer to the truth. It should be, "And there went down three captains, (Jesbaam, Eleazar, and Semma. Haydock) who were over Thirty." There were properly seven captains, or "heads of the other Thirty." --- <i>Rock,</i> (<i>hatsur</i>) which seems preferable to <i>katsir,</i> "in the time of harvest," 2 Kings. (Kennicott) (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - '1CH:11:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Garrison,</i> or advanced guard.'
      v:017:
        - '1CH:11:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>O that.</i> Hebrew, "Who will." David wished to see his native country freed from the troops of the Philistines. --- <i>In.</i> Hebrew, "by the gate."'
      v:018:
        - '1CH:11:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>These.</i> Hebrew, "The three (or perhaps, <i>three of the mighty men</i>) brake through the host of the Philistines....by the gate, and took, and brought it to David. But David would not drink it; and he poured it out unto the Lord," by way of prayer, (Kennicott) or of thanksgiving. (Josephus)'
      v:019:
        - '1CH:11:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>In the.</i> Hebrew, "thing! Shall I drink the blood of these men, with their lives? for at the hazard of their lives they have brought it! And he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men," (Kennicott) forming the first ternary. (Tirinus) --- Among these heroes there were different degrees of excellence. (Calmet) --- Protestants acknowledge the superlative, "mightiest:" but "mighty" would do better, as they were not still equal to Joab. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - '1CH:11:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Abisai.</i> His name is written without the middle <i>i,</i> in all this book. --- <i>Three.</i> Alexandrian Septuagint alone reads, "six." --- <i>He was.</i> Hebrew adds, "not;" evidently mistaking <i>lo,</i> "not," for <i>lo,</i> "ei." See 4 Kings viii. 10. "He lifted up his spear against 300 soldiers, and had a name among Three." (Kennicott)'
      v:021:
        - '1CH:11:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Second</i> and (Haydock) <i>first</i> occur not in Hebrew and Septuagint. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "Of the three he was more honourable than two; therefore he was their captain: and yet he attained not unto the first three." (Kennicott) --- <i>First</i> is indeed the sense, but it is not expressed in the original. We have here the exact order of these mighty men sufficiently marked out. Abisai is the first captain (Haydock) of the second ternary. (Tirinus)'
      v:022:
        - '1CH:11:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Two ariels</i>. That is, two lions, or lion-like men; for ariel, in Hebrew, signifies "a lion (Challoner) of God," the strongest compound word for "a man of valour. The courage of a lion is so singular, that a man of extraordinary heroism is frequently called a <i>lion,</i> by way of emphasis; and the word <i>God</i> is frequently applied in Scripture to things particularly great." (Kennicott) --- <i>V</i> is wanting at the beginning and end of the name of Banaias, (here <i>Benaia,</i> instead of <i>Ubenaiahu</i> and Banaias, 2 Kings.) The last letter (ver. 24) serves to distinguish this third captain in waiting on the king, from the eleventh, ver. 31., and chap. xxvii. 5., and 14. (Haydock) -- Hebrew, "And Benaihu, the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, mighty in exploits; he slew two men of Moab, who were stouter than lions. He also went down and slew a lion in a pit, in a snowy day." (Kennicott) --- We have observed, that "And" is not found in the printed Hebrew nor is it in the Protestant, "Benaiah....slew two lion-like men, of Moad." Literally, "ariels;" (Septuagint) that is, "lions of God," or two of Moab <i>equal to</i> (Haydock) the strongest lions. (Worthington) --- Yet it is not certain whether these were not real lions, as well as the following. (Haydock) --- St. Jerome translates, <i>two lions of Moab,</i> 2 Kings xxiii. 20. (Calmet) --- <i>Lion: ari</i> is written <i>arih,</i> 2 Kings. (Haydock)'
      v:023:
        - '1CH:11:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Cubits.</i> 2 Kings, "a man of great aspect." --- <i>Ones.</i> Hebrew, "and he had a name among three mighty men." (Kennicott) --- <i>Shelosha,</i> "three," has the <i>u</i> omitted, (2 Kings) as it is frequently on other occasions. (Haydock)'
      v:025:
        - '1CH:11:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Among,</i> or rather "above," as he was the second captain of this series, and not one of the body of Thirty. (Kennicott) --- <i>Council.</i> Literally, "placed him at his ear," (Haydock) <i>fecit eum auricularium a secreto;</i> (2 Kings) though the word is the same. (Calmet) --- It seems, however, to have been read differently. (Haydock) --- Septuagint, "he placed him over his family, (Calmet, {GREEK:START patrian}πατριαν{GREEK:END}) or native place." (Haydock) --- Syriac, "guard of his spear, and chief of his heroes." Arabic, "over all his riches." Some would translate, "captain of his guards." (Grotius) --- Banaias was a man of consummate prudence, as well as a great warrior. (Calmet) --- David "gives Banaias the command of his life-guard." (Josephus, [Antiquities?] vii. 12.) --- Hebrew, "Behold! he was more honourable than the Thirty; but he attained not unto the first three, and David set him over his guard," the Cerethites, &c., chap. xviii. 17. (Kennicott) --- This author adopts the correction of Grotius, as the Protestants do; though he acknowledges there is no impropriety in the present reading, "over his hearing or obedience." He also adds "first," by way of explanation, as [in] ver. 21. (Haydock)'
      v:026:
        - '1CH:11:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Moreover.</i> Nothing particular is here recorded of Asahel, and therefore he is barely mentioned with the rest. But the Book of Kings had been more particular in determining their rank, and had said, "Asahel, brother of Joab, was over the Thirty," being the last of the second ternary. The preposition <i>b</i> (Kennicott) frequently means, "over." (Nold., &c.) --- Arabic, "head of Thirty, whose names are these." (Kennicott) --- <i>Elchanan;</i> probably the son of Jair, 2 Kings xxi. 18. (Calmet)'
      v:027:
        - "1CH:11:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Arorite,</i> or Harodite, (2 Kings) to distinguish him from Shammah. Eliza, who follows in 2 Kings is here universally omitted, as he is supposed to have died soon, and to have been replaced by Zabad, (ver. 41.) who completes the number of 30. (Kennicott) --- <i>Phalonite;</i> not Paltite, as 2 Kings, where <i>t</i> has been formed of the two letters <i>un.</i> So Septuagint have read Adni, \"my lord,\" perhaps correctly, (Kennicott) instead of Adan, \"any man's,\" (1 Kings xvii. 32.) as the two letters might easily be mistaken for one. (Kennicott) --- Helles was the captain for the seventh month, as the following was for the sixth, and Abiezer for the ninth, chap. xxvii. 10. (Haydock)"
      v:029:
        - '1CH:11:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Sobbochai,</i> rather than Mobonnai, (2 Kings) where <i>s</i> and <i>m</i> have been mistaken for <i>m</i> and <i>n,</i> which are very similar in Hebrew. The Septuagint (Aldi) has there also Sabouchai. He was the eighth captain, chap. xxvii. --- <i>Ilai</i>, or Selmon, 2 Kings. Septuagint have the same variation in some copies; but others lead us to suppose that Ilai was the true name. Neither occur any where else in Scripture.'
      v:030:
        - '1CH:11:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Maharai,</i> the tenth captain, chap. xxvii. Heled was the twelfth.'
      v:031:
        - '1CH:11:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Ethai.</i> Not the famous prince of Geth, (2 Kings xv. 19.; Kennicott) though the name is written alike, (2 Kings xxiii. 29.) an <i>i</i> being omitted. (Haydock) --- This captain contributed to make David king, ver. 10. --- <i>Banaia.</i> 2 Kings xxiii., a <i>v</i> is added, which makes the name like that of the second general; (ver. 22.) but it ought to form part of the <i>e</i>, which is wanting in the following word.'
      v:032:
        - "1CH:11:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Hurai,</i> rather than <i>Heddai,</i> (2 Kings.; Kennicott) though there is some doubt which is to be preferred. (Haydock) --- Syriac and Arabic have Hiddai; but the Septuagint declare for Hurai here, and the Aldine copy has Ouri also, 2 Kings. (Kennicott) --- <i>Torrent.</i> Hebrew, \"of the torrents <i>or vales</i> of Gaas.\" (Calmet) --- <i>Abiel.</i> 2 Kings <i>Abialbon,</i> which seems to be the right word, as a transcriber may omit letters more easily than he can insert them. <i>Bun</i> and the end seems to have been written separate, and to have been translated \"the son of,\" by Syriac and Arabic. The particles <i>al</i> and <i>al,</i> have also been frequently mistaken on account of their nearly similar pronunciation. --- <i>Bauramite.</i> Hebrew <i>habacharumi,</i> 2 Kings <i>habarchumi,</i> where two letters are transposed, and <i>v</i> is omitted, as usual, in the latter book. (Haydock) --- The former reading appears to be more correct, as the hero probably came from Bahurim, (<i>berim,</i> 2 Kings iii. 16.) and the Syriac and Arabic seem to have read properly. --- <i>Salabonite.</i> Septuagint {GREEK:START Salabonites}Σαλαβονιτησ{GREEK:END} (2 Kings) {GREEK:START Salaboni}Σαλαβονι{GREEK:END}. (Kennicott) --- The translator of the latter book gives the Hebrew termination throughout, instead of the Greek; (Haydock) \"whence the learned have drawn an unanswerable argument against that version's being the work of the same author.\" (Kennicott) --- They might as well prove that St. Jerome did not translate both these books. (Haydock)"
      v:033:
        - "1CH:11:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Gezonite.</i> We know not the meaning of this epithet. (Calmet) --- In 2 Kings, we read <i>of the sons of Jassen, Jonathan, and Semma;</i> (K.) but both seem to be incorrect; instead of Septuagint, \"the son,\" or supposing <i>m</i> to be lost, at the beginning, \"of the sons of Assem, Gouni,\" as Septuagint read, instead of <i>Gezonite,</i> which would leave this hero without any name. See chap. v. 15. E is prefixed to this name, as it is to that of Manasses, Josue i. 12. --- <i>Sage,</i> should be Shamha, (Kennicott) or <i>Jonathan, the son of Samaa,</i> the brother of David. He slew the monstrous giant, (chap. xx. 7.) as Sabachai did another. Jonathan is mentioned also along with Asahel (2 Kings xxi.) so that he deserves a place here among David's heroes."
      v:034:
        - '1CH:11:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Sachar,</i> mentioned [in] chap. xxvi. 4.'
      v:035:
        - '1CH:11:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Eliphal</i> should be <i>Eliphelet, the son of Aasbai, the son of Machati,</i> (Haydock) or of the country of Maacha, 4 Kings xxv. 23. (Kennicott) --- <i>Eliphal</i> and <i>Hepher</i> cannot constitute two heroes, as that would derange the number 37, 2 Kings xxiii. 39. The copies of the Septuagint vary much. (Haydock)'
      v:036:
        - "1CH:11:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>Ahia,</i> or rather \"Eliam, the son of Achitophel, the Gilonite,\" 2 Kings. The name of the hero is lost here; and the latter part of his father's name (<i>p</i>) has also been mistaken for <i>g,</i> which it resembles."
      v:037:
        - '1CH:11:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Hesro</i> ends with <i>u</i> in the Hebrew. Yet some read more properly with <i>i,</i> "Hetzrai," as all the ancient versions have it, except the Vulgate, (Kennicott) some copies of which read Asra. (Blanchini, Vind. 1740.) --- <i>Carmelite.</i> Septuagint {GREEK:START Karmedi}Καρμηδι{GREEK:END}. The {GREEK:START D}Δ{GREEK:END} might easily be mistaken for {GREEK:START L}Λ{GREEK:END}, as the Greek bibles (Kennicott) for some ages after Origen were written in capital letters, without accents. (Montfaucon, Pref. to Hexap. p. 44.) --- <i>Azbai</i> seems preferable to <i>Arbi,</i> as the proper name seems also more correct than <i>Pharai,</i> 2 Kings. (Haydock) --- The Vatican Septuagint confounds both words in one "Ouraiverchi." We may apply to many of the proper names that severe censure which St. Jerome has passed upon the transcribers of the book of Chronicles. <i>Ita in Græcis & Latinis cod: hic nominum liber vitiosus est, ut non tam Hebræa quam Barbara quædam & Sarmatica nomina conjecta arbitrandum eit,</i> &c. (ep. ad Domn.) If this epistle be not genuine, the same doctor complains at least of the incorrect state of the Septuagint. (Pref. in Paral.)'
      v:038:
        - '1CH:11:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Joel</i> seems better than Igaal, (2 Kings; Haydock) as we know there were some of this name [who] lived under David, (chap. xxvi. 22., and xxvii. 20.) and all the versions agree here, but vary much [in] 2 Kings. It is, therefore, more natural for us to adhere to that copy which has the greatest authority from the ancient versions. (Kennicott) --- <i>Brother,</i> relation, adopted child, (Du Hamel) or <i>son,</i> (2 Kings) which seems more correct, as this is an usual expression. (Calmet) --- This reason may rather lead us to conclude that the mistake being more natural, has been made by the transcriber of that book; particularly as we no where else read of Joel being the son of Nathan, but rather of Pedaiah, &c. --- <i>Mibahar,</i> or rather "Nathan of Tzoba." --- <i>The son,</i> ought to be the proper name, "Bonni, (of Gadi, 2 Kings) or the Gadite." (Kennicott)'
      v:041:
        - '1CH:11:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Zabad.</i> This name, with the following, is not found [in] 2 Kings, where Elica occurs, though not mentioned here. (Calmet) --- We have observed that Zabad took his place, and completed the number 37, ver. 27.'
      v:042:
        - '1CH:11:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>With him.</i> Hebrew, "above him," (Septuagint, Junius, Montanus) which must be applied to the rest of these 15 less valiant men. (Kennicott) --- Protestants agree with the Vulgate (Haydock) and Delany looks upon these 30 as a forth order of commanders in chief. But 30 with him would make 31, and why are only 15 mentioned? We have a regular gradation of officers, descending from Joab, the captain general. (Kennicott) --- These heroes are supplementary to those in the Book of Kings, and were stationed (Calmet) on the east of the Jordan, (Du Hamel) in their native country; (Calmet) which is true, at least (Haydock) with respect to several of them. Maacha, Ashtaroth, and Aroer were in these parts, (Josue xiii. 9, 13.; Kennicott) as well as Mathana, Numbers xxi. 18. (Calmet)'
      v:044:
        - '1CH:11:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>Jehiel.</i> The Masorets read so in the margin; but in the text they substitute <i>u</i> for <i>i,</i> improperly. See Septuagint and chap. v. 7, 8.'
      v:045:
        - '1CH:11:45 | 45 | 45 | <i>Samri.</i> Protestants, "Shimri," or, margin, "the Shimrite," as they deem the expression to be equivalent. But Shimri was rather the father of Jedihel or Jediael, and Joha.'
      v:046:
        - '1CH:11:46 | 46 | 46 | <i>Mahumite.</i> Protestants, "Mahavite." Kennicott would translate these last verses according to his corrections. (<strong>42</strong>) ..."Zabad, the son of Ahlai; (<b>43</b>) Adina, the son of Shiza, the Reubenite, and head of the Reubenites: But the thirty were his superiors. (<strong>44</strong>) Hanan, the son of Maacah; and Josaphat, the Mithnite. (<strong>45</strong>) Urzia, the Ashtarothite; Shema and Jehiel, the sons of Hotham, the Aroerite. (<strong>46</strong>) Jediel, the son of Shimri; and Joha, his brother, the Titzite. (<strong>47</strong>) Jeliel and Mahavite, and Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam; and Ithmah, the Moabite; (<b>48</b>) Eliel, and Obed and Jashiel, the Metzobaites." It will be easily perceived that this author frequently recedes from the Protestant version, as well as from the printed Hebrew, both of which are frequently erroneous. Perhaps the critical examination of these proper names, may appear to some unimportant. But the question respecting the perfect integrity of the Hebrew text deserves to be seriously considered; and every part of sacred history requires our attention. If the Protestant rule of faith be incorrect, what security can they have? We are not exposed to the same inconvenience, even though the Vulgate be susceptible of farther improvement. (Haydock)'

      v:002:
        - '1CH:12:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Hand,</i> like Aod, Judges iii. 15. (Menochius) --- <i>Brethren,</i> of the same tribe. The opinion which they entertained of David, must have been very great, to make them expose themselves to such dangers. In adversity, true friendship and virtue shine the most. (Calmet) --- The hand of providence is here conspicuous. (Tirinus)'
      v:004:
        - '1CH:12:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Thirty.</i> Hebrew <i>sheloshim,</i> denotes "the officers" of the army. (Calmet) --- Protestants style this hero "Ismaiah."'

      v:015:
        - '1CH:12:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Month,</i> Nisan. (Tirinus) --- <i>Banks.</i> This circumstance enhances their courage. Maundrel (Alep. p. 136) went to see the Jordan, 13th March, 1697, but the river was nine feet from the banks. Its rapidity has perhaps made its bed so much deeper, that it does not overflow so frequently at present. (Calmet)'

      v:019:
        - '1CH:12:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Fight.</i> They joined him after he had left the Philistines. (Calmet) --- <i>But he.</i> Hebrew, "they helped them not." Neither David nor his partizans were involved in this danger, which might have caused their fidelity to be suspected, 1 Kings xxix. (Haydock)'

      v:014: 1CH:21:14 | 14 | 14 | So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel. And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
      v:015: '1CH:21:15 | 15 | 15 | And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to strike it: and as he was striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for the greatness of the evil: and said to the angel that destroyed: It is enough; now stop thy hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan, the Jebusite.'
      v:016: '1CH:21:16 | 16 | 16 | And David, lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against Jerusalem: and both he, and the ancients, clothed in hair-cloth, fell down flat on the ground.'
      v:017: "1CH:21:17 | 17 | 17 | And David said to God: Am not I he that commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned: it is I that have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O Lord, my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father's house: and let not thy people be destroyed."
      v:018: '1CH:21:18 | 18 | 18 | And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David, to go up, and build an altar to the Lord God, in the threshing-floor of Ornan, the Jebusite.'
      v:019: '1CH:21:19 | 19 | 19 | And David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord.'
      v:020: '1CH:21:20 | 20 | 20 | Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the angel, he and his four sons hid themselves: for at that time he was threshing wheat in the floor.'
      v:021: '1CH:21:21 | 21 | 21 | And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and went out of the threshing-floor to meet him, and bowed down to him, with his face to the ground.'
      v:022: '1CH:21:22 | 22 | 22 | And David said to him: Give me this place of thy threshing-floor, that I may build therein an altar to the Lord: but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people.'
      v:023: '1CH:21:23 | 23 | 23 | And Ornan said to David: Take it, and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover, the oxen also I give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the sacrifice: I will give it all willingly.'
      v:024: '1CH:21:24 | 24 | 24 | And king David said to him: It shall not be so: but I will give thee money as much as it is worth: for I must not take it from thee, and so offer to the Lord holocausts free-cost.'
      v:025: '1CH:21:25 | 25 | 25 | So David gave to Ornan for the place, six hundred sicles of gold of just weight.'
      v:026: '1CH:21:26 | 26 | 26 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And he built there an altar to the Lord: and he offered holocausts, and peace-offerings, and he called upon the Lord, and he heard him, by sending fire from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust.'

      v:028: '1CH:21:28 | 28 | 28 | And David seeing that the Lord had heard him, in the threshing-floor of Ornan, the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims there.'
      v:029: '1CH:21:29 | 29 | 29 | But the tabernacle of the Lord, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of holocausts, was at that time in the high place of Gabaon.'
      v:030: '1CH:21:30 | 30 | 30 | And David could not go to the altar, there to pray to God: for he was seized with an exceedingly great fear, seeing the sword of the angel of the Lord.'

        - '1CH:22:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Proselytes.</i> This is the first time that the word occurs in the Vulgate. See Exodus xii. 45. It means "strangers," (Calmet) who were not allowed to live in the country, unless they would observe the natural law, and renounce idolatry. (Rabbins) --- These had embraced the Jewish religion. (Menochius) --- They were the remnants of the people of Chanaan, (3 Kings ix. 20,) and were treated as public slaves, which could not have been done, with justice or policy, with regard to those who might barely wish to reside in the country. These strangers prefigured the Gentiles, chosen to build the Christian Church.'

(Tirinus) --- David began his preparations long before. --- <i>Lord.</i> Hebrew, "<i>must be</i> (Haydock) for grandeur, excellence, fame, and beauty, through all countries" a sort of prodigy. --- <i>All.</i> Hebrew, "abundantly."'
      v:008:
        - "1CH:22:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Blood,</i> of Urias, (St. Jerome and the Rabbins) or rather, as David had already entertained the desire of building a temple before that event, (Estius) the blood which David had shed in just wars, must be understood; as even that causes a person to be regarded as unclean. The soldiers were obliged to be purified before they could enter the camp, Numbers xxxi. 19. In the Christian Church, those are deemed irregular who have contributed to the death of the guilty, even as judges or witnesses. The Pagans entertained the like sentiments. (Calmet) Æneas dares not touch the sacred vessels and household gods, when he was stained with blood, shed in his country's defence.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Tu, genitor, cape sacra manu, patriosque penates</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Me bello e tanto digressum et cæde recenti</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Attrectare nefas.</i> (Virgil, Æneid ii.){JOIN}--- <i>So.</i> Hebrew, \"much blood in my sight.\" (Haydock) --- This expression enhances (Du Hamel) the greatness of the bloodshed; as when a person is said to be wicked, &c., before the Lord, it means in an extraordinary degree. The wars of David are frequently assigned as the impediment to David's building the temple, chap. xvii. 4., and xxviii. 3. (Josephus, &c.) (Calmet) --- They would not suffer him to have sufficient leisure, ver. 18., (Haydock) 3 Kings v. 3. (Salien) (Menochius)"
      v:009:
        - '1CH:22:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Peaceable.</i> Hebrew, "Solomon," which has this meaning. (Calmet) --- Herein Solomon was a figure of Christ, who is styled the Prince of peace, Isaias ix. (Worthington)'
      v:010:
        - '1CH:22:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Name.</i> See 2 Kings vii. 13. (Menochius) --- <i>A son.</i> The crimes into which Solomon fell, hinder us from explaining this literally of him. St. Paul refers the expression to Jesus Christ, Hebrews i. 5. (Calmet) --- St. Augustine (de C.[City of God?] xvii. 8 and 9.) observes that the promises were not perfectly fulfilled in Solomon.'
      v:012:
        - '1CH:22:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Understanding,</i> (<i>sensum.</i>) Skill to resolve difficult questions. (Menochius) --- <i>That.</i> Hebrew, "and appoint thee to rule." (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - "1CH:22:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Poverty.</i> Protestants, \"trouble.\" (Haydock) --- David confesses that the immense sums which he had collected, were nothing in comparison with the greatness of God. He left more than was sufficient for Solomon to perfect the work, with still greater magnificence than he had planned out, ver. 5., chap. xxviii. 2., and xxix. 2., &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Million.</i> Josephus ([Antiquities?] vii. 14.) reduces these sums to one tenth part, \"of gold 10,000 talents, of silver 100,000;\" so that it is \"extremely probable that a <i>cipher</i>\" was added to these numbers, in some very ancient Hebrew copy. Brerewood computes that the sum mentioned here and [in] chap xxix. 4, would amount to 841,125,000<i>l.</i> and maintains that the whole temple pavement, and all the vessels, might have been made of solid gold, without consuming it all. (De pond, in Walton's Polyglot.) --- \"If we take the preceding talents according to bishop Cumberland's computation, the sum total will be somewhat less: but, were we to reduce it to less than one-half, would not the sum of four hundred millions of money be immense and incredible?\" (Kennicott) --- A learned Jew has written this marginal note in his Bible, 1661: \"It is supposed, these talents are not to be reckoned like the Mosaic, for they would amount to 720 millions. But as the Scripture makes no difference, we have no other computation to go by.\" See Kennicott, diss. ii. If they were the same, the sum would exceed belief. Some have thought that they were only half. Mariana supposes the talents were only the weight of sicles, or four drachms; so that David left one million for the fabric. (Du Hamel) --- But the relation given by historians of the riches of Sardanapalus, Cyrus, Alexander, Atabalipa, and some kings, who were not more likely to amass such treasures than David, make the account less improbable. Josephus ([Antiquities?] vii. 12.) asserts, that \"no prince ever left so great riches.\" He had extended his dominions on all sides, and imposed tribute on the conquered. He was very frugal, and had possession of the mines of Phunon, (Numbers xxi. 10., and xxxiii. 43.) and of Phœnicia, Deuteronomy xxxiii. 25. Though the talent seems to have varied in other nations, it always consisted of 3000 sicles among the Hebrews, at least till the captivity, Exodus xxxviii. 25, 26. We find from 2 Paralipomenon xxv. 6., and 4 Kings xv. 19., &c., that it formed a very considerable sum. Yet Villalpand calculates that all the gold and silver left by David, would be requisite for the ornaments and vessels of the temple. If, however, we grant that it would have sufficed to build a massive temple of gold, how much must be deducted to pay the workmen? &c. (Calmet, Diss. on the riches left by David, t. ii.) --- <i>For all.</i> Hebrew, Chaldean, Septuagint, \"And to these add.\" (Tirinus) --- He encouraged the princes to contribute; (chap. xxxix.) and here he exhorts his son to shew his liberality, if any thing should be found deficient. (Haydock)"

        - '1CH:24:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Before.</i> Hebrew, "in the presence of." See Leviticus x. 2. --- <i>Priesthood,</i> under Aaron. Eleazar succeeded him, and the posterity of Ithamar obtained the dignity under Heli.'
      v:003:
        - '1CH:24:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Ahimelech</i> is styled also Achimelech and Abiathar, ver. 6, 21., and chap. xviii. 16. (Calmet) --- <i>Courses,</i> twenty-four, which were to serve by lot, that no one might complain, as they were equally <i>princes,</i> ver. 5. Hence St. Dionisius styles Zachary "prince of the priests." But the pontiff was over all. (Tirinus)'
      v:004:
        - 1CH:24:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Houses.</i> The descendants of Eleazar were far more numerous.
      v:005:
        - '1CH:24:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Of God,</i> great. <i>Elohim</i> also signifies "judges," and we might translate, "princes of the judges." (Grotius) (Du Hamel) --- These men occupied the first dignities of the priesthood, and of the judicature, or they were princes in all sacred affairs. (Calmet) --- They were to offer sacrifice, and to enjoy spiritual jurisdiction, in the house of God. (Worthington) --- As their claims were therefore equal, the decision was left to lots. (Menochius) --- It would have been otherwise difficult for all to be satisfied. See Josue vii. 14. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - '1CH:24:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Ithamar.</i> All was done with the utmost order, and the priests took care to observe the regulation, till the end of the republic. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] vii. 2., and contra Apion i., and ii., and Luke i. 5.) --- The family of Eleazar had many prerogatives over the rest, as it was longer in possession of the high priesthood, and more numerous; but that of Ithamar, gave pontiffs to the nation at the time of this regulation. The Hebrew is very obscure, and is deemed incorrect. (Cap.) (Grotius) (Calmet) --- Protestants, "one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and <i>one</i> taken for Ithamar." --- The insertion of "one," which is in the Septuagint, removes the difficulty. (Haydock) --- The two families were enregistered alternately, (Menochius) till the eight families of Ithamar were done. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - '1CH:24:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Abia,</i> the progenitor of St. John the Baptist, Luke i. 5. Yet whether his father was "chief of the priests" of his course, as St. Dionisius asserts, or whether he sprung from Eleazar, or from Ithamar, is uncertain. (Tirinus)'
      v:019:
        - '1CH:24:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Aaron,</i> and his successors. The former might have given some directions, which tradition had preserved. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - '1CH:24:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Subael,</i> grandson of Moses, chap. xxiii. 16.'
      v:021:
        - '1CH:24:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Rohobia</i> was in the same degree, by Eliezer. (Menochius)'
      v:023:
        - '1CH:24:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>And his.</i> Protestants, "the sons <i>of Hebron,</i> Jeriah, <i>the first.</i>" The words underlined, shew what omissions are in the text, (Haydock) which is probably corrupted, as well as the Septuagint. Jeria and Amarias were sons of Hebron, chap. xxiii. 19., and xxvi. 31. <i>Jahath</i> may, therefore, be the same with Hebron. (Calmet)'
      v:026:
        - '1CH:24:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>The son.</i> Hebrew, "the son of Jehasia, <i>or</i> of Oziau...." But the name of this son is lost. It is wonderful that the posterity of Gersom are passed over. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "the sons of Jaaziah; Beno. --- <b>27.</b> The sons of Merari, by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoam." (Haydock) --- Septuagint vary, and the original text is supposed to be changed by some transcriber, (Capel. &c.) as we read only of Moholi and Musi, ver. 26., and chap. xxiii. 21.'
      v:031:
        - '1CH:24:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Over-against,</i> in imitation of the priests, (Calmet) being likewise divided into twenty-four classes. (Tirinus) --- <i>Both,</i> &c. Hebrew, "the principal fathers over-against their younger brethren." All the rest is omitted. Lots decided the place and functions both of father and children. (Haydock)'

        - '1CH:26:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Porters,</i> who guarded the temple, being stationed at the four gates. They were selected from the families of Core and Merari, (ver. 19.) and were under (Calmet) five captains, two being placed at the gate leading from the palace, ver. 16. (Haydock) --- How many were appointed to follow the directions of these officers, we do not find. But 4,000 porters are mentioned, chap. xxiii. 5. Some guarded the treasury, &c. After the captivity, the same plan was adopted, chap. ix. (Calmet) --- <i>Son,</i> or descendant of Core, by Asaph, (Haydock) or Abiasaph, (chap. vi. 37.) different from the musician. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - '1CH:26:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Him.</i> Obededom, by giving him a more numerous posterity, than any here mentioned, ver. 8. See 2 Kings vi. 11. (Calmet) (Tirinus)'
      v:006:
        - '1CH:26:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Semei,</i> who is called Semeias, ver. 4., and 7. The last syllable is not lost in Hebrew or Septuagint. (Haydock) --- <i>Valour.</i> Their post was of a military nature, and required strength. Josephus says, some of the gates could hardly be shut by twenty men.'
      v:010:
        - '1CH:26:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>He had not a first-born.</i> That is, his first-born was either dead or not fit to be chief, and therefore he made Semri the chief, (Worthington; Challoner) who was the second son (Tirinus) of Hosa. Hebrew, "for, <i>or</i> though he was not the first-born, yet his father made him chief." Septuagint add, "of the second division," but without reason, as they interpret, "keeping the command," instead of <i>Semri, the chief,</i> which leaves us without a proper name. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - '1CH:26:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Lord.</i> The companies succeeded each other every sabbath, but the chiefs were not changed. (Calmet) --- The office of these men was most noble. From them were selected treasurers, overseers, prefects, &c., ver. 16-32. (Tirinus) --- The lot decided only between the heads of families. (Du Hamel)'
      v:014:
        - '1CH:26:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Selemias:</i> the first syllable is frequently neglected in Hebrew, chap. iv. 24. (Tirinus) --- <i>Zacharias</i> was the first-born of <i>Meselemia,</i> ver. 2. (Haydock) --- <i>A very.</i> Hebrew, "a wise counsellor." (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - '1CH:26:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>And.</i> Protestants, "To Obededom southward, and to his sons, the house of Asuppim." (Haydock) --- This term may denote the "revenue;" where the offerings, destined for the support of the priests, were collected, Exodus xxxiv. 22. We find the same word used for the offerings received at the door of the temple, 2 Esdras xii. 15. It may also mean the house "of the assemblies," (Calmet) where the 72 judges of the Sanhedrim met. (Villalpand) (Tirinus)'
      v:016:
        - '1CH:26:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Which.</i> Hebrew <i>Shalecheth,</i> (Calmet) or <i>ssolcoth,</i> (Haydock) "which leads <i>or</i> casts out" the filth from the temple. (Villalpand) (Isaias vi. 13.) (Menochius) --- But there were conduits for that purpose; and the meaning of the Vulgate is more accurate. (Calmet) --- The palace lay below the tabernacle and the temple, (Tirinus) on the west. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xv. 14.) (Calmet) --- <i>Ward.</i> The centinels where opposite to each other, (Menochius) or at equal distances. All were replaced at the same time. (Calmet) --- Two captains were stationed on this road, for greater respect to the king, (Haydock) and because the concourse and dangers were increased, ver. 18. (Tirinus)'
      v:017:
        - '1CH:26:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Six.</i> This gate was the most frequented, (Calmet) and the king entered by it. --- <i>Council.</i> Hebrew <i>asupim,</i> as [in] ver. 15, "for the offerings two <i>and</i> two," (Haydock) distinct from the porters.'
      v:018:
        - "1CH:26:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Cell.</i> Hebrew is not clearer: \"at the chamber\" (Calmet; 'at the house of the instruments' for sacrifice; (Menochius) at Parbar.; Protestants) of the west, at the ascent, two at each chamber.\" (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"at the causey, and two at Parbar.\" This term is not in Hebrew. It resembles Parvar, or Pharurim, (4 Kings xxiii. 11.) which is said to signify \"suburbs,\" in Chaldean. But it cannot have this meaning here: and these terms are probably borrowed from the Greek, {GREEK:START phroura}φρουρα{GREEK:END}, a military \"post;\" so that we might translate \"There were at the western post, four guards for the ascent, two at each post:\" one perhaps was near the temple, (Calmet) the other at the palace gates, 4 Kings xi. 6. Septuagint is more diffuse, but throws no light upon this passage. (Haydock)"

      v:021:
        - '1CH:26:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Ledan</i> is called Leedan, (chap. xxiii. 8.) son of Gerson. His first-born was Jahiel. This person is here styled Jehieli, and was chief of the Gersonites; at least the eldest branch.'
      v:022:
        - "1CH:26:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Brethren.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, \"brother.\" In effect, we find that Joel was the son of Leedan, chap. xxiii. --- <i>Zathan,</i> whose name ends in <i>m</i> both in Hebrew and Septuagint, may perhaps be his grandson. We often find <i>sons</i> in Hebrew when only one is specified. Jehieli might adopt his two brothers; so that none of his own children are mentioned. (Haydock) --- We may also translate: \"(<b>21</b>) These are the sons of Ledan, the Gersonite. Out of Ledan, the Gersonite, came chiefs of families: Jehiel, (<b>22</b>) the sons of Jehiel, Zathan and Joel, his (Jehiel's) brethren, <i>were</i> over,\" &c. It appears that Jehiel was treasurer, chap. xxix. 8."

        - 1CH:26:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Moses.</i> Many are passed over; (Calmet) or Subael acted by his children. (Menochius)
      v:026:
        - '1CH:26:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Selemith</i> was to guard the treasure, taken in war. (Calmet) --- <i>Dedicated.</i> Literally, "sanctified," by designating for holy uses. (Worthington)'
      v:027:
        - '1CH:26:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Wars.</i> Hebrew, "out of the spoils won in battles, which they had set apart as sacred, to support the house," &c. Septuagint, "that the building of the house of the Lord might not be retarded." (Haydock) --- Yet these spoils remained untouched by Solomon, who imitated this piety, as others did, 3 Kings xiv. 26. The Romans adored Jupiter <i>Prædator,</i> as he was styled, because part of the plunder was allotted to him. (Servius in Virgil, Æneid iii.){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Irruimus ferro et Divos ipsumque vocamus</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>In prædam partemque Jovem.</i>{JOIN}People vied with each other in the munificence of their presents.

      v:028:
        - '1CH:26:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Samuel,</i> while he was at the head of affairs. (Menochius) --- <i>Joab.</i> Though these three were not very religious, they concurred in promoting the splendour of the public worship, as that would at least procure them applause. (Haydock)'
      v:029:
        - '1CH:26:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Them.</i> Hebrew, "for officers (<i>shoterim,</i> "scribes," (Haydock) whose power was very great.; Calmet) and judges." The former are often placed first, as more honourable, so that they were not mere heralds or executioners. The administration of justice was chiefly in the hands of the Levitical tribe, chap. xxiii. 4. The sons of Hebron resided on the east, while those of Isaar and Oziel probably acted as judges on the western side of the Jordan, ver. 30. (Calmet) --- They were not confined to the temple, but taught the people the law of Moses in the cities <i>abroad.</i> (Menochius)'
      v:030:
        - "1CH:26:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Beyond.</i> Hebrew <i>meheber</i> means, \"at the passage, <i>or</i> on either side.\" Protestants, \"on this side Jordan, westward.\" This would seem to designate the countries nearer Jerusalem. (Haydock) --- But <i>westward</i> may also be understood with reference to Ruben, &c., so as to mean the parts along the river. --- <i>King.</i> To decide both ecclesiastical and civil causes. (Calmet) --- They also inspected the preparations for the temple, and gathered the king's tribute. (Grotius)"

        - "1CH:27:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Now.</i> This list is entirely of a political nature. It seems to have been made before David had obtained the throne of Israel, (ver. 7.) though perhaps the monthly division did not comprise 24,000, before that time. This regulation was very excellent, and enabled the king to have an army of 300,000 men, at a short notice. It was not attended with any material inconvenience to the people, as none were on service above a month. --- <i>Hands.</i> Commanders in chief. --- <i>Captains.</i> Twenty-four in number, with 240 centurions under them. --- <i>Officers.</i> Hebrew <i>shoterim.</i> Septuagint, \"scribes,\" whose employment is not well ascertained. They perhaps acted as commissaries, or kept an account of the king's troops, and reviewed them.

One division comprised 24,000 men."

(Calmet) --- <i>Treasures.</i> Literally, \"cellars.\" (Haydock) --- The original term, <i>Ganzac,</i> is not Hebrew.

(Haydock) --- The change of <i>i</i> for <i>u</i> was very easy; and perhaps the basins were ornamented with representations of lions. (Du Hamel) (Menochius) --- We do not find <i>cephor</i> used before, to denote any of the vessels of the tabernacle: but Esdras uses it, (chap. viii. 27.) whence it is inferred that it is of Chaldean extraction.'

        - '1CH:29:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Tender,</i> not so much in years, for he was 22, but in comparison with David, and with reference to so great a work. (Menochius)'
      v:002:
        - '1CH:29:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Onyx,</i> or "emeralds." (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "<i>soom,</i>" form the Hebrew <i>shoham.</i> --- <i>Alabaster.</i> Hebrew <i>puc.</i> (Haydock) --- The dark paint used for the eyes, has the same name, 4 Kings ix. 30., and Jeremias iv. 30. Yet the stibium or stimmi, or alabaster, mentioned by Pliny, ([Natural History?] xxxiii. 6.) was of a sliver colour, but not transparent. The stone here specified was probably alabaster, as it was used for the pavement. There is a very fine species at Damascus, and in Arabia, which was much sought after to decorate buildings. (Calmet) --- Chaldean has "emeralds." Septuagint, "stones of perfection, rich and various, and every precious stone, and much Parion." (Haydock) --- But [in] Isaias liv. 11, they translate the same term, "carbuncle." (Calmet) --- The stone might resemble the agate, which is beautifully shaded with clouds and other fanciful figures. (Tirinus) --- <i>Paros:</i> this is taken from the Septuagint. Hebrew has simply, "and stones of ssiss." (Haydock) --- Whether it denote the isle of Chio, or that of Chitis, in the Red Sea, the former famous for marble, and the latter for the topaz; or it may refer to Sais, a city of Egypt, which had most beautiful porphyry. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxvi. 7., and xxxvii. 8.) --- But Paros, one of the Cyclades, was most renowned for its white marble. (Pliny xxxvi. 5.) --- Josephus (Jewish Wars vi. 6.) informs us, that the temple was built of large white marble stones; so that it appeared, at a distance, to be covered with snow. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - '1CH:29:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Own.</i> What he had already vowed, he esteemed no longer his. (Worthington) --- <i>Temple.</i> Hebrew, "houses," including the various apartments belonging to the temple. The sum which David had formerly set apart out of the spoils of war, &c., amounted to 825,000,000<i>l.</i> What he now adds, is 16,125,000<i>l.</i> sterling, according to Brerewood, who deems the sums exorbitant; and others have suspected that there is a mistake in the former numbers. We have seen with what foundation, chap. xxii. 14. David was so convinced, that the sum which he had been able to collect was too small, that he exhorted the princes to contribute, with all their power, and set them this noble example, which they endeavoured to imitate. (Haydock) --- He had collected some of the gold of <i>Ophir,</i> which was esteemed the best. (Calmet) See 3 Kings ix. 28. (Menochius) --- We have before remarked, that Solomon went beyond the expectations of his father, and used no <i>silver.</i>'
      v:005:
        - '1CH:29:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Fill his hand,</i> is an expression applied to priests, by which David intimates, that any one may now offer a species of sacrifice to the Lord, Judges vii. 5., and Exodus xxxii. 29. (Calmet) (Menochius) --- He wishes them to act with generosity. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - '1CH:29:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Possessions,</i> mentioned [in] chap. xxvii. 25.'
      v:007:
        - "1CH:29:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Solids.</i> Septuagint, \"pieces of gold;\" {GREEK:START chrusous}χρυσουσ{GREEK:END}. Hebrew <i>adarcnim,</i> which Protestants render \"drachms,\" (Haydock) after the Syriac, &c. Others think that the Darics, used in Persia, are meant, though they did not exist in David's time. Esdras might reduce the money to correspond with the coin with which his countrymen were then acquainted, 2 Esdras vii. 70. (Pelletier) --- The Daric was equivalent to the golden sicle, which was only half the weight of one of silver, though this is not certain. (Calmet) --- A solid was only the sixth part of an ounce, whereas the sicle weighed half an ounce, or four drachms. --- <i>Talents</i> were always of the same weight, 125 Roman pounds. (Menochius)"
      v:008:
        - '1CH:29:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Gersonite;</i> who, with his brethren, was treasurer, chap. xxvi. 22.'
      v:009:
        - '1CH:29:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Willingly.</i> Their disposition was perfect: for God loves a cheerful giver, 2 Corinthians ix. 7. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - '1CH:29:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>From.</i> Septuagint, "from age to age;" (Pagnin, &c.) that is, throughout eternity: (Menochius) "for ever and ever." (Protestants) Eternity has no parts. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 1CH:29:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Magnificence.</i> Thee we ought to magnify. David uses many words to express the sentiments of his grateful soul. (Menochius)
      v:012:
        - '1CH:29:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Thine.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "of thee." (Haydock) --- <i>Greatness.</i> Hebrew, "to magnify and strengthen all." (Menochius) --- Our riches are thy gifts; and to thee we return a part, with gladness.'
      v:014:
        - '1CH:29:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Promise.</i> Hebrew, "to offer so willingly in this manner?" (Haydock) --- He is astonished at the rich display of gifts: but acknowledged that all was originally sent by God. In the same sentiments, we say in the mass, "We offer unto thee of thy own presents and gifts;" or, as the Greek expresses it, {GREEK:START ta sa apo ton son}τα σα απο τον σον{GREEK:END}. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - '1CH:29:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Strangers.</i> We have nothing but what we have received from thee; and for how short a time! (Calmet) --- <i>No stay.</i> Hebrew, "none abiding, (Haydock; <i>or</i>) no hope" of being able to escape death, (Calmet) when we must leave all. How happy, therefore, are those who sent their treasures before them! (Haydock) --- All are pilgrims, with respect to heaven, Hebrews xiii. (Worthington)'
      v:017:
        - '1CH:29:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Simplicity.</i> Hebrew, "uprightness." Septuagint, "justice;" (Haydock) a pure intention, which our Saviour styled <i>a single eye,</i> Matthew vi. 22. (Tirinus)'
      v:018:
        - '1CH:29:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>This.</i> Hebrew, "keep this for ever, in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and direct their heart unto thee. Preserve these good dispositions, which thou hast given them." (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - '1CH:29:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Then</i> is not in Hebrew or Septuagint. (Haydock) --- The same term is used, to express the outward adoration which they shewed to God, and the civil respect which was due to the king: <i>pari gestu,</i> says Grotius, <i>animo diverso.</i> (Calmet) --- How then will Protestants prove that we are guilty of idolatry, when we bow down before the cross, &c., unless they pretend to know the secrets of hearts? Protestants, they "bowed down their heads, (Septuagint, knees) and worshipped the Lord and the king." (Haydock) --- The exterior set was the same, but the intention determined the application. See Exodus xx. (Worthington)'
      v:021:
        - '1CH:29:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>And with.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "and their sacrifices <i>of wine</i> and victims, (or peace-offerings, to be eaten by the people.; Calmet) in abundance for all Israel." (Haydock)'
      v:022:
        - "1CH:29:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>The Lord,</i> at Jerusalem, (Menochius) where the ark was then kept. (Haydock) --- <i>Second time:</i> the first had been done with too much precipitation, in consequence of the attempt of Adonias; (3 Kings i. 39.; Tirinus) or this took place after the death of David, that his successor might be invested with full power, (Grotius) and be acknowledged by all. (Haydock) --- <i>Priest.</i> This at least only took place after the death of David, when Abiathar fell into disgrace, 3 Kings ii. 35. Both prince and priest must act by God's authority; and those who resist them, resist God himself, Romans xiii. 1. (Calmet) --- They are ministers of the <i>Lord.</i> (Haydock)"
      v:024:
        - "1CH:29:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Gave.</i> Hebrew, \"placed their hands upon Solomon.\" Septuagint, \"were subject to him.\" (Calmet) --- The latter words in the Vulgate explain the meaning of the ceremony. (Menochius) --- It seems to have been similar to that used when Abraham required an oath of his servant, Genesis xxiv. 2. Vassals placed their hands within those of their Lord, under whom they hold lands; (Calmet) and the descendants of the Germans testify their submission, by putting their hands between a person's knees. --- The nobles took the oath of fidelity to Solomon, by some such method. (Calmet)"
      v:029:
        - '1CH:29:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Gad, the seer</i> "of David," as he is sometimes styled. These three were well acquainted with David, (Calmet) and wrote the two first books of Kings; (Haydock) or at least those books are compiled from their memorials, (Calmet) if their works be lost, (Menochius) which is uncertain. (Worthington)'
      v:030:
        - '1CH:29:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Under him</i> in various tribulations, towards the end of his reign. (Vatable, &c.) --- Those prophets recorded not only what regarded David, (Haydock) but also what happened of consequence, in other nations, with which he had any connections. --- <i>Of the.</i> Syriac and Arabic, "of his land, <i>or</i> among the kings of his race." (Calmet) --- David reduced under his dominion not only the nations which dwelt in Chanaan, but all those which had been promised <i>to Israel.</i> (Haydock)'

      v:006: "1CH:29:6 | 6 | 6 | Then the heads of the families, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and the overseers of the king's possessions, promised."

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - 'These Books are called by the Greek Interpreters, <b>Paralipomenon;</b> ({GREEK:START Paraleipomenon}Παραληιπωηνον{GREEK:END},) that is, <i>of things left out,</i> or <i>omitted;</i> because they are a kind of supplement of such things as were passed over in the Books of Kings. The Hebrews call them, <i>DibréHajamim;</i> that is, <i>The words of the days,</i> or <i>The Chronicles.</i> Not that they are the books which are so often quoted in <i>the Kings,</i> under the title of, <i>The Words of the days of the kings of Israel,</i> and <i>of the kings of Juda;</i> for the Books of Paralipomenon were written after the Books of Kings; but because, in all probability, they have been abridged from those <i>ancient words of the days,</i> by Esdras, or some other sacred author. (Challoner) --- The author of this compilation refers to the same works, 2 Paralipomenon xvi. 11., &c. These journals were principally composed by prophets, though there were other people appointed to write the most important occurrences, 2 Kings viii. 16., and 4 Kings xviii. 18. The genealogies of families, particularly of the Levites, and the interests of piety and religion, are kept most in view. (Calmet) --- The variations which appear between this work and the other parts of Scripture, are owing to the faults of transcribers; and, though they could not be satisfactorily explained, it would be rashness to condemn the author of inaccuracy, at this distance of time, when we know so little of those transactions. (Haydock) --- Who calls in question the history of Alexander, though the different authors of it scarcely agree in one calculation of the number of troops, nations conquered, &c.?" Yet the work before us is of far higher authority, as it was dictated by the Holy Ghost. (Calmet) --- "Without it, a person would in vain pretend to understand the Scriptures." It is "an epitome of the Old Testament," and "explains many difficulties of the gospels." (St. Jerome) --- The author does not, however, seem to have designed to draw up an exact epitome, or to supply the deficiencies of the other works. (Calmet) --- The first nine chapters contain various genealogical histories. In the 10th, we have the election and death of Saul; and in the remainder of the first book, the transactions of David, (Worthington) till the year [of the world] 2990, where the second book commences with the reign of Solomon, and brings us to the end of the captivity. (The year of the world 3468.; Calmet)'
