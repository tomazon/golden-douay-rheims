    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'MAL:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Malachias,</i> "the angel of the Lord." St. Jerome always reads <i>Malachi,</i> "my angel." Septuagint, "his angel;" whence Origen infers, that this was an angel incarnate. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - "MAL:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Loved us.</i> So they thought, (Theodoret) and perhaps spoke. (Haydock) --- <i>Jacob.</i> I have preferred his posterity, to make them my chosen people, and to load them with my blessings, without any merit on their part, and though they have been always ungrateful; whilst I have rejected Esau, and executed severe judgments upon his posterity. Not that God punished Esau or his posterity beyond their deserts, but that by his free election and grace he loved Jacob, and favoured his posterity above their deserts. See the annotations upon Romans ix. (Challoner) --- Neither deserved any thing. God's choice was gratuitous, both with respect to the fathers and their offspring. (Worthington)"
      v:003:
        - "MAL:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Esau,</i> perceiving the evil which was already in him, and would appear afterwards; (St. Jerome and Theodoret) or rather he was a figure of the reprobate, though not of course one himself. (St. Augustine) --- A person is said to hate what he loves less. Esau's privileges were transferred to his brother, who enjoyed a much finer country, and was chosen for God's peculiar inheritance. (Calmet) --- Temporal blessings are here specified. --- <i>Dragons.</i> Septuagint, \"houses;\" so that they shall be deserted. (Haydock) --- Edom was ravaged by Nabuchodonosor. The people retired into the cities, from which the Jews were driven. Yet afterwards they rebuilt their own habitations."
      v:004:
        - "MAL:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Down,</i> by the Machabees, who forced the people to receive circumcision, 1 Machabees v. 3. (Calmet) --- At that time the Jews were more pious, and glorified God. (Haydock) --- <i>Ever.</i> God's gratuitous love appears in his leaving Edom in captivity, and restoring the Jews. (Worthington)"
      v:006:
        - 'MAL:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Father.</i> God sometimes took this title, Exodus iv. 32. But he was oftener represented as a <i>master;</i> and the old law was a law of fear. (Calmet) --- <i>Servant et metuunt jus.</i> (Juvenal xiv.)'
      v:007:
        - 'MAL:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Bread,</i> including all the victims, &c., Leviticus iii. 11., and Numbers xxviii. 2. (Calmet) --- By vile presents they shew their contempt of God. (Worthington)'
      v:008:
        - 'MAL:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Lame.</i> The victims must be without defect, Leviticus xxii. 21. Those of the Jews were also rendered inadmissible by their evil dispositions, Aggeus ii. 14. It is surprising, that after such scourges they should not have been more upon their guard. The negligence of the sacred ministers, is a sure sign of faith being extinct. (Calmet) --- Pagans often thus treated their idols. (Clement of Alexandria, Strom. vi.) --- <i>Prince:</i> the governor sent by the Persians. If you dare not make such presents to men of eminence, how shall I accept them? (Calmet) --- How dare you offer them to me? (Worthington)'
      v:010:
        - 'MAL:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Gratis?</i> Are you not well paid? Why then perform you not your duty exactly? (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "Wherefore also among you shall the doors be shut, and my altar is not enkindled for nought," (Haydock) as if God menaced the Jews with the rejection of the temple, as the sequel does. (Calmet) --- <i>Pleasure.</i> Many other prophets had foretold the reprobation of the synagogue, but none more plainly. The reason is also assigned, viz., the ingratitude and repeated sins of the people, on which account the Gentiles of all countries shall be chosen. (Worthington)'
      v:011:
        - "MAL:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Sacrifice.</i> Protestant, \"incense.\" (Haydock) --- <i>Clean oblation.</i> The precious body and blood of Christ in the eucharistic sacrifice. (Challoner) --- This is denoted by the very word <i>mincha,</i> the offering of flour and wine. (Calmet) See St. Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho; St. Iren√¶us, Against Heresies iv. 32.; St. Augustine, City of God xviii. 35.) --- \"We pollute this bread, that is the body of Christ, when we approach the altar unworthily.\" (St. Jerome v. 7.) --- This sacrifice is always pure, though the priest or receiver be otherwise. (Calmet) --- Hence it is always <i>clean.</i> (Council of Trent, session xxii. chap. i.) (Menochius) --- It is offered daily throughout the world. The Jews see the completion of this prediction, and are vexed; they strive to elude its force. Though enemies, they bear about these proofs of our faith, and of their own condemnation. (Calmet) --- God not only changed his people, but instituted a better sacrifice. Instead of the former needy elements, (Galatians iv.) which were often defiled by the sins of the offerers, He instituted the sacrifice of his own Body and Blood, under the appearance of bread and wine, as St. Chrysostom (in Psalm xcv.), Theodoret, &c., prove against all opponents. A sacrifice different from any offered by the Jews, who could offer only at Jerusalem, (Deuteronomy xvi.) is clearly specified, as many have demonstrated. (Worthington) --- Christ's bloody sacrifice on the cross was performed on Calvary, and not <i>among the Gentiles.</i> What sacrifice can Protestants now produce? (Haydock)"
      v:012:
        - 'MAL:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>It.</i> The priests complain that all is burnt, (Grotius) or rather they treat sacred things with contempt. (Calmet) --- They falsely pretend that they give their best, being poor. (Menochius)'
      v:013:
        - 'MAL:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Behold of</i> our <i>labour,</i> &c. You pretended <i>labour</i> and weariness, when you brought your offering; and so made it of no value, by offering it with an evil mind. Moreover, what you offered was both defective in itself, and gotten by rapine and extortion. (Challoner) --- These were two defects. (Worthington) --- Hebrew, "what fatigue, or if we change one letter, and read (Calmet) <i>mothlae,</i> (Haydock) it stinks, and you." &c. Some copies of [the] Septuagint, Arabic, &c., "I blew them away," with disgust. --- <i>Rapine.</i> Ecclesiasticus xxxiv. 24. --- <i>Offering.</i> Mincha, ver. 11. (Calmet) --- Such victims and presents as are lame or strange, are rejected. (Pliny, [Natural History?] viii. 45.)'
      v:014:
        - 'MAL:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Male.</i> So better things are styled <i>mascula thura.</i> (Virgil; Pliny, [Natural History?] xii. 14.) --- It was unlawful to offer a female by vow, but not out of devotion, Leviticus xxii. 18, 23. (Calmet) --- <i>King.</i> So the Persian monarchs were called. --- <i>Dreadful.</i> Greek, "Epiphanes." (Haydock)'

    verses:
      v:001: 'MAL:1:1 | 1 | 1 | The {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}burden of the word of the Lord to Israel, by the hand of Malachias.'
      v:002: 'MAL:1:2 | 2 | 2 | I have loved you, saith the Lord: and you have said: Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau brother to Jacob, saith the Lord, and {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}I have loved Jacob,'
      v:003: 'MAL:1:3 | 3 | 3 | But have hated Esau? and I have made his mountains a wilderness, and given his inheritance to the dragons of the desert.'
      v:004: 'MAL:1:4 | 4 | 4 | But if Edom shall say: We are destroyed, but we will return and build up what hath been destroyed: thus saith the Lord of hosts: They shall build up, and I will throw down: and they shall be called the borders of wickedness, and the people with whom the Lord is angry for ever.'
      v:005: 'MAL:1:5 | 5 | 5 | And your eyes shall see, and you shall say: The Lord be magnified upon the border of Israel.'
      v:006: 'MAL:1:6 | 6 | 6 | The son honoureth the father, and the servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear: saith the Lord of hosts?'
      v:007: 'MAL:1:7 | 7 | 7 | To you, O priests, that despise my name, and have said: Wherein have we despised thy name? You offer polluted bread upon my altar, and you say: Wherein have we polluted thee: In that you say: The table of the Lord is contemptible.'
      v:008: 'MAL:1:8 | 8 | 8 | If you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil: offer it to thy prince, if he will be pleased with it, or if he will regard thy face, saith the Lord of hosts.'
      v:009: 'MAL:1:9 | 9 | 9 | And now beseech ye the face of God, that he may have mercy on you (for by your hand hath this been done) if by any means he will receive your faces, saith the Lord of hosts.'
      v:010: 'MAL:1:10 | 10 | 10 | Who is there among you, that will shut the doors, and will kindle the fire on my altar, gratis? I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will not receive a gift of your hand.'
      v:011: 'MAL:1:11 | 11 | 11 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}For from the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is great among the Gentiles, and in every place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation: for my name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord of hosts.'
      v:012: 'MAL:1:12 | 12 | 12 | And you have profaned it in that you say: The table of the Lord is defiled: and that which is laid thereupon is contemptible, with the fire that devoureth it.'
      v:013: 'MAL:1:13 | 13 | 13 | And you have said: Behold of <i>our</i> labour, and you puffed it away, saith the Lord of hosts, and you brought in of rapine the lame, and the sick, and brought in an offering: shall I accept it at your hands, saith the Lord?'
      v:014: 'MAL:1:14 | 14 | 14 | Cursed is the deceitful man, that hath in his flock a male, and making a vow, offereth in sacrifice that which is feeble to the Lord: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the Gentiles.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'MAL:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Priests.</i> Such, hoarding up riches, dishonour God and his sacraments, as if they were temporal things to be purchased, and so they scandalize the weak. It would be well for them if they were reduced to poverty, (ver. 2.) and would repent, as they will otherwise be deprived of eternal goods, having received their wages in this world, like <i>hirelings,</i> John x. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - 'MAL:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Blessings,</i> riches. The priests also blessed the people, Numbers vi. 23. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'MAL:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Shoulder.</i> I will cast away the shoulder, which in the law was appointed to be your portion, and fling it at you in my anger: and will reject both you and your festivals like dung. (Challoner) --- Hebrew now reads for shoulder, <i>zerah,</i> "grain," or seed. (Calmet) --- "I will menace you with the shoulder, and will spread dirt on your faces, <i>even</i> the dirt of your feasts," (Aquila) or "the ventricle of your festivals." (Septuagint) (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'MAL:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Levi.</i> When this tribe was chosen does not appear. Some think that he alludes to the renewing of the covenant under Nehemias, which seems best, 2 Esdras ix. 1, 38. I then promised you <i>life,</i> &c. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - "MAL:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>The angel,</i> viz., the minister and messenger. (Challoner) --- Priests must administer the sacraments, and likewise instruct the people, being God's messengers. (Worthington) --- The Jews were well acquainted with the law, Jeremias xviii. 18. --- The priests had to decide most intricate cases, Deuteronomy xvii. 9., and xxxiii. 9. (Calmet) --- The sentence of the high priest was received like that of an angel. (Diod. Sic. xl. apud Phol.) --- If such science was required under the old law, how much more is necessary in Christian priests, whose mysteries and duties are so much more important! (Calmet) --- <i>Ignoratio scripturarum ignoratio Christi est.</i> [\"Ignorance of Scripture is ignorance of Christ.\"] (St. Jerome in Isaias & hic.)"
      v:009:
        - 'MAL:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>People.</i> If priests comply not with these high functions, they are despicable here, and condemned to eternal torments, Jude 11. (Worthington) --- <i>Accepted.</i> Hebrew, "raised up faces," instead of reproving the guilty, Deuteronomy i. 10., and Leviticus xix. 15.'
      v:010:
        - 'MAL:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Brother,</i> in distress, 2 Esdras v. 1. St. Jerome mentions the tradition of the Jews, which supposed that the captives at their return dismissed their wives, and married young ones, though strangers, ver. 11. But this is not probable. Such women were ordered to be dismissed, 1 Esdras ix. 1., and 2 Esdras xiii. 23. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'MAL:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>God,</i> or one addicted to idol-worship, (Haydock) which was contrary to the law, Deuteronomy vii. 3. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "the holy things of the Lord, by what he has loved and done for strange gods." (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - "MAL:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Master.</i> Hebrew, \"the watcher, and him who answers,\" on guard. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"doth such things, till he be tumbled out,\" &c. --- <i>Him.</i> Septuagint, \"and out of those who offer a sacrifice to,\" &c. Such people shall be excluded from the society of God's servants. (Haydock)"
      v:013:
        - "MAL:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>With tears;</i> viz., by occasion of your wives, whom you have put away, and who came to weep and lament before the altar. (Challoner) --- Though divorces were tolerated, (Matthew xix. 6.) the more virtuous did not approve of them, particularly when a wife was put away who had been married in youth. See ver. 10. Perhaps this corruption had crept in, like others, (Calmet) owing to the people's commerce with strangers. (Diod. in Photius.)"
      v:014:
        - 'MAL:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Covenant.</i> The order established at first, Genesis ii. 24., and Proverbs ii. 17. The parties promised fidelity to each other.'
      v:015:
        - 'MAL:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>His spirit.</i> Eve received a soul from God, like Adam. Hebrew, "One (<i>Abraham,</i> Chaldean styled one, Ezechiel xxxiii. 24.) did it not, and he had the," &c. Septuagint vary. The text is very obscure. (Calmet) See Cap. Crit. iv. p. 317.; Grabe prologue. --- A strange god did not make women. The human race is best propagated, where polygamy and divorces are rejected. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - "MAL:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Garment;</i> viz., of every man that putteth away his wife without just cause; notwithstanding that God permitted it in the law, to prevent the evil of murder. (Challoner) --- The original may receive this sense; or the woman must blame herself if she were hateful, (Deuteronomy xxiv. 1.) and the man acted not treacherously. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"iniquity shall cover your thoughts.\" (Haydock) --- It should be \"garments,\" {GREEK:START endumata}Œ∑ŒΩŒ¥œÖŒºŒ±œÑŒ±{GREEK:END}, though St. Jerome and the printed edition read {GREEK:START enthumemata}Œ∑ŒΩŒ∏œÖŒºŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±{GREEK:END}, (Calmet) \"thoughts.\" The first part contains the objection, and the second God's reply. (St. Jerome) (Haydock)"
      v:017:
        - 'MAL:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Judgment.</i> Being scandalized at the prosperity of the wicked, (Haydock) they deny Providence, Psalm lxxii., and Jeremias xii. (Calmet) --- Yet the wicked are left for wise purposes, either for their amendment, or for the trial of the just. (St. Augustine, Psalm liv.) --- Those who are offended at their present success, (Haydock) think not of judgment nor of eternal goods. (St. Jerome)'

      v:011: 'MAL:2:11 | 11 | 11 | Juda hath transgressed, and abomination hath been committed in Israel, and in Jerusalem: for Juda hath profaned the holiness of the Lord, which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.'
      v:012: 'MAL:2:12 | 12 | 12 | The Lord will cut off the man that hath done this, both the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering to the Lord of hosts.'
      v:013: 'MAL:2:13 | 13 | 13 | And this again have you done, you have covered the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping, and bellowing, so that I have no more a regard to sacrifice, neither do I accept any atonement at your hands.'
      v:014: 'MAL:2:14 | 14 | 14 | And you have said: For what cause? Because the Lord hath been witness between thee, and the wife of thy youth, whom thou hast despised: yet she was thy partner, and the wife of thy covenant.'
      v:015: 'MAL:2:15 | 15 | 15 | Did not one make <i>her</i>, and she is the residue of his spirit? And what doth one seek, but the seed of God? Keep then your spirit, and despise not the wife of thy youth.'
      v:016: 'MAL:2:16 | 16 | 16 | When thou shalt hate her, put her away, saith the Lord, the God of Israel: but iniquity shall cover his garment, saith the Lord of hosts; keep your spirit, and despise not.'
      v:017: 'MAL:2:17 | 17 | 17 | You have wearied the Lord with your words: and you said: Wherein have we wearied him? In that you say: Every one that doth evil, is good in the sight of the Lord, and such please him: or surely where is the God of judgment?'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'MAL:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>My angel,</i> viz., John the Baptist, the messenger of God, and forerunner of Christ. (Challoner) --- His purity and office procure him this title. (Worthington) --- Afterwards Christ himself shall come, for the ruin and for the resurrection of many, Luke ii. 34. Hence threats and promises are intermixed. The evangelists read <i>his face,</i> making the Father speak, whereas the Son is introduced by the prophet, who however presently changes the person. It is all the same which person of the blessed Trinity speaks, as all act together. (Calmet) --- <i>Testament.</i> The Messias, the mediator of the covenant with mankind, (Worthington) with Abraham, and Moses. The latter calls him the prophet; (Deuteronomy xviii. 18.) and Zacharias, alluding to this text, explains angel in the same sense, Luke i. 76. --- <i>Temple.</i> The ancient Jews were convinced that the Messias would come to the temple of Zorobabel, and be its chief glory, Aggeus ii. 8. (Calmet) --- Their descendants put off the coming for some long time, though the prophet says <i>presently,</i> or on a sudden. (St. Jerome; Basnage vi. 26.) --- Some take this temple to be the womb of the bless Virgin [Mary]. (St. Cyril; St. Augustine, City of God xviii. 35.) (Calmet) --- The Baptist was conceived, born, and preached first; and shortly after Christ appeared. (Worthington)'
      v:002:
        - "MAL:3:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Coming.</i> This may be explained of [John] the Baptist, (Luke iii. 7.) or of the second coming of Christ; though his first coming shewed the hypocrisy of the Jews. They would not acknowledge him, but sought his death, and brought on their own condemnation. (Calmet) --- <i>Fuller's.</i> Septuagint, \"washers' herb.\" <i>Borith</i> is found in all the low places of Palestine, (St. Jerome) and probably denotes soda, (Jeremias ii. 22.; Calmet) or fullers' earth. (Haydock) --- Christ purified the religion of the Jews, or did what was requisite for that purpose. The people would not obey. Yet he established his Church in all purity."
      v:003:
        - 'MAL:3:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Justice.</i> This is spoken of the Christian priesthood, which far excels that of Levi, Hebrews v., and vii., &c. (Calmet) --- Many Jewish priests embraced the gospel, Acts vi. 7. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'MAL:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Years.</i> So in the mass we beg that God would receive the sacrifice, "as he received the presents of Abel." (Menochius)'
      v:005:
        - 'MAL:3:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Judgment.</i> He has answered (ver. 1, 2) the complaint of the Jews, chap. ii. 17. (Haydock) --- This he does here (Menochius) more pointedly. (Haydock) --- Christ condemned the world, as his spirit did likewise, John xvi. 8. He made an example of Jerusalem, which shewed that he would not leave crimes unpunished. We may also understand this of his last coming. (Calmet) --- God threatens to punish even secret sins, which are know to him alone. (Worthington)'
      v:006:
        - 'MAL:3:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Change.</i> Hebrew also, (Haydock) "hate <i>or</i> recommence." I do not strike the fallen. Did I spare Sennacherib? &c. Have I not protected the posterity of Jacob? How then can you say that I am indifferent about human affairs? (Calmet) --- <i>Consumed.</i> Septuagint, "you depart not from the sins of your fathers. You have rejected my," &c.'
      v:008:
        - 'MAL:3:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Afflict.</i> Literally, "pierce." Septuagint, "supplant," (Haydock) or kick at, 1 Kings ii. 29. But the term applied to Heli is different. Here it signifies to nail or irritate. (Calmet) --- <i>Tithes:</i> the payment is most strictly commanded. (Worthington)'
      v:009:
        - 'MAL:3:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Want.</i> Hebrew, "malediction." St. Jerome specifies the kind. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "and you obstinately turn away your eyes, and supplant me," &c. (Haydock)'

(Worthington) --- This sense is most generally given, as well as to those words where our Saviour speaks of the signs of the destruction of Jerusalem and of the end of the world together, Matthew xxiv. 3., and Luke xxi. 5. Yet the prophet may also allude to the punishment of the Jews by the Romans, when all were assembled at the Passover, (Calmet) a scourge which the Christians escaped by retiring to Pella.

Hence the prophet's meaning is not that St. John [the Baptist], but that Elias shall come before the great day of the Lord. (Worthington) --- Yet we may understand it of Christ coming into the world to preach, and again to judge. His first coming proved terrible to the perfidious Jews, whose ruin presently ensued. The destruction of Jerusalem was a figure of that which the world shall experience. (Calmet) --- This shall be preceded by the preaching of Elias. (N. Alex.[Noel Alexander?] Diss. vi.) --- This interpretation seems very striking and natural, though the prophet may have had the first coming of Christ and the ruin of the city chiefly in view. Our Saviour testifies that the Elias whom the Jews expected was already come, Matthew xi. 14., and xvii. 11., and Luke ix. 8. (Calmet)"

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - '<b>Malachias,</b> whose name signifies "the angel of the Lord," was contemporary with Nehemias, and by some is believed to have been the same person with Esdras. He was the last of the prophets, in the order of time, and flourished about four hundred years before Christ. He foretells the coming of Christ; the reprobation of the Jews and their sacrifices; and the calling of the Gentiles, who shall offer up to God in every place an acceptable sacrifice. (Challoner) --- He also clearly speaks of the twofold coming of Christ, preceded by [John] the Baptist and by Elias. Nothing is known for certain respecting this prophet. He inveighs against the same crimes as Nehemias, to whose covenant he alludes, chap. ii. 4. None was afterwards recognized for a prophet till the Baptist appeared. (Calmet) --- Both priests and people are here reproved, and the Jewish law yields to that of Christ. (Worthington) --- No date is prefixed no more than to the works of Jonas, Nahum, &c. St. Jerome seems to fix on the seventh year of Artaxerxes, when Esrdras came to Jerusalem. <i>Liber ejus pro titulo sit.</i> (Haydock)'
