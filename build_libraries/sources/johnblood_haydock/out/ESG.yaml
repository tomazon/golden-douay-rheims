        - 'ESG:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>In.</i> Hebrew, "and in." In this manner the books of Scripture are usually connected. Septuagint place first the dream of Mardochai, chap. xi. 2. (Calmet) --- <i>Assuerus.</i> Septuagint <i>Artaxerxes;</i> as [in] chap xvi. 1. The former is the title of the Median, the latter of the Persian, monarchs. This king reigned over both nations, and was most probably Darius Hystaspes, the third king of the Persians, (Tirinus) who subdued India, &c. (Herodotus) (Calmet) (Tirinus) --- Some understand Cambyses, (1 Esdras iv.; Genebrard) or Xerxes (Scalig.) or Artaxerxes Longimanus, (Bellarmine; Salien) or Memnon, (Eusebius) or Ochus. (Serarius) --- But (Calmet) the author of 3 Esdras iii. 1., and iv. 43., seems clearly declared for Hystaspes. (Tirinus) --- Though that work be not canonical, (Du Hamel) it may claim some authority, as an ancient history. (Haydock) --- This king gave orders for the building of the temple, 1 Esdras vi. 1, 14. --- <i>India.</i> Part had been (Calmet) subject to Xerxes. (Herodotus vii. 65.) --- But Darius subdued the country, and imposed a heavy tribute. (Herodotus iv. 44.) --- <i>Ethiopia,</i> beyond Egypt, paid an acknowledgment. Cambyses had taken possession of this country. (Calmet) --- Some understand a part of Arabia to be meant. (Du Hamel) --- <i>Seven:</i> 120 had been regulated by Darius, the Mede, Daniel vi. 1. (Haydock) --- The number might vary as the monarch chose. (Du Hamel) --- Herodotus (iii. 89.) only specifies "twenty." But he speaks of large departments, to which he intimates that several others were subordinate. (Calmet) --- <i>Provinces.</i> Hebrew <i>medina,</i> "seat of judges." (Haydock) --- Prefecture. (Menochius)'
      v:002:
        - 'ESG:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Captial.</i> Hebrew, "palace, (Protestants; Haydock) or castle," (Calmet) may also signify "a capital." (Montanus, &c.) --- Hystaspes founded this ancient royal city of Persia, (Pliny, [Natural History?] vi. 27.) or he greatly embellished it. (Calmet) (Ælian, Anim. xiii. 18.) (Tirinus) --- He seems to have resided here almost constantly. The preceding kings (Calmet) spent the winter in this warm climate, and perhaps the spring. See 2 Esdras i. 1. They spent other parts of the year at Ecbatana and at Babylon. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'ESG:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Reign.</i> When he was solemnly crowned, again, (Tirinus) or removed his court, (Calmet) and dedicated this new capital, with feasting, &c. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'ESG:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Days,</i> or a full half year, according to their reckoning. Nabuchodonosor, after his victory over Arphaxad, (Judith i.) feasted 120 days; Dionysius of Syrachuse, 90; (Aristotle) Solomon seven; (3 Kings viii. 63.) and David three; when he was recognized by all Israel, 1 Paralipomenon xii. 39. The Gaul, Ariamnes, gave a feast to all his countrymen for a whole year. (Athen. iv. 13.) --- The Roman emperors sometimes treated all the citizens of Rome, and Alexander did the like to 9000 of his chief officers for one day. But the magnificence of Assuerus surpasses all the rest. The Persians were famous on this account. --- <i>Persicos odi, puer, apparatus.</i> (Horace i. Ode 38.) (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'ESG:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Expired,</i> (Feuardent) or in the last week. (Menochius) (Calmet) --- <i>King.</i> The Persian monarchs delighted in agriculture. Cyrus the younger, planted trees at Sardis, and never eat till he had taken some exercise of this or of a military nature. (Xenophon Memor.; Cicero Senect.)'
      v:006:
        - "ESG:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Were.</i> Protestants, \"<i>where were,</i>\" white, green, and blue <i>hangings.</i> --- <i>Ivory.</i> Hebrew, \"silver.\" (Haydock) --- <i>Beds,</i> to lie down on at table; though sitting was formerly the fashion, Genesis xliii. 33. The other custom prevailed among the more luxurious nations, and was observed in our Saviour's time, each person reclining upon his left arm, and having his feet behind the next. (Tirinus) --- These beds were made very low, in Persia; so that Alexander had one put under his feet, when he sat on the throne of Darius, as he was not so tall. (Curtius v. 7.) --- Their magnificence was surprising. (Herodotus ix. 81.) (Calmet) --- <i>Variety,</i> in Mosaic work. (Tirinus) --- They lay upon sheep skins. (Chaldean) Septuagint, \"and the beds (or coverlets) were transparent, with various flowers, and full-blown roses, all round.\" (Haydock)"
      v:007:
        - 'ESG:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Vessels.</i> When Lysanias had taken the camp of Mardonius, and beheld the rich vessels, he could not help expressing a surprise that people possessing such advantages, should come to molest the Lacedemonians, who lived so poorly. (Herodotus ix. 79.)'
      v:008:
        - 'ESG:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Neither.</i> Hebrew, "and the drinking <i>was</i> according to the law." Greek, "was not according to the pre-established law;" (Haydock) as the usual custom was altered, on this occasion; and thus both may be accurate. The Persians had commonly a king of the feast, whose orders all were obliged to obey in drinking. (Horace i. Ode 4.) (Ecclesiasticus xxxii. 1.) --- This was an occasion of quarrels, (St. Jerome) and of intoxication. Agesilaus followed the example of Assuerus. Darius, and Cyrus the younger, gloried in being able to drink much wine without being deranged. (Calmet){JOIN}{BQ:2}-----<i>Reges dicuntur urgere culullis,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Et torquere mero, quem perspexisse laborant,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>An sit amicitia dignus.</i>----- (Horace ad Pison.){JOIN}Among friends, these "absurd laws" were laid aside.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Siccat inequales calices conviva, solutus</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Legibus insanis.</i>----- (Horace ii. Sat. 6.) (Calmet){JOIN}This may suggest to Christians, that they ought not to urge any to get drunk, (St. Augustine, ser. 231. de Temp.) lest they should be condemned by the very heathens. (Worthington) --- <i>Would,</i> and thus prevent disorders as much as possible. (Athen. x. 6.)'
      v:009:
        - "ESG:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Vasthi.</i> Septuagint <i>Astin.</i> (Haydock) --- Serarius suspects she was the king's sister, or daughter, as such marriages were common in Persia. (Tirinus) --- The name is not very different from that of Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, who was married to Cambyses, Smerdis, and Darius; to the latter of whom she bore four children. (Herodotus iii. 68., and vii. 3. --- This prince had other wives, particularly Artistona, (Calmet; our Hadossa, (Haydock) or Esther) whom he espoused a virgin, and love the most. Herodotus seems to confound her with Atossa. --- <i>Dwell.</i> Some Greek copies have \"in her own palaces.\" (Usher) --- It was proper for women to be more retired. (Menochius) --- The men feasted in the open air. (Haydock)"
      v:010:
        - "ESG:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Wine.</i> From the king's excess, and the haughtiness of Vasthi, God took occasion to advance Esther, and to deliver his people. (Calmet) --- <i>Mauman.</i> Septuagint, \"Aman.\" (Tirinus) --- But the names vary. The Persians seem to have had a predilection for the number seven, ver. 14. (Calmet) Greek, \"the seven eunuchs, ministers (deacons) of Artaxerxes.\""
      v:011:
        - "ESG:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Head.</i> But without any other covering. (Chaldean) Sulpitius entertained perhaps the same idea. <i>Stulto rege consultior, pudens, virorum oculis spectaculum corporis præbere jussa, abnuit.</i> (Haydock) --- Some Greek copies assert, very improbably, (Calmet) that she was sent for \"to be crowned queen.\" --- <i>Beautiful.</i> \"The Persian ladies were noted for beauty,\" (Ammian) insomuch that Alexander called them eye-sores, <i>oculorum dolores.</i> (Curtius) --- Only prostitutes appeared publicly at feasts. (Macrob. vii. 1.) (St. Ambrose, de Elia. i. 15.) --- In effect, Vasthi's refusal was conformable to the laws of the country. (Josephus) (Plutarch in Themist.) --- Her offence consisted, therefore, rather in her haughty carriage or words. (Haydock) --- For the proposal was neither decent nor safe for the king, (Grotius) as the history of Candaules shews. (Herodotus i.) (Not. Var. in Sulpitius)"
      v:012:
        - ESG:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Fury.</i> This is the usual consequence of excess. (Worthington)
      v:013:
        - "ESG:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>According.</i> Hebrew, \"knew the times, (for so was the king's custom with those who knew law and judgment.) And the next,\" &c. (Haydock) --- These were the magi, more particularly versed in the constitutions of the country. The Persians commonly held their consultations over wine. (Herodotus i. 133.) --- Septuagint, \"and the king said to his friends, Thus has Astin spoken; do therefore, in this affair, law and judgment. Then came forth to him Arkesaios and Saresthaios, and Malesear, the princes of the Persians and Medes, men near the king, and who sat first after the king. (Haydock) --- The old Vulgate places Mardochæus first. These seven counsellors were perhaps styled the king's relations,\" (Brisson i. p. 171.) and administered justice; as even the kings referred their causes to them. (Plut. Artax., &c.)"
      v:016:
        - 'ESG:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Mamuchan.</i> Old Vulgate, "Mardochæus." Yet the Jews say this was the infamous Aman; and one Greek copy has Bilgaios, (Calmet) and Arabo, "Mouchaios," chap. iii. 1., and xii. 6. He was the youngest, but spoke first, as was sometimes the case.'
      v:018:
        - "ESG:1:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Wives.</i> Greek {GREEK:START turannides}τυραννιδησ{GREEK:END}, \"princesses, <i>or</i> female tyrants.\" --- <i>Slight.</i> Septuagint, \"dare to slight their husbands. Wherefore if,\" &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Just.</i> Hebrew, \"enough of contempt and indignation.\" This may be referred either to the king or to the women's husbands. The example will prove a source of continual quarrels. (Calmet) --- Brentius approves the decision of this parasite; though St. Ambrose, &c., think that the queen was justified by the laws, which the king had no right to infringe, to gratify his drunken humour, ver. 10. Luther would also wrest this text in favour of adultery, p.ii. Divort. p. 177. (Worthington)"
      v:019:
        - 'ESG:1:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Altered.</i> This regarded the more solemn acts, signed by the counsellors, Daniel vi. 17. (Grotius) --- Some decrees were neglected or changed, chap. viii. 9., and 1 Esdras iv. 5, 21., and vi. 1. (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - 'ESG:1:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Counsel.</i> It was very inconclusive; (Menochius) and even supposing the queen were guilty of some indiscretion, the punishment was too severe. (Menochius) (Grotius, v. 11) (Haydock)'

      v:001: 'ESG:1:1 | 1 | 1 | In the days of Assuerus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces:'
      v:002: 'ESG:1:2 | 2 | 2 | When he sat on the throne of his kingdom, the city Susan was the capital of his kingdom.'
      v:003: 'ESG:1:3 | 3 | 3 | Now in the third year{VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0} of his reign he made a great feast for all the princes, and for his servants, for the most mighty of the Persians, and the nobles of the Medes, and the governors of the provinces, in his sight,'
      v:004: 'ESG:1:4 | 4 | 4 | That he might shew the riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the greatness, and boasting of his power, for a long time, to wit, for a hundred and fourscore days.'
      v:005: 'ESG:1:5 | 5 | 5 | And when the days of the feast were expired, he invited all the people that were found in Susan, from the greatest to the least: and commanded a feast to be made seven days in the court of the garden, and of the wood, which was planted by the care and the hand of the king.'
      v:006: 'ESG:1:6 | 6 | 6 | And there were hung up on every side sky-coloured, and green, and violet hangings, fastened with cords of silk, and of purple, which were put into rings of ivory, and were held up with marble pillars. The beds, also, were of gold and silver, placed in order upon a floor, paved with porphyry and white marble: which was embellished with painting of wonderful variety.'
      v:007: "ESG:1:7 | 7 | 7 | And they that were invited, drank in golden cups, and the meats were brought in divers vessels, one after another. Wine, also, in abundance and of the best was presented, as was worthy of a king's magnificence."
      v:008: 'ESG:1:8 | 8 | 8 | Neither was there any one to compel them to drink that were not willing, but as the king had appointed, who set over every table one of his nobles, that every man might take what he would.'
      v:009: 'ESG:1:9 | 9 | 9 | Also Vasthi, the queen, made a feast for the women in the palace, where king Assuerus was used to dwell.'
      v:010: 'ESG:1:10 | 10 | 10 | Now on the seventh day, when the king was merry, and after very much drinking, was well warmed with wine, he commanded Mauman, and Bazatha, and Harbona, and Bagatha, and Abgatha, and Zethar, and Charcas, the seven eunuchs that served in his presence,'
      v:011: 'ESG:1:11 | 11 | 11 | To bring in queen Vasthi before the king, with the crown set upon her head, to shew her beauty to all the people, and the princes: for she was exceedingly beautiful.'
      v:012: "ESG:1:12 | 12 | 12 | But she refused, and would not come at the king's commandment, which he had signified to her by the eunuchs. Whereupon the king, being angry, and inflamed with a very great fury,"
      v:013: 'ESG:1:13 | 13 | 13 | Baked the wise men, who, according to the custom of the kings, were always near his person, and all he did was by their counsel, who knew the laws, and judgments of their forefathers:'
      v:014: 'ESG:1:14 | 14 | 14 | (Now the chief and nearest him were, Charsena, and Sethar, and Admatha, and Tharsis, and Mares, and Marsana, and Mamuchan, seven princes of the Persians, and of the Medes, who saw the face of the king, and were used to sit first after him:)'
      v:015: 'ESG:1:15 | 15 | 15 | What sentence ought to pass upon Vasthi, the queen, who had refused to obey the commandment of king Assuerus, which he had sent to her by the eunuchs?'
      v:016: 'ESG:1:16 | 16 | 16 | And Mamuchan answered, in the hearing of the king and the princes: Queen Vasthi hath not only injured the king, but also all the people and princes that are in all the provinces of king Assuerus.'
      v:017: 'ESG:1:17 | 17 | 17 | For this deed of the queen will go abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands, and will say: King Assuerus commanded that queen Vasthi should come in to him, and she would not.'
      v:018: "ESG:1:18 | 18 | 18 | And by this example, all the wives of the princes of the Persians, and the Medes, will slight the commandments of their husbands: wherefore, the king's indignation is just."
      v:019: 'ESG:1:19 | 19 | 19 | If it please thee, let an edict go out from thy presence, and let it be written according to the law of the Persians, and of the Medes, which must not be altered, that Vasthi come in no more to the king, but another, that is better than her, be made queen in her place.'
      v:020: 'ESG:1:20 | 20 | 20 | And let this be published through all the provinces of thy empire (which is very wide) and let all wives, as well of the greater as of the lesser, give honour to their husbands.'
      v:021: 'ESG:1:21 | 21 | 21 | His counsel pleased the king, and the princes: and the king did according to the counsel of Mamuchan.'
      v:022: 'ESG:1:22 | 22 | 22 | And he sent letters to all the provinces of his kingdom, as every nation could hear and read, in divers languages and characters, that the husbands should be rulers and masters in their houses: and that this should be published to every people.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'ESG:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Suffered.</i> He began to repent. The Persians used to deliberate when warm with wine: but their decrees were not ratified till they had examined them again the next day. (Herodotus i. 133.) --- This was not the case here; the king divorced his wife without any delay. (Calmet) --- Septuagint intimate that he presently lost thoughts of her. "He no longer remembered Vasthi <i>with any affection,</i> reflecting what she had said, and how he had condemned her." (Haydock) --- But the Alexandrian copy agrees with the Hebrew. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'ESG:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Beautiful.</i> Thus Abisag was brought to David, 3 Kings i. 2. The Turkish emperors select women from all their dominions, without distinction of noble or ignoble; as all are their slaves.'
      v:003:
        - "ESG:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>House.</i> Distinct from the palace, ver. 14. --- <i>Women's.</i> Hebrew, \"things for rubbing, (Calmet) <i>or</i> purification;\" (Haydock) such as perfumes, but not clothes."
      v:004:
        - 'ESG:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Commanded.</i> Hebrew, "did so."'
      v:005:
        - 'ESG:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Jew.</i> He was of the tribe of Benjamin. But all went by this name, after the captivity. Mardochai had probably returned from Jerusalem, seeing things were unfinished there, 1 Esdras ii. 2. (Calmet) --- <i>Semei,</i> who cursed David. (Chaldean) --- <i>Cis.</i> The head of the royal family of Saul; whence authors have concluded that he and Esther were of royal blood, (Calmet) and descendants of Miphiboseth. (Tirinus)'
      v:006:
        - 'ESG:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Who.</i> This may refer to Cis, the great-grandfather of Mardochai, if we postpone this history till the latter end of the Persian monarchy. (Du Hamel) --- But it more naturally applies to Mardochai himself, who (chap. xi. 4.; Tirinus) was led captive 80 years before, being then perhaps 10 years old, so that he would now be only 90; an age when many are fit for great things. (Calmet) (Cicero, de Senect.) --- He might even have been an infant when taken, and of course would not be much above 80 when he came into such favour. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - "ESG:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Brothers.</i> Josephus, ([Antiquities?] xi. 6.) the old Latin version of the Syriac, Abenezra, &c., suppose that Mardochai was uncle to Esther. But the Hebrew, Syriac, Greek, and Chaldean assert that he was only her cousin. Septuagint, \"daughter of Aminadab, (or rather Abihail, ver. 15.) his father's brother, and her name was Esther; and after her parents were dead, he educated her for a wife;\" {GREEK:START eis gunaika}ηισ γυναικα{GREEK:END}, as some Rabbins also maintain, believing she was an heiress. Yet other Greek copies, Hebrew, &c., read, \"he educated her as a daughter, {GREEK:START thugatera}θυγατηρα{GREEK:END}: for the damsel was very beautiful.\" He had probably adopted her. (Calmet) --- <i>Edissa.</i> Hebrew <i>hadassa,</i> (Haydock) or Hadassah, signified \"of myrtle.\" (Menochius) --- <i>Esther,</i> \"a sheep.\" (Calmet)"
      v:009:
        - "ESG:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>And he,</i> Egeus, <i>commanded the</i> under <i>eunuch.</i> (Tirinus) --- Hebrew, \"he quickly gave her her things for purifications, (ver. 3.) and her portions, with seven maids, suitable for her, out of the king's house; and he charged her and her maids to dwell in the best of the women's house,\" (Haydock) where things were the most commodious. (Calmet)"
      v:010:
        - 'ESG:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Would.</i> Hebrew, "had not declared." He was not influenced to treat her thus on account of her royal extraction. (Haydock) --- In effect, the Jews were despised. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'ESG:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Court.</i> He was one of the life-guards, chap. xi. 3. (Tirinus) --- This situation enabled him to disclose a conspiracy, (ver. 23., and chap. xii. 5.) as he often went to enquire after the health of Esther. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'ESG:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Turn.</i> This was rigidly observed, in that country, where polygamy prevailed, Genesis xxx. 16. (Herodotus iii. 69.) --- The wives were "shut up in separate apartments," (Just. i. 9.) in the remotest parts of the palace. (Calmet) --- <i>Twelfth.</i> A full year elapsed before they could be admitted. --- <i>A sweet.</i> Protestants, "<i>other</i> things for the purifying of the women." (Haydock) --- It would be difficult to form an adequate idea of the luxury of the Persians, if the Scripture had not informed us. The kings were not satisfied with one wife. Assuerus had 400; (Josephus) and Darius Codomannus carried 360 with him, in his expeditions. (Curtius iii.) --- Parmenio took an incredible number of his concubines, at Damascus. (Athen. xiii. 9.) --- They were not all treated alike, but all were very sumptuously adorned. Cities were allotted to furnish one with sandals, another with girdles, &c. (Cicero in Verrem. v.) (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - "ESG:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Abihail.</i> Septuagint, \"Aminadab, brother of Mardochai's father.\" (Haydock) (Ver. 7.)"
      v:016:
        - 'ESG:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Tenth.</i> Septuagint and old Vulgate, "twelfth month, which is Adar." <i>Tebeth</i> corresponds with December and January. (Calmet) --- Notwithstanding all exertions, Esther had been near four years in preparing; (Tirinus; chap. i. 3.; Calmet) unless some years had elapsed before she was brought, ver. 12. (Haydock) --- She was guilty of no sin in becoming an inferior wife of the king. (Menochius) (Tirinus)'
      v:017:
        - 'ESG:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Crown.</i> Literally, "diadem," (Haydock) which was a bandage "of purple, striped with white," by which the queen was distinguished from the other wives. (Calmet) --- The king wore "a four-square cidaris," with a similar ornament. (Alex. Genial. i. 27.) --- Only one queen was chosen from all the wives, and she was "adored" by the rest. (Dion. Athen. iii. l.) --- Though God had forbidden marriages with infidels, (Calmet) at least with those of Chanaan, (Haydock) a dispensation might be granted, (Exodus xxxiv.; Tirinus; 2 Kings iii.; Worthington) for a greater good. Esther was not puffed up with her exaltation, and refrained from all forbidden meats, chap. xiv. 15. (Calmet) --- If she be the Artystona of Herotous, (vii. 69.; Haydock) as it is most probable, (Tirinus) her two sons, Arsames and Gobryas, had a command in the famous expedition of Xerxes. (Usher, the year of the world 3524.) (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - 'ESG:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Servants.</i> Septuagint add, "seven days, and he magnified the nuptials of Esther." (Haydock) --- <i>Rest,</i> from labour. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "remission to all his subjects," of tribute, as was sometimes done. (Herodotus iii. 66.) (Tirinus) (Calmet) --- <i>Gifts,</i> on Esther. (Chaldean) (Malvenda)'
      v:019:
        - "ESG:2:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>And.</i> Septuagint, \"But Mardochai,\" &c. (Haydock) --- They say nothing of the gifts, ver. 18. --- <i>Second.</i> The same process had been observed before, when Vasthi was chosen. (Calmet) --- Mardochai was perhaps then one of the king's guards. (Haydock) (Ver. 11.) (Tirinus) --- This second inquiry is here specified, to introduce the following account. (Menochius)"
      v:020:
        - 'ESG:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Commandment.</i> No one interrogated her, as she had been educated at Susa, and was taken for a Persian lady, ver. 10. (Menochius)'
      v:021:
        - 'ESG:2:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Bagathan,</i> or Bagatha and Thara, chap. xii. 1. One of the chief counsellors was called Bagatha. (Haydock) --- But these two were porters, (Calmet) or guards, of the king, (Septuagint; Grotius) or of the treasury. (Vatable) --- Some Greek copies and the Chaldean insinuate that they were displeased at the advancement of Mardochai. The latter supposes that they meant also to poison Esther. (Calmet) --- It appears that they wished to make Aman king, (Menochius) and the detection was always resented by him, chap. xii. 6. (Calmet)'

      v:004: "ESG:2:4 | 4 | 4 | And whosoever among them all shall please the king's eyes, let her be queen instead of Vasthi. The word pleased the king: and he commanded it should be done as they had suggested."

      v:008: "ESG:2:8 | 8 | 8 | And when the king's ordinance was noised abroad, and according to his commandment, many beautiful virgins were brought to Susan, and were delivered to Egeus, the eunuch: Esther, also, among the rest of the maidens, was delivered to him to be kept in the number of the women."
      v:009: "ESG:2:9 | 9 | 9 | And she pleased him, and found favour in his sight. And he commanded the eunuch to hasten the women's ornaments, and to deliver to her her part, and seven of the most beautiful maidens of the king's house, and to adorn and deck out both her and her waiting-maids."

But she sought not women's ornaments, but whatsoever Egeus, the eunuch, the keeper of the virgins, had a mind, he gave her to adorn her. For she was exceedingly fair, and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable, and amiable, in the eyes of all."

        - 'ESG:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Aman</i> means, "a disturber." (Haydock) --- <i>Who.</i> Septuagint add, "Bougaios, or Gogaios." Gog designates Scythia, where Aman might have been born. Pliny ([Natural History?] iv. 12.) places there the lake and river Ruges. But the Bugean, in Greek, may mean, "greatly puffed up:" or it may stand for Bagoas, "an eunuch," (Judith xii. 11.) like Putiphar. --- <i>Agag,</i> the king of Amalec, 1 Kings xv. This title, like that of Macedonian, (chap. xvi. 10.) is probably used out of contempt, as the Jews fequently styled their enemies, "race of Chanaan," Ezechiel xvi. 3., and Daniel xiii. 56. (Calmet) --- Sulpitius takes Aman to have been a Persian. His Amalecite ancestors may have fled before Saul into Macedonia, though he himself resided in Persia, so as to belong to all those nations. (Tirinus) (Menochius) --- <i>Throne.</i> Thus were Joseph and Joakim exalted, Genesis xli. 40., and 4 Kings xxv. 28.

On certain solemn occasions, the latter at least exacted this respect from their subjects. But the pious Jews avoided appearing at such times, or the kings dispensed with them. The mere bending the knee, out of civil respect, would not have been objected to; and Mardochai says, he would not have refused to kiss the footsteps of Aman, chap. xiii. 12. (Calmet) (St. Thomas Aquinas, 2. 2. q. 84.) (Tirinus) --- But he could not give such worship as was claimed by the minor gods. (Worthington)'

        - "ESG:3:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Lot.</i> The Persians were much addicted to divination. The superstitious Aman, though he would appear a deity, was to be regulated by lots! Providence caused almost a whole year to intervene, before the cruel execution was to commence. (Calmet) --- Reason began to shew the futility of divination, (Cicero) but the Christian religion alone has been able to counteract its baneful influence. (Calmet) --- India is still much infected with it. (Bernier.) --- <i>Phur.</i> Hebrew, \"they cast Pur, that <i>is</i> the lot, before Aman.\" (Haydock) --- The explanation intimates that Pur is a Persian word. (Du Hamel) --- Yet Pagnin maintains that it means in Hebrew, \"to crush,\" a wine-press, or vessel; and the lot, which is thrown therein. (Menochius) --- Tickets, with the names of the twelve months, were probably drawn; and after the month was thus determined, Aman put in the urn as many tickets as it had days, and was directed to pitch upon the 13th. Septuagint have the 14th, both here and ver. 13. (Calmet) --- How preposterous was the (Haydock) fury of this man, thus to decide upon the day before he had the king's leave! (Worthington)"

(Calmet) --- Hebrew, \"and dispersed; and their laws are different from all other people's; neither do they observe the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to tolerate them.\" (Haydock) --- These are the old calumnies repeated by Tacitus, (Hist. v.) and ably refuted by Josephus. (contra Apion) Almost all Israel still continued about Media. Few had taken advantage of the decree of Cyrus."
      v:009:
        - "ESG:3:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Talents.</i> Hebrew, &c., add, \"of silver.\" (Menochius) --- If the Hebrew talent be meant, this sum would be immense for an individual; (Calmet) though Aman might expect to raise it by the confiscation of the Jews' effects, ver. 13. Some think he speaks of the Babylonian talent, on which supposition the sum would amount to twenty-one millions of French livres, (Bude.; Calmet) or of the Attic one, which is worth half the Hebrew talent. The king might thus be prevented from thinking that the tributes would be lessened. (Tirinus)"

They called these messengers Astandæ, or Angari, Matthew v. 41. Darius Condomanus was one of these postilions, before he came to the crown. (Calmet) --- At first the kings had people stationed on eminences, at a convenient distance, to make themselves heard, when they had to communicate some public news. (Diod. xix. p. 680.) --- Cyrus afterwards appointed horsemen, to succeed each other. (Xenophon, Cyrop. viii.) --- Cæsar made some regulations on this head, which were perfected by Augustus and Adrian; but being neglected, Charlemagne strove to restore them: yet it is thought that the posts were not established, in France, till the reign of Louis XI.

      v:011: "ESG:4:11 | 11 | 11 | All the king's servants, and all the provinces that are under his dominion, know that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the king's inner court, who is not called for, is immediately to be put to death without any delay: except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him, in token of clemency, that so he may live. How then can I go in to the king, who, for these thirty days now, have not been called unto him?"
      v:012: 'ESG:4:12 | 12 | 12 | And when Mardochai had heard this,'
      v:013: "ESG:4:13 | 13 | 13 | He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save thy life only, because thou art in the king's house, more than all the Jews:"
      v:014: "ESG:4:14 | 14 | 14 | For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the Jews shall be delivered by some other occasion: and thou, and thy father's house shall perish. And who knoweth whether thou art not, therefore, come to the kingdom, that thou mightest be ready in such a time as this?"
      v:015: 'ESG:4:15 | 15 | 15 | And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:'
      v:016: 'ESG:4:16 | 16 | 16 | Go, and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in Susan, and pray ye for me. Neither eat, nor drink, for three days and three nights: and I, with my handmaids, will fast in like manner, and then I will go in to the king, against the law, not being called, and expose myself to death and to danger.'
      v:017: 'ESG:4:17 | 17 | 17 | So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him.'

        - 'ESG:5:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>And.</i> Instead of these two verses, the Septuagint place (Haydock) what we have [in] chap. xv., with some small variation from the present account in Hebrew. But there is nothing incompatible with the truth. (Calmet) --- The king might be at first displeased; but, seeing the effect which it had upon Esther, he might feel his former sentiments of love rekindle. (Calmet) (Tirinus) --- <i>House,</i> or inner apartment, chap. iv. 11. The throne was surprizingly magnificent, yet inferior to that of Solomon, 3 Kings x. 18. (Calmet) --- It was formed of gold and precious stones, with a curtain over it of purple and other colours. (Athen. xi. 2.)'
      v:002:
        - 'ESG:5:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Golden.</i> "It is not this golden sceptre which saves the kingdom," said Cyrus, "but faithful friends are the most true and secure sceptre for kings." (Cyrop. viii.) (Calmet) --- <i>Kissed.</i> Hebrew, "touched." (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - 'ESG:5:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Kingdom.</i> Chap. vii. 2. This compliment only (Calmet) meant, that every rational (Haydock) request should be granted, Mark. vi. 23.'
      v:004:
        - 'ESG:5:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Prepared.</i> It was not prudent to declare her request, when many improper persons were present; and Aman was not there. (Menochius) --- She thought that the hilarity, occasioned by innocent feasting, (Haydock) might be a means of obtaining more effectually what she wanted. (Menochius) --- If the prudence of this world suggest much address, why may not virtue employ the same arts for good purposes? Esther had to obtain two great points; to make the king retract his edict, and to abandon his favourite. She is afraid therefore of being too hasty, (Calmet) and invites the king again, to increase by this delay his desire of knowing her request, and that he might bind himself to grant it more effectually. (Worthington) --- She invites Aman alone, who would thus be more envied by the other courtiers; (Lyranus) while she manifested an open dispostion, and disdained to accuse the absent. (Tirinus)'
      v:006:
        - 'ESG:5:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Wine.</i> The Persians did not drink till the end of the feast, (as the Turks are said to do at present. Tavernier) when they fall upon wine without any moderation. (Ælian, Hist. xii. 1.)'
      v:011:
        - 'ESG:5:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Children.</i> After military glory, this was deemed the greatest. The king sent presents yearly to those who had most children. (Herodotus i. 136.)'
      v:012:
        - "ESG:5:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>But me.</i> It was thought very singular, when Artaxerxes invited his own brothers. (Plut.) --- But when he also admitted a foreigner, the nobility became jealous, as that honour was reserved for the king's relations. (Athen. i.) --- <i>Dine,</i> or feast. Only one meal was taken, (Herodotus vii. 120.) and that in the evening. (Calmet)"

        - 'ESG:5:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Whereas.</i> Septuagint, "all these things do not satisfy me, while I behold," &c. Such is the insatiable nature of ambition! (Haydock) --- <i>Gate.</i> He does not clearly mention that he wanted to be adored. (Menochius)'
      v:014:
        - 'ESG:5:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>High.</i> This was to increase the shame. Hence Galba condemned a Roman citizen to be hung on a high white cross. (Suetonius ix.) --- The Jews formerly burned a man in effigy with a cross, pretending to do it in detestation of Aman, but in reality to deride our Saviour, till the emperors forbade the custom, chap. ix. 21. (Calmet) (Just. and Theodos.) (Calmet)'

      v:002: 'ESG:5:2 | 2 | 2 | And when he saw Esther, the queen, standing, she pleased his eyes, and he held out toward her the golden sceptre, which he held in his hand: and she drew near, and kissed the top of his sceptre.'

      v:009: 'ESG:5:9 | 9 | 9 | So Aman went out that day joyful and merry. And when he saw Mardochai sitting before the gate of the palace, and that he not only did not rise up to honour him, but did not so much as move from the place where he sat, he was exceedingly angry:'
      v:010: 'ESG:5:10 | 10 | 10 | But dissembling his anger, and returning into his house, he called together to him his friends, and Zares, his wife:'
      v:011: 'ESG:5:11 | 11 | 11 | And he declared to them the greatness of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and with how great glory the king had advanced him above all his princes and servants.'

      v:013: "ESG:5:13 | 13 | 13 | And whereas I have all these things, I think I have nothing, so long as I see Mardochai, the Jew, sitting before the king's gate."
      v:014: 'ESG:5:14 | 14 | 14 | Then Zares, his wife, and the rest of his friends, answered him: Order a great beam to be prepared, fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak to the king, that Mardochai may be hanged upon it, and so thou shalt go full of joy with the king to the banquet. The counsel pleased him, and he commanded a high gibbet to be prepared.'

(Haydock) --- Providence watched over the welfare of his people. --- <i>Chronicles.</i> The kings took particular care (Calmet) to have their benefactors mentioned in history and rewarded. (Herodotus viii. 85.) Assuerus had not recourse to musicians, &c., wisely (Tirinus) reflecting that history is the most pleasing and useful amusement. (Cicero, &c.) (Tirinus) --- God directed him on this occasion, as his eye never sleepeth. (Josephus) (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - 'ESG:6:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>No reward at all.</i> He received some presents from the king; (chap. xii. 5.) but these were so inconsiderable in the opinion of the courtiers, that they esteemed them as nothing at all; (Challoner) and they were not specified in the history. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - 'ESG:6:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Inner court.</i> To which only such favourites and noblemen had access. (Herodotus iii. 72., and 84.) This king had himself come thither with six others, when they conspired to destroy Smerdis. Hebrew, &c., read, "the outward court," in which Aman was, till he heard the king was awake, and called for him. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - 'ESG:6:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Apparel.</i> Greek, "of byssus," which was very superb, chap. xv. 9. The king alone could wear the tiara upright. The nobles wore it hanging backwards. Cyrus allowed his nobility to appear in purple, but he would have only his own robes striped with white. (Cyrop. viii.; Curtius iii.) --- The kings often made presents of garments, &c., to ambassadors, and to those who were styled "their relations." --- <i>Horse:</i> 200 such appeared in the train of Cyrus, with golden bits, which none were permitted to use without special leave. --- <i>Head.</i> Greek seems to refer this to the horse, which might indeed have a sort of crown. But the golden one was more probably worn by the person honoured, chap. viii. 15.'
      v:009:
        - 'ESG:6:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Nobles.</i> Literally, "tyrants." (Haydock) --- But this word was not formerly odious; as it only denoted "a prince." <i>Pars mihi pacis erit dextram tetigisse tyranni.</i> (Vigil, Æneid vii.) --- Abuse of power caused it to become hateful. (Tirinus)'
      v:010:
        - 'ESG:6:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Spoken.</i> The distinction was not for one day only. Mardochai might afterwards wear the tiara, &c. God thus clearly manifested that he would resist the proud, and give grace to the humble. (St. James iv. 6.) The exaltation of Joseph in Egypt, (Calmet) and lately of Daniel at the court at Babylon, (Tirinus) was hardly less wonderful, Genesis xli., and Daniel vi. (Calmet) --- We may easily conceive the astonishment which would fill the breast of Aman, as well as of Mardochai, on this occasion. The Greek published by Usher, has expressed these sentiments; (Haydock) and the Chaldean has added many embellishments, which are of no authority. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'ESG:6:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Covered.</i> To hide his shame, (Tirinus) as Demosthenes did, when the people kissed him. (Plutarch) See 2 Kings xv., and Ezechiel xii. 6.'

        - "ESG:6:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Wise men.</i> Probably the magi, who concluded, from the first miscarriage, that the undertaking would prove abortive, (Calmet) as they were also informed of God's protection given repeatedly to the Jews. Septuagint, \"because the living God is with him.\" (Chaldean) They might have heard of the fate of Sennacherib and of Holofernes, (Calmet) or of God's promises, (Genesis xiii., and xv.) unless they were guided by human prudence.

(Haydock) --- The kings of Persia had taken many precautions not to be thus deluded, having appointed officers, who were styled "the eyes and ears" of the king, purposely to obtain all necessary information. But these eyes were often darkened; these ears were often deaf, (Calmet) and unwilling to act with fidelity; (Haydock) though their diligence in make secret transactions known, caused the people to look upon their kings as gods.

      v:004: 'ESG:8:4 | 4 | 4 | But he, as the manner was, held out the golden sceptre with his hand, which was the sign of clemency: and she arose up and stood before him,'

      v:008: "ESG:8:8 | 8 | 8 | Write ye, therefore, to the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king's name, and seal the letters with my ring. For this was the custom, that no man durst gainsay the letters which were sent in the king's name, and were sealed with his ring."
      v:009: "ESG:8:9 | 9 | 9 | Then the king's scribes and secretaries were called for (now it was the time of the third month, which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day of the month, and letters were written, as Mardochai had a mind, to the Jews, and to the governors, and to the deputies, and to the judges, who were rulers over the hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia: to province and province, to people and people, according to their languages and characters, and to the Jews, according as they could read and hear."
      v:010: "ESG:8:10 | 10 | 10 | And these letters which were sent in the king's name, were sealed with his ring, and sent by posts: who were to run through all the provinces, to prevent the former letters with new messages."

      v:017: "ESG:8:17 | 17 | 17 | And in all peoples, cities, and provinces, whithersoever the king's commandments came, there was wonderful rejoicing feasts, and banquets, and keeping holyday; insomuch that many of other nations and religion, joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies.

The Jews, on this occasion, by authority from the king, were made executioners of the public justice, for punishing by death a crime worthy of death, viz., a malicious conspiracy for extripating their whole nation; (Challoner) so inscrutable are the judgments of God, who never wholly abandoned his people! The old Vulgate passes over the first 19 verses, with the 24th, 25th, and 28th. (Calmet) --- In this whole history we cannot but admire the Providence of God. (Worthington)"

(Serarius) (Salien) (Menochius) --- These are the <i>kindred,</i> specified nine months before, chap. xvi. (Tirinus) --- Some Masorets childishly (Haydock) write these ten names one over another, and with greater and less letters, to shew that they were hung one above another, and that the guilt of all was not the same, but the youngest son was the most malicious.

        - "ESG:9:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Susan.</i> Aman's influence had been the greatest there, and had stirred up many enemies to the Jews, who were to be carefully sought out. (Haydock) --- If we should consider only the dictates of clemency, we should think that the Jews were too eager in their revenge. But when we reflect, that their enemies had intended to destroy them all, and to seize their effects, we shall allow that they did not exceed the limits of justice, as they acted by royal authority, and abstained from touching any effects of the deceased. (Calmet) --- In the capital, 800 men fell victims to their fury. But as the citizens of that place were probably the most guilty, we must not imagine that other cities would be treated with the like severity.

(Tirinus) (Calmet) (Worthington) --- Yet it would seem that both <i>days</i> were enjoined, ver. 27, 28. (Haydock) --- The Jews still observe, them, as they gratify their vanity and vindictive spirit. The 13th is kept a rigid fast, for all above sixteen, for twenty-four hours, during which they eat nothing. (Calmet) --- If that day should be a sabbath, or its eve, they fast on the 11th or 12th. (Drusius) --- The day before the festival they give alms to their poor brethren, enjoining them to consume the whole in making good cheer. Each person must then contribute the half sicle, (Exodus xxx. 13.) which is bestowed on those who undertake a pilgrimage to the land of promise. At night, when the feast commences, they light the lamps, and begin to read the Book of Esther, as soon as the stars appear. They use an old parchment manuscript roll, and, in five places, the reader shouts with all his might, running over the names of the ten sons of Aman with all haste, to shew that they all died in a moment. Whenever Aman is mentioned, the children beat the benches with mallets; and formerly they used to strike at a stone, on which his name was cut, till it broke, ver. 31. After the lecture, they take a repast at home. Early the next morning they return to the synagogue, and read the account of Amalec from the Pentateuch, and repeat the Book of Esther, with the aforesaid ceremonies. The rest of the day they spend in merriment. Their teachers allow them to drink till they are unable to distinguish the name of Aman from that of Mardochai. (Basnage, vi. 15.) --- They also change clothes, in contradiction to the law; (Deuteronomy xxii. 5.) and were formerly accustomed to crucify a man of straw, which they burnt with the cross, till Christian emperors put a stop to them; as it was concluded, from their curses, &c., that they had an eye to our Saviour.

(Calmet) --- Septuagint, "and queen Esther, daughter of Aminadab, &c.,...wrote all that they had done, and also the confirmation of the epistle of the Phrourai." They should say Phurim, as the former word means "guards." Hebrew, "wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim;" (Protestants; Haydock) or rather, "this letter, Phurim, of which this is a copy." The Roman Septuagint only add for this and the following chapter, to v. 9: "They set them apart during their lives, and by their advice; (Calmet; Ed. Alex.[Alexandrian Edition?], "for their health and counsel.") and Esther established for ever, and wrote as a memorial: My nation," &c. (Haydock)'

Yet we must not suppose, that the dominion of Assuerus extended over the whole world, no more than that of the Romans, who were styled masters of it. Before this king, the provinces had not paid tribute, but gave what they judged proper. But Darius laid a heavy tribute upon all, that, when half was afterwards remitted, they might esteem it a favour. The Persians hence looked upon him as a trafficker: {GREEK:START kapelos}καπηλοσ{GREEK:END}. (Herodotus iii. 89., and iv. 44., and vi. 7., &c.)

        - 'ESG:11:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Cleopatra.</i> So the kings and queens of Egypt were styled after Lagus; whence we can only gather, that this translation was brought after the reign of Alexander, and most probably under Philometer, the sixth of his successors. He was a great admirer of the Jews, and employed one Dositheus as his general, who might be the priest here mentioned; as such an office was not incompatible with his character. (Tirinus) --- Usher is of this opinion. See Josephus, contra Apion ii. But would he then be mentioned as if he had been a person almost unknown? (Calmet) --- We may say that he only raised himself by merit, after this time. (Haydock) --- Philometer reigned 177 years, B.C.[before Christ]. The Septuagint (Calmet) who gave their version in the 7th year of Philadelphus, (St. Epiphanius) were not the authors of the Greek edition of Esther; (Calmet) or perhaps, they may have adopted this of Lysimachus, (Huet; Du Hamel) as far as it went; the letter of Purim being only the groundwork of this history. If they did, Lysimachus must have lived before the time of Philometer; or what seems as probable, (Haydock) that the celebrated version has been made by different authors, and at different times. (Hody.) --- <i>Jerusalem.</i> Here St. Jerome subjoins, "This beginning was also in the Vulgate edition, which does not occur in Hebrew or in any interpreter," (Haydock) except the Septuagint.

We find the like in the books of Moses, and 1 Kings xvi. 10., and xvii. 12., &c.

      v:001:
        - 'ESG:13:1 | 1 | 1 | "Hitherto," St. Jerome observes, "the preface <i>extends.</i> What follows, was placed in that part of the volume where it is written, <i>And they,</i> &c., (chap. iii. 13., where the edict should naturally appear. Calmet) which we have found only in the Vulgate edition." (Haydock) --- Josephus produces this edict at length, but with some variations, (Calmet) which are of no importance. (Haydock)'

        - 'ESG:13:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>World.</i> This is an exaggeration. Princes are flattered with high titles, but none more so than those of the East.

Greek, "undisturbed by the stormy billows, ({GREEK:START akumantous}ακυμαντουσ{GREEK:END}) at all times; and that the kingdom might be rendered quiet, and the roads unmolested, to the very extremities; that peace, which is desired by all men, may be renewed." How amiable are these dispositions, which ought to be cherished by all princes! We might then hope soon to see peace restored. (Haydock)'

(Haydock) --- This king is represented as very stupidly giving orders for the destruction of a nation which he never names; (Capellus) but he intimates that Aman would do it, in whom he placed the most unbounded confidence. (Haydock) --- If the latter had any suspicions of the queen's being of that nation, he might very prudently abstain from mentioning the Jews even to the king, contenting himself with describing them so that they would easily be known by his agents; and, in effect, the king sufficiently pointed out the Jews, by saying that they followed laws different from all the world. (Houbigant) --- Infidels generally represent them as a wicked race, enemies to all but their own nation. (Tacitus, &c.) --- We need not wonder if Catholics be painted in the same colours, as the devil is still the same. (Haydock) --- <i>Fourteenth.</i> Josephus has the same day, though the 13th is specified in Hebrew, &c., (chap. iii. 12.) and in the Greek and Vulgate, chap. xvi. 20. We must, therefore, allow that the Jews might be slaughtered on both days, or that the Greek is incorrect in this place. (Calmet) --- Salien thinks it would not be lawful to spare the Jews any longer than the 14th day; (Menochius) or the carnage was to cease on the 14th, as it did at Susa, chap. ix. 17, 19. (Tirinus)"
      v:007:
        - 'ESG:13:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Hell.</i> Protestants, "grave." The king only wanted to send them out of this world. At the end of this verse, St. Jerome says, "Hitherto <i>is given</i> the copy of the epistle. I found what follows after that place where we read, <i>So Mardochai, &c.,</i> (chap. iv. 17.) yet it is not in Hebrew nor does it appear in any of the interpreters." (Haydock) --- He means, Aquila, &c. For he plainly asserts before, that it was in the Septuagint, which he calls the Vulgate; and all know that this version was taken from the Hebrew. The Church reads this prayer of Mardochai, (Tirinus) in the mass, against pagans, (Worthington) and 21st Sunday after Pentecost, &c., so that this is a part of Scripture which the Council of Trent will not suffer to be rejected. (Tirinus)'
      v:014:
        - 'ESG:13:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>To a man;</i> "as if," says Capellus, "the salutation and civil honour be not quite different from adoration or religious worship, which must be given to God alone. Neither did Haman demand religious adoration, but only salutation and civil honour....<i>To bend the knee</i> is frequently used in civil honour, nor is it necessarily understood of religious worship." May our English Protestants deign to borrow this grain of common sense from one of their foreign brethren, when they attempt to impugn the respect given by Catholics to the saints. (Haydock) --- "We grant that Aman did not require religious worship: but as the civil respect which he claimed, was to be performed in the same manner as the Jews worshipped God, Mardochai would not wound his own conscience, or that of his people." (Houbigant) --- Yet it is by no means clear that Aman did not insist on being worshipped as a god. It is evident that Mardochai understood him, at least, in that light, chap. iii. 2. (Haydock)'

        - 'ESG:14:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Lion.</i> This expression seems not sufficiently respectful. (Capellus) --- But why might not Esther use it with regard to one, who was raging against her people more than any lion, as St. Paul applies it to Nero, probably after her example? (Houbigant) (2 Timothy iv. 17.) --- David also thus styles Saul and his persecutors in general, Psalm vii. 3., &c. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - 'ESG:14:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Stranger.</i> Only those near Chanaan were forbidden to marry; and St. Paul commends Eunice, who had espoused an infidel. (Capellus) --- But this was not the reason of his commendation; for he ordains, <i>Bear not the yoke with infidels.</i> A pious woman might, therefore, very well refrain from such contracts, to which the Jews, at this time, were in a manner forced. Still Esther might have a conjugal love for her husband, (Houbigant) though she would have preferred to marry one poorer of her own religion; and here she only submitted to the designs of God, in raising her to such an elevated station. (Menochius)'

(Houbigant) --- <i>Silence,</i> when I am alone. Nothing could give us a higher idea of Esther's virtue and greatness of soul, as her elevation did not make her forget herself. (Calmet)"
      v:017:
        - 'ESG:14:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Me.</i> Ought she to have been thus affected towards her husband? (Capellus) --- Undoubtedly: as the meats and <i>the wine</i> had been offered to idols. (Houbigant)'

      v:010:
        - 'ESG:15:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Eyes.</i> Greek adds, "with glory," with which he was surrounded. This made him at first resent the coming in of women uncalled, till he perceived Esther, and saw her fainting. (Haydock) --- Capellus would represent this conduct of the king as ridiculous, and contrary to the true history. But this is false: and he improperly renders {GREEK:START agoniasas}αγονιασασ{GREEK:END}, regem concidisse & animo defecisse; as if the king had fallen down in a swoon; whereas it only means that he experienced those sentiments of anxiety which every good husband would do on the like occasion. (Houbigant) (Chap. v. 2.) --- Assuerus had at first only perceived the maid, who went before the queen, and the hall was very spacious. (Houbigant) --- <i>Pale.</i> Greek, "in a fainting-fit, and she leaned upon the head of her maid, (Abra.) who was going before."'

      v:001:
        - 'ESG:16:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>From India to Ethiopia.</i> That is, who reigneth from India to Ethiopia. (Challoner) --- St. Jerome writes, "The copy of the letter of king Artaxerxes, which he wrote in favour of the Jews, to all the provinces of his kingdom, which also is not in the Hebrew volume." It should properly occur, chap viii. 13, as it does in Greek. The edict is well written in that language, which has induced a belief that it is not a translation. (Calmet) --- But that is no very strong argument. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - 'ESG:16:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Princes.</i> Greek, "Beneficent," Luke xxii. 25. (Calmet) --- Greek, "Many of those who have been the most honoured by the kindness of the beneficent, have increased in folly, and not only endeavour to injure our subjects, but, unable to hear the weight <i>of favours,</i> devise schemes against their benefactors."'
      v:004:
        - 'ESG:16:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Neither.</i> Greek, "And they not only take away gratitude from among men, but elated with good fortune, which they had not before experienced, they flatter themselves that they will escape the sentence of an all-seeing God, levelled against the wicked." (Haydock) --- Artaxerxes insists with reason on the ingratitude of Aman, as it was a crime punishable by their laws; (Cyrop. i.; Brisson ii. p. 250.) and the Persian kings were particularly careful to reward those who had done them good. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'ESG:16:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>And.</i> Greek, "For oftentimes fair speeches, <i>or</i> (Haydock) revenge, ({GREEK:START paramuthia}παραμυθια{GREEK:END}. Isaias i. 24. Calmet) has made several of those who have been in authority, and entrusted with the affairs of their friends, partakers <i>in the spilling</i> of innocent blood, and involved <i>them</i> in irremediable calamities, by the wicked craft of those who purposely lead astray the unsuspecting benevolence of governors." (Haydock) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] xi. 3.) gives nearly the same sense: (Calmet) "For some of these, being placed in power by their friends, and bearing a private hatred towards some, have deluded their princes by false reasons, and by accusations have persuaded them to stir up the wrath of those who have done no wrong; on which account, they have been in danger of perishing." This author was not, therefore, unacquainted with the fragment, or part of the history, before us. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - 'ESG:16:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Proved.</i> Greek, "may be seen, not so much from ancient histories, as we have observed, but more so, if ye examine what wicked things have been done recently, by the fault (<i>or</i> cruelty) of those who have been unworthily in command: and if ye attend, in future, that we may without trouble settle our kingdom in peace for all men. For though we make some changes, yet we make a discernment of what falls under our inspection, and order things with more equity." He intimates that the former decree of Aman had been subreptitious.'
      v:010:
        - 'ESG:16:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Now.</i> Greek, "For as Aman, of Amadathos, a Macedonian, a stranger to the real blood of the Persians, and of a very different character from our goodness, and <i>who,</i> though a stranger to us, partook of that philanthropy which we have for every nation, insomuch as to be styled," &c. (Haydock) --- At this time the Macedonians were hardly known. (Capellus) --- But this may be questioned, as their kingdom was of ancient date. (Houbigant) --- Some think that the Asiatic Macedonians may be designated. (Hardouin.) (Pliny, [Natural History?] v. 30, 31.) --- These, however, may have been so called only after the conquests of Alexander. This king fought against the Greeks, of whom the Macedonians formed a part. (Tirinus) --- The name may here be placed only for a stranger. (Calmet) --- <i>Staining.</i> The faults of ministers often redound to the disgrace of those who employ them. (Menochius)'

        - 'ESG:16:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Life.</i> This he might only suspect; (Calmet) or his machinations with the two porters, might be declared after his disgrace. (Haydock) --- Capellus thinks it improbable that Aman intended to murder the queen, as he was so much elated at being invited by her to a feast, &c. But his schemes were various: (Houbigant) and who can pretend to say what would have satisfied his cruelty and ambition? (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - 'ESG:16:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Without.</i> Greek, "abandoned." (Haydock) --- <i>Macedonians;</i> or to himself, who was of that nation. It was not necessary to call over forces, as Capellus would suppose.'
      v:016:
        - 'ESG:16:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>God.</i> Cyrus had styled him, "the God of heaven." (Houbigant) (1 Esdras i.) (Haydock) --- But Darius embraced the true religion, and adored God. (Tirinus) --- <i>Fathers.</i> "Hystaspes was not a descendant of Cyrus, but he was of the same royal stock." (Just. i.) (Herodotus iii. 85.) --- <i>And is.</i> Greek, "by the best disposition. You will therefore do well not to make use of the letter, sent by Aman." The edict could not be repealed; (Capellus; Houbigant) though this seems doubtful, when it was manifestly subreptitious, (Menochius) unjust, and not sealed by the nobles. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - 'ESG:16:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Gibbets.</i> Aman was thus treated, several months before his ten sons, chap. vii. 10., and ix. 6. Yet all the family might still be seen hanging, when this edict was dispatched. Houbigant suspects that this and the following verses properly belong to the letter written by Esther and Mardochai. The arguments are not very cogent. (Haydock)'

        - 'ESG:16:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Days.</i> A festival was kept in memory of the destruction of the magi, in which this king was a principal actor. (Herodotus iii. 79.) --- The Persians were ordered to keep the 13th of Adar, on account of the preservation of the royal family, and the ruin of a great enemy. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - 'ESG:16:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>All.</i> Greek, "Salvation is to us, and to all well-affected Persians: but a memorial of destruction to all who are traitors to us."'

        - 'ESG:16:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>And.</i> Greek, "But every country or city throughout <i>the kingdom,</i> which shall not comply, shall be consumed with the spear and fire in wrath." --- <i>Beasts.</i> Greek adds hyperbolically, "and birds, and also be accounted most abominable for ever." (Haydock) --- Similar expressions occur in the prophets, to denote an entire destruction, Jeremias ix. 10., &c. Mardochai and Esther have left us in this work the most perfect example of virtue. The latter is given as a pattern of Christian sovereigns, and a figure of the Church. (St. Jerome ad Paulin. (Calmet) and prol. in Sophonias) --- Like Judith, she proved the salvation of her people, and the ruin of their adversaries. Nothing could be more striking, (Worthington) or visible, than the hand of God in these transactions. (Haydock) --- Esther was also a type of the blessed Virgin [Mary], by whose intercession the head of the serpent is crushed, and letters of grace succeed to the hand-writing that stood against us. (St. Thomas Aquinas, prol. in ep. Cath.) (Worthington)'

      v:013: 'ESG:16:13 | 13 | 13 | For with certain new and unheard of device,s he hath sought the destruction of Mardochai, by whose fidelity, and good services, our life was saved; and of Esther, the partner of our kingdom, with all their nation:'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - 'This Book takes its name from queen Esther; whose history is here recorded. The general opinion of almost all commentators on the Holy Scripture, make Mardochai the writer of it: which also may be collected below from chap. ix. 20. (Challoner) --- He and the queen were certainly authors of the letter, (Haydock) enjoining the celebration of the feast of Purim, or "lots," which is the ground-work (Calmet) of the present narration. (Du Hamel) --- The compiler has also had recourse to the archives of the kingdom of Persia: so that his work has all the authority that can be required of a profane historian; and being moreover inspired in all its parts, we cannot refuse to receive it with the utmost respect. Those additions which are not now in Hebrew, (Calmet) though they were perhaps formerly, (Worthington; Origen; Du Hamel) have been carefully preserved by St. Jerome, and were recognized by the ancient Vulgate, as they are at present by the Greek, without any distinction. Lysimachus, the Greek translator, was probably the author of them, chap. xi. 1. (Calmet) --- The objections of Capellus against this "Greek scribbler," as he is pleased to style him, despising the judgment of both Jews and Christians, are in general very unaccountably borrowed (Haydock) from the Latin version, and are easily refuted. (Houbigant) --- Those Jews, who have rejected this work entirely, with Melito, (Eusebius, Hist. iv. 26.; St. Gregory of Nazianzus, &c.) ought not to prevail against the consent of the majority, (Calmet) expressed in the Councils of Laodicea, Carthage, Trent, session 4, &c. To read this book according to the order of time, we should begin [with] chap. xi., ver. 2, &c., chap. i., ii., and xii., and iii., to ver. 14; then we find the distress of the Jews in the rest of that chapter, and in chap. xiii., to ver. 8, and their delivery in chap. iv. to ix., ver. 17, and chap. xiii. ver. 8, &c., and chap. xiv., xv., and xvi. The consequences of these events are recorded [in] chap. ix., ver. 17, &c., to chap. xi. 1., (Worthington) with which verse the book ends, in the Greek editions. (Haydock) --- They vary considerably, as did the copies of the ancient Vulgate, which called forth the complaints of St. Jerome, Preface. But the Church has distinguished what was spurious from the genuine word of God; so that the doubts of Lyran, Sixtus, (Bib. viii.) &c., respecting the fragments at the end of the book being not canonical, ought no longer to be indulged; much less can the boldness of many Lutherans, (Calmet) and particularly of Le Clerc, (Houbigant) be tolerated, who represent the whole work as a mere fiction. The Jews have a greater respect for it than for any of the prophets; whose works, they say, will perish at the coming of the Messias: whereas this will subsist with the books of Moses, and the feast of Purim will never be abolished, chap. ix. 28. (Maimonides) --- Ben. Gorion (ii. 2.) admits the additions. But Josephus is silent about them, as he probably did not find them in his copy. (Calmet) --- He recites, however, both the epistles of Assuerus. (Antiquities xi. 6.) (Du Hamel) --- It is not agreed whether these events happened before or after the captivity. But it is now most commonly supposed, that Esther was married to Darius Hystaspes, the year of the world 3489, about the time of the dedication of the temple, chap. xiv. 9. He had been on the throne six years, and reigned other thirty. See Herodotus vii. 4. (Calmet) --- Josephus thinks that Esther was the queen of Artaxerxes Longimanus, who was a great friend of the Jews. (Du Hamel) --- The Thalmud attributes this work to the great Synagogue, consisting of Esdras, Mardochai, Joachim, &c., and, as various persons might write the same history, the Greek, with the additions, seems to be taken from one copy, and the Hebrew from another rather more concise, (Huet; Du Hamel) but equally inspired.
