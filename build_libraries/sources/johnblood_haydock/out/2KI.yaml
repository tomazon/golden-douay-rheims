    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '2KI:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Rebelled:</i> literally, "prevaricated." (Haydock) --- The kings of Israel kept some of the nations, which David had conquered, in subjection, while the kings of Juda ruled over the others. In consequence of the late disaster, these people began to throw off the yoke. (Tirinus) --- Joram made war upon Moab, chap. iii. 5. God began to punish the house of Achab, by these means. (Calmet) --- The Moabites refused to pay tribute, (Menochius) as the Israelites would not acknowledge the divine authority. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - '2KI:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Lattices,</i> by a skylight, (Haydock) or trap-door, designed to give light to the room below, into which the king fell. The roofs are generally flat in the East, and covered with earth mixed with straw, with the light at the top, to prevent the excessive heats. --- <i>Of.</i> Hebrew, &c., "into." (Calmet) --- If the lattices be understood to mean the rails, which were ordered to be placed round the roof, (Deuteronomy xxii. 8.) Ochozias might fall into the street. (Menochius) --- Josephus thinks he fell from the staircase. At any rate, he was much hurt, (Haydock) and thus was made to feel the indignation of God. (Tirinus) --- <i>God.</i> Septuagint, "Baal, the god-fly;" (Calmet) the Jupiter of the Greeks, or their chief god; and <i>the prince of devils,</i> Matthew xii. --- <i>Accaron.</i> Hence Pliny ([Natural History?] viii. 29.) styles the god Achor, (Tirinus) and Myiodis, (B. xxxvi.) which is the name given to him by Josephus, ix. 2. (Haydock) --- He was supposed to free the people of the country from being infested with flies; or the many victims offered up to him, drew those insects together. (Vatable) --- Grotius supposes that the Phœnicians styled their god, <i>Beelsemen,</i> (<i>B</i><i>álssomin</i>) "God of heaven;" and that the Hebrews called him, <i>B</i><i>álzobub</i><i>,</i> "god of flies," out of contempt. But perhaps he is too favourable to the idolaters. (Du Hamel) --- Selden is convinced that Ochozias gives the idol its real name. Scaliger rather thinks that <i>Balzobéim,</i> "the lord of victims," was the original title. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - '2KI:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Away;</i> probably to his usual abode, at Carmel, where the king sent to seize him.'
      v:005:
        - '2KI:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Messengers.</i> They were perhaps citizens of Accaron, who had extolled the sagacity of their god, but were totally unacquainted with Elias. Yet as he shewed his knowledge of secret things, by telling them what they were going about, (Salien) and spoke with such assurance, (Haydock) they thought proper to return, lest they should incur a similar punishment. (Menochius)'
      v:008:
        - '2KI:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Man.</i> Hebrew <i>ish bahal sehar,</i> "a man lord of hair," or all covered with it, having a long beard, like the ancient sages, (St. Jerome, in Ezechiel xxxv.) and clothed with a skin, (Bochart) as the first inhabitants of the earth, the heroes, prophets and St. John the Baptist, are described, Hebrews xi. 37., and Matthew iii. 4. So Statius (ii., and iv.) says:{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Tiresiæ vultus, voces et vellera nota</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Induitur.</i>'
      v:009:
        - "2KI:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Under him;</i> his own guards. The captain was to request him to pray for the king's recovery; (Calmet) or rather, (Haydock) to punish him for what he had said to the messengers. (Calmet) --- <i>Of God.</i> Procopius and others think that he spoke contemptuously, and was therefore punished. (Menochius) --- <i>Down.</i> The prophets are not bound to obey kings, in the exercise of their ministry. (Grotius) --- Elias complies as soon as he had orders from God. (Calmet)"
      v:010:
        - "2KI:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Let fire,</i> &c. Elias was inspired to call down fire from heaven upon these captains, who came to apprehend him; not out of a desire to gratify any private passion, but to punish the insult offered to religion, to confirm his mission, and to shew how vain are the efforts of men against God and his servants, whom he has a mind to protect. (Challoner) --- The Roman laws authorize a person, in authority, to punish those who refuse to obey. (Ulpin 1 D.) <i>Si quis jus dicenti non obtemperaverit, omnibus concessum est suam jurisdictionem defendere pœnali judicio.</i> Elias acted as God's envoy, and the insult reverted upon him. (St. Thomas Aquinas, 2. 2. q. 108, a. 2.) --- The Manichees have blamed the conduct of the prophet: but the miracle justifies him, as God would never countenance the private revenge of any one; and the Holy Ghost places this transaction on a level with that when Elias shut up the heavens, Ecclesiasticus xlviii. 3. St. Peter was moved with the like zeal, Acts v. 5. The sons of Zebedee gave way to some private indignation, when they wished our Saviour to call down fire from heaven upon a city of Samaria, Luke ix. 54. But he reprimanded them for it; as the citizens might not be so well acquainted with him, as these soldiers must have been with Elias: and he came to display the spirit of mildness, (Calmet) to attract all to his holy religion; while Elias had manifested the severity of the divine judgments, conformably to the law of terror, under which he lived. (Haydock) --- In zeal of justice, Elias procured fire to burn these wicked men, as he had done for the holocaust. (St. Augustine) (Worthington)"
      v:011:
        - "2KI:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Another,</i> not knowing what was become of the first, or why he did not return; as Ochozias was eager to have the prophet in his power. (Menochius) --- If he were acquainted with his fate, (Haydock) this second captain was guilty of greater insolence. But there are such generally to be found at courts; men who are ready to execute the king's orders, without considering whether they be contrary to God's law or not."
      v:013:
        - '2KI:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Again.</i> This third captain is commonly supposed to be Abdias, (3 Kings xviii. 3.) though without much reason. (Calmet) --- John of Jerus, (c. 15) says he left the court, and became a disciple of Elias, and a prophet. (Menochius) --- But he is very different from the prophet, whose writings are still extant. (Calmet) --- The report of the two miracles had come to his ears, and filled him with fear. (Menochius) --- <i>Despise not.</i> Hebrew, "let my life....be precious in thy sight," 1 Kings xxvi. 21., and Psalm cxv. 15.'
      v:017:
        - '2KI:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>The second year of Joram,</i> &c., counted from the time that he was associated to the throne of his father Josaphat; (Challoner) so that it is said that he reigned also <i>in the 18th year of Josaphat,</i> chap. iii. 1. See also chap. viii. 16. To obviate these apparent contradictions, chronologists suppose that Joram reigned over Israel in the 18th of Josaphat, king of Juda, and in the second year after the latter had appointed his son Joram viceroy. He was associated with his father on the throne two years before his death, and in the 5th of Joram, king of Israel. Examples of this kind are frequent among the Hebrews, and particularly among the Persians, whose chronology is thus rendered very difficult. Why should we allow that the numbers are erroneous, when this explanation will suffice? (Calmet) --- Grotius leaves the matter undecided. (Du Hamel) --- Capel (Crit. p. 414.) maintains that the numbers have been ill transcribed; and so does Houbigant, who asserts that such a mode of writing would not be tolerated in a profane author; thus to mention different dates, without intimating how they are to be reconciled. If we should read, that Heraclius began to reign "in the 18th year of Chosroes," and a little after, that he ascended the throne "in the second year of the son of Chosroes," without ever specifying how Heraclius began his reign at two different periods, who would not suspect a mistake? Is it not more rational to throw the blame on the transcriber, than on the author? The modern chronologists seem to have invented the idea of viceroys and simultaneous kings, among the Hebrews, merely to get over difficulties; though the Scripture be entirely silent on this head. Houbigant would therefore read, "in the 22d year of Josaphat," as the mention of Joram seems here improper, (<i>absurda</i>) his father reigning 25 years. Ochozias began to reign when Josaphat had almost completed his 17th year. See 3 Kings xxii. 52. (Haydock) --- <i>His brother</i> is not specified in Hebrew, Chaldean, Arabic, and in some copies of the Septuagint, but it is in most others, as well as in the Syriac, (Calmet) Josephus, &c., (Haydock) and this is the common opinion. The Roman edition here inserts (Calmet) after <i>Elias spoke,</i> (<b>18</b>) "And the, &c....and Joram," &c., nearly as chap. iii. 1, 2, 3; only for <i>father,</i> it substitutes, "not like his brothers;" and adds, "the wrath of the Lord was enkindled against the house of Achab." No mention is made of the second year of Joram, &c., (Haydock) in any edition of the Septuagint. (Capel) --- In the mean time Josaphat, being returned from the unfortunate expedition with Achab, set his kingdom in order, purifying it from all the vestiges of idolatry, as much as he was able, and appointing proper judges, 2 Paralipomenon xix.'

    verses:
      v:001: '2KI:1:1 | 1 | 1 | And Moab rebelled against Israel, after the death of Achab.{VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}'
      v:002: '2KI:1:2 | 2 | 2 | And Ochozias fell through the lattices of his upper chamber, which he had in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, saying to them: Go, consult Beelzebub, the god of Accaron, whether I shall recover of this my illness.'
      v:003: '2KI:1:3 | 3 | 3 | And an angel of the Lord spoke to Elias, the Thesbite, saying: Arise, and go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them: Is there not a God in Israel, that ye go to consult Beelzebub, the god of Accaron?'
      v:004: '2KI:1:4 | 4 | 4 | Wherefore, thus saith the Lord: From the bed, on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die. And Elias went away.'
      v:005: '2KI:1:5 | 5 | 5 | And the messengers turned back to Ochozias. And he said to them: Why are you come back?'
      v:006: '2KI:1:6 | 6 | 6 | But they answered him: A man met us, and said to us: Go, and return to the king, that sent you, and you shall say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Is it because there was no God in Israel, that thou sendest to Beelzebub, the god of Accaron? Therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed, on which thou art gone up, but thou shalt surely die.'
      v:007: '2KI:1:7 | 7 | 7 | And he said to them: What manner of man was he who met you, and spoke these words?'
      v:008: '2KI:1:8 | 8 | 8 | But they said: A hairy man, with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said: It is Elias, the Thesbite.'
      v:009: '2KI:1:9 | 9 | 9 | And he sent to him a captain of fifty, and the fifty men that were under him. And he went up to him, and as he was sitting on the top of a hill, said to him: Man of God, the king hath commanded that thou come down.'
      v:010: '2KI:1:10 | 10 | 10 | And Elias answering, said to the captain of fifty: If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume thee, and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven and consumed him, and the fifty that were with him.'
      v:011: '2KI:1:11 | 11 | 11 | And again he sent to him another captain of fifty men, and his fifty with him. And he said to him: Man of God, Thus saith the king: Make haste and come down.'
      v:012: '2KI:1:12 | 12 | 12 | Elias answering, said: If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee, and thy fifty. And fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.'
      v:013: '2KI:1:13 | 13 | 13 | Again he sent a third captain of fifty men, and the fifty that were with him. And when he was come, he fell upon his knees before Elias, and besought him and said: Man of God, despise not my life, and the lives of thy servants that are with me.'
      v:014: '2KI:1:14 | 14 | 14 | Behold fire came down from heaven, and consumed the two first captains of fifty men, and the fifties that were with them: but now I beseech thee to spare my life.'
      v:015: '2KI:1:15 | 15 | 15 | And the angel of the Lord spoke to Elias, saying: Go down with him, fear not. He arose therefore, and went down with him to the king,'
      v:016: '2KI:1:16 | 16 | 16 | And said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Because thou hast sent messengers to consult Beelzebub, the god of Accaron, as though there were not a God in Israel, of whom thou mightest inquire the word; therefore, from the bed on which thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down, but thou shalt surely die.'
      v:017: '2KI:1:17 | 17 | 17 | So he died, according to the word of the Lord, which Elias spoke; and Joram, his brother, reigned in his stead, in the second {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}year of Joram, the son of Josaphat, king of Juda, because he had no son.'
      v:018: '2KI:1:18 | 18 | 18 | But the rest of the acts of Ochozias, which he did, are they not written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '2KI:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Heaven.</i> By <i>heaven</i> here is meant, the air, the lowest of the heavenly regions, (Challoner) through which he was carried by the ministry of angels, who directed the storm, (Haydock ) to the place designed for him. --- It is generally supposed to be Paradise, (Calmet) whither Henoch had been translated. (Haydock) --- They are still living, (Calmet) and must come again, to invite all to repent. After which they will die martyrs, in the persecution of Antichrist. (Haydock) --- See St. Augustine, de Gen. ad lit. ix. 6., and Apocalypse xi. (Worthington) --- Ecclesiasticus xlviii. 10. (Menochius) --- They are a proof of a future resurrection. (Calmet) --- To decide where the paradise which they inhabit, (Haydock) is situated, would be rash. (St. Chrysostom, hom. 21. in Gen. &c.) Some suppose it is still in some unknown region of the earth: others place it above the sky, (Menochius) or in the bosom of Abraham. (Calmet) --- The Jews (following Munster) assert that Elias penetrated the sphere of fire, where his body was consumed. (Vatable) --- The earthly paradise is very probably no longer existing, in its ancient luxuriant state. (Haydock) --- It may now be covered with the waters of the Persian Gulf. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - '2KI:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>The sons of the prophets.</i> That is, the disciples of the prophets; who seem to have had their schools, like colleges or communities, in Bethel, Jericho, and other places, in the days of Elias and Eliseus. (Challoner) --- Many of these disciples might be also their children. Elias collected some fervent souls together even at Bethel, to preserve the true religion, as much as possible. He visited them before his departure. (Calmet) --- <i>Peace:</i> let not Elias hear us.'
      v:005:
        - '2KI:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>From thee.</i> Hebrew, "from thy head," thy superior, and raise him into the air, ver. 3. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - '2KI:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Thee.</i> Elias had tried the constancy of his disciple three times, as Christ required of St. Peter a triple confession of love, John xxi. 17. (Haydock) --- Humility might also prompt the prophet to desire to be alone. (Salien)'
      v:008:
        - '2KI:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Mantle.</i> Septuagint {GREEK:START meloten}μηλοτην{GREEK:END}, "sheep skin," (Menochius) such as the prophets wore. The Syriac explains it of an ornament or bandage of the head; others, of a leathren mantle to keep off rain. <i>Ad subitas nunquam scortea desit aquas.</i> (Martial xiv.)'
      v:009:
        - '2KI:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Double spirit.</i> A <i>double</i> portion of thy <i>spirit,</i> as thy eldest son and heir: or thy <i>spirit,</i> which is <i>double,</i> in comparison of that which God usually imparteth to his prophets; (Challoner) or the power of working miracles, as well as of prophesying. (Worthington) --- He wishes to excel his fellow disciples, rather than his master. (Tirinus) (Cajetan) (Amama) --- <i>Double</i> often means, great and perfect, Jeremias xvii. 18. If Eliseus even begged that he might perform more and greater wonders than his master, (as Christ enabled his disciples to surpass himself, in this particular, John xiv. 12.; Haydock) he might do it without pride, purely for the glory of God. He certainly shone forth with peculiar splendour; and some have enumerated sixteen or twenty-four of his miracles, while they can only find eight (Lyranus) or twelve recorded of Elias. See Cornelius a Lapide, in Ecclesiasticus xlviii. 13. (Calmet) --- We read a similar expression in Pindar, (Olym. vi.) where Neptune gave his son Jamus ({GREEK:START Thesauron didumon mantosunas}Θησαυρον διδυμον μαντοσυνασ{GREEK:END}) "the double treasure of divination," p. 50. Ed. Step. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - '2KI:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Hard thing.</i> Hebrew literally, "thou art hardened to ask" a thing so difficult, and which I have not the power to grant. But I will pray that thou mayst receive it; (Calmet) and I feel confident that thou wilt, if God shall grant thee the power to see me, at my departure. (Haydock) --- This he did, ver. 12. (Menochius) --- Elias had perhaps imagined that his disciple would have desired some of his clothes, or some advice. (Calmet) --- He left him his mantle, (ver. 13.; Haydock) and by prayer was enabled to communicate his spirit to him; as Moses and the apostles did to their assistants in the ministry. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - '2KI:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Horses.</i> Angels assumed these forms, (Grotius) or a cloud, resembling a fiery chariot and horses, was impelled by a strong wind, under their guidance. (Tostat) (Menochius) (Salien, the year before Christ 914.) --- As the name of Elias is very like Helios, "the sun," some have supposed that they have the same meaning: (Sedulius, pasc. 1.) but the Hebrew term signifies, "He is my God." The pagans have taken occasion from this history to represent the sun drawn in a fiery chariot, by horses composed of the same element.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Animosos ignibus illis,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Quos in pectore habent, quos ore & naribus efflant.</i> (Ovid, Metam. xii.) (Calmet){JOIN}--- <i>Heaven;</i> (see ver. 1.) where he lives free from all disturbance. (Tirinus) --- It is a constant belief, that he will come again before the last judgment; as his representative, John the Baptist, announced the first appearance of our Redeemer. (St. Gregory, hom. 7. in Ev.) Of this the Jews were convinced. (St. Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho) See Malachias iv. 5.'
      v:012:
        - "2KI:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Thereof.</i> Thou alone wast equal to an army, in our defence. Chariots were then very common. (Calmet) --- Chaldean and Vatable, \"Thou wast, by thy prayer, better to Israel than chariots and horses.\" So we should call a person, a pillar of the state, &c. (Tirinus) --- In giving the character of Elias, the Holy Ghost dwells in a particular manner on his burning zeal. (Calmet) --- <i>Elias stood up as a fire, and his word burnt like a torch...he brought down fire from heaven thrice,</i> on the holocaust, and on the captains. (Haydock) --- <i>Who can glory like to thee?</i> Ecclesiasticus xlviii. 1, 4. See Sts. Ambrose and Chrysostom on Elias. His resemblance with Christ is very striking. His name puts us in mind of Christ's divinity; who burnt with zeal for God's house, (John ii. 17.) was persecuted, (Calmet) raised the dead to life, rose again and ascended triumphant into heaven, having imparted his blessing (Haydock) and his sacraments to his disciples. (Calmet) --- <i>No more,</i> as he was taken from the company of men. (Haydock) --- <i>Pieces,</i> to express his grief, at being deprived of so excellent a master. (Menochius)"
      v:013:
        - '2KI:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Mantle,</i> as an earnest of his affection. By the imposition of this mantle, he had been called to be a prophet, 3 Kings xix. 19.'
      v:014:
        - '2KI:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Not divided.</i> God thus prevented him from giving way to vanity, (Abulensis, q. 28.) or thinking that he could do any thing of himself. (Haydock) --- <i>Elias.</i> Hebrew, "where is he?" (Calmet) --- The original and Septuagint (Alexandrian and Vatican) do not specify that he struck the waters twice, or that they did not divide at first. (Haydock) --- This is taken from other copies of the Septuagint. (Amama) --- The exclamation contains a most fervent prayer. Hebrew, "he smote the waters, and said: Where is the Lord God of Elias? and when he had stricken the," &c., which removes the idea of presumption, which (Haydock) some discover in the words of Eliseus. (Tirinus) (Sanctius) --- <i>Now.</i> Hebrew <i>aph hu.</i> Septuagint {GREEK:START aphpho}αφφο{GREEK:END}, retaining the words which Theodotion renders "the hidden" god. (Haydock) --- "Even he himself." (Aquila) (Calmet) --- When I stand so much in need of his assistance, (Menochius) having to perform his important functions, which cannot be done without his spirit, nor without the confirmation of miracles, before an unbelieving people. (Haydock)'
      v:015:
        - "2KI:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>They worshipped him;</i> viz., with an inferior, yet religious veneration, not for any temporal, but spiritual excellency. (Challoner) (Worthington) --- They had stopped on a hill, (Menochius) to see the event, ver. 7. (Haydock) --- Jericho itself is two hours' journey from the Jordan. (Adrichomius) --- The sons of the prophets had seen what had happened at the translation of Elias, and perceiving that Eliseus was invested with his mantle, and with the power of working miracles, they did not hesitate to acknowledge him for their superior, during the absence of Elias, who they expected would return. (Calmet)"
      v:016:
        - '2KI:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Valley.</i> It seems such translations were not uncommon, 3 Kings xviii. 12. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - '2KI:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Send.</i> He acquiesces, lest they might think that he was afraid of losing his superiority. (Menochius)'
      v:019:
        - '2KI:2:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Barren,</i> owing to the salt or bituminous waters. Some think that they were muddy and of a loathsome smell. The fountain is still to be seen very abundant and excellent, watering the plain on the west of the city. Its source is about two miles distant on the road to Jerusalem. (Maundrell, p. 134.) (Calmet) --- Other parts of the environs were very fertile. (Menochius)'
      v:020:
        - '2KI:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Put salt.</i> He removes every suspicion of imposture: if the waters were already saline, the remedy would seem contrary to his design, but it would display the miracle in a stronger light; and if they were only fetid and muddy, (Calmet) though (Haydock) salt might rectify a small quantity, (Palladius tit. 9. Vales, &c.) it could never correct the bad qualities of such a fountain for a length of time, by the mere force of nature. (Haydock) --- Josephus (Jewish Wars iv. 8.) represents Eliseus acting like a magician, being desirous to please the pagan readers with various embellishments. (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - 2KI:2:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Barrenness.</i> By the divine power they are become salubrious. (Haydock)
      v:023:
        - '2KI:2:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Bald-head.</i> It is not known whether Eliseus was really bald, or only wore his hair short, like the priests of the Lord, and the monks at present. It may also be a term of reproach, of which the emperors Julius Cæsar, Domitian, and Otho, were very sensible. Cæsar wore a crown of laurel, and Otho a sort of false hair, to hide this deformity. (Suetonius){JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Quod summum formæ decus est, periere capilli.</i> (Petronius) (Calmet)'
      v:024:
        - '2KI:2:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Cursed them.</i> This curse, which was followed by so visible a judgment of God, was not the effect of passion, or of a desire of revenging himself; but of zeal for religion, which was insulted by these boys, in the person of the prophet, and of a divine inspiration; God being determined to punish in this manner the inhabitants of Bethel, (the chief seat of the calf-worship) who had trained up their children in a prejudice against the true religion and its ministers. (Challoner) --- The boys themselves were not so little as not to be aware of the insult they were offering to a minister of the God of Juda; and probably they acted thus out of hatred to him, at the instigation of their idolatrous parents. (Sanctius) (Calmet) --- <i>Lord.</i> He called on him (Menochius) to revenge his own cause, (Haydock) "that the people might learn to take care of their souls, by the fear of death." (St. Augustine) (Du Hamel)'

        - '2KI:3:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Baal.</i> This happened after his victory over Moab, ver. 13. (Calmet) --- Salien thinks rather that Josaphat refused to assist him, except he would destroy what had been lately introduced by his parents, as the league with Achab had been blamed. See 2 Paralipomenon xix. 2. The golden calves were of an older standing, and could not be so easily taken from the people. (Menochius) --- Joram was not so wicked as might have been expected. (Calmet)'

        - '2KI:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Nourished.</i> Hebrew <i>noked,</i> a term which the Septuagint leave untranslated, means literally, "marked" with some colour by the master.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Aut pecori signum, aut numeros impressit acervo.</i> (Georg. i.){JOIN}<i>Sheep,</i> Symmachus, "large cattle." --- <i>Fleeces;</i> is it commonly supposed every year. This mode of tribute was more usual than paying money. The Moabites were chiefly employed in feeding sheep and cattle; so that it is not wonderful that they should have such great numbers. Dejotarus is represented not only as "a noble Tetrarch, but also as a diligent husbandman and herdsman," <i>pecuarius:</i> (Cicero) which last is the idea which some attach to Mesa.'
      v:007:
        - '2KI:3:7 | 7 | 7 | He entered cordially into this war, as he perceived that if Moab succeeded, Edom would follow the same plan. (Menochius)'

(Haydock) Yet the want of water made this road more dangerous.'
      v:011:
        - "2KI:3:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Elias,</i> a proverbial expression to denote that he waited upon him, though the prophet's rough manner of living would require but little attendance. So John the Baptist speaks of untying our Saviour's shoes, Matthew iii. (Calmet) --- Providence had sent Eliseus to attend the army (Haydock) contrary to his custom. (Calmet)"
      v:012:
        - "2KI:3:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>With him.</i> I am content. (Haydock) --- Others read with an interrogation, as if the reputation of Eliseus was not yet established. (Menochius) --- <i>Him:</i> they go to his tent. No one ever supported the character of God's envoy, or shewed his authority over the most haughty, better than Eliseus. (Calmet)"
      v:013:
        - '2KI:3:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Mother,</i> whom thou supportest. This is not an order, but a sarcasm (Haydock) which the king deserved. (Calmet) --- Christ said to Judas, <i>what thou dost, do quickly,</i> John xiii. 27. (Haydock) --- With what liberty does the prophet speak to an impious king! shewing himself worthy to succeed Elias, and actuated by the like zeal for God.'
      v:014:
        - "2KI:3:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Reverence,</i> (<i>erubescerem</i>) \"blush at,\" may imply a degree of censure at Josaphat's being again found in such bad company, ver. 2. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, \"If I did not receive (Calmet) or regard the face.\" (Haydock)"
      v:015:
        - "2KI:3:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Minstrel.</i> The priests and Levites, who officiated in the temple, accompanied the army. Eliseus wants no profane music, (Calmet) but, by this request, shews his respect for the true religion, (Haydock) and by sounding forth the divine praises, in some of David's psalms, wishes to obtain of God the favour which was desired. (Theodoret) (Menochius) --- He had felt some emotion at the sight of Joram, and was sensible that God required a calm. (Calmet) --- He dwells not in a violent wind, &c., 3 Kings xix. 11. (Haydock) --- The surprising effects of ancient music to calm the passions are well attested, 1 Kings xvi. 17. By this means St. Francis was raised to the contemplation of heavenly things; and St. Augustine says of himself: \"How I wept when I heard thy hymns and canticles, being greatly moved at the delightful harmony of thy church:\" <i>suavesonantis Ecclesiæ tuæ vocibus commotus acriter.</i> (Conf. ix. 6. de C. xiv. 24.) --- <i>Upon him,</i> so that he experienced that enthusiasm which shewed that he was actuated by the divine spirit, to speak with all the authority requisite. The pagans strove to imitate the true prophets, but the difference was very evident; no less than the spirit with which they were filled; the former were agitated in a furious manner; the latter were composed and majestic.

(Menochius) (Worthington) --- <i>Stones,</i> which had been gathered off into heaps, Isaias v. 1. Persius calls a field thus cleared, <i>Exossatus ager;</i> (Calmet) as if the bones were taken out. (Haydock)'
      v:020:

        - '2KI:3:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Blood.</i> The clouds have frequently a reddish colour at sun-rise, which would be reflected in the waters: the sand might also be red. As the Moabites knew that no water could be expected there at that season of the year, and as some examples had occurred of people turning their arms one against another in the night, (Judges vii. 11., and 1 Kings xiv. 20.) they concluded that what they saw was blood. (Calmet) --- God had also destined them for slaughter, (Abulensis, q. 21.) and suffered their imagination and judgment to be deluded. (Haydock)'

It was also called Ar, or Arcopolis. --- <i>Remained.</i> Hebrew adds, "with the stones unmolested." They laid siege to it. (Haydock) --- <i>Slingers.</i> Grotius would understand those who attended the machines designed to throw stones, &c. But the slingers kept off the enemy, while others undermined the walls. (Calmet)'
      v:026:
        - '2KI:3:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Edom,</i> hoping that he would favour their escape, or because that part seemed the weakest.'
      v:027:
        - "2KI:3:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Wall,</i> to Chamos, the idol of Moab; (Menochius) or to Moloc, to appease the wrath of the gods. Horrible blindness! The pagans believed, that the most precious thing ought to be sacrificed in very imminent dangers. (Philo Biblius, following Eusebius, præp. iv. 16.) --- The Phœnicians offered such victims to Saturn. Many devoted themselves to death for the safety of the Roman republic; and some were ready to do so, to preserve the lives of Caligula and Nero, before they had given proof of their evil dispositions. (Seutonius xiv.) --- It is thought that Sennacherib intended to treat his two sons in this manner, if they had not prevented him. (Abulensis, in 4 Kings xix. 37.) --- Some imagine that Mesa sacrificed his son to the God of Israel, in imitation of Abraham; (Josephus; Grotius) others, that he slew the son of the king of Edom, out of revenge. (Kimchi, in Amos ii. 1.) --- The Hebrew is ambiguous. (Amama) --- But interpreters generally believe, that the heir of Mesa fell a victim (Calmet) to his father's mistaken zeal, or to his desire to make the enemy retire, when they saw him reduced to such a state of desperation. It had, at least, this effect. (Haydock) --- <i>Indignation,</i> at such a cruel action. (Menochius) --- Septuagint, \"there was great repentance\" and sorrow. The text may also imply, that God was displeased at Israel for pushing the king to such an extremity; or, they became an object of horror to the surrounding nations. (Calmet) --- The first explanation seems the best; as the Israelites thought the king had been sufficiently punished, and therefore retired. They had no reason to suspect that he would have given way to such madness, nor were they to blame for it. (Haydock)"

(Calmet) --- <i>Serve him,</i> not as slaves, for the Hebrews were not thus to be sold, except they had commited some crime. (Salien, the year before Christ 913.) See Leviticus xxv. 39. --- But the condition of mercenaries was perhaps little different; (Haydock) and we find that people were sold for debt, Exodus xxi. 7., and Isaias l. 1. The same practice seems to have continued till our Saviour's time, Matthew xviii. 25. Children were regarded as part of a person's property. The Romans, Athenians, and other nations, claimed the same right over them. (Halicar. ii. p. 96.; Plutarch, in Solon et Lucullus.)

        - '2KI:4:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>He said,</i> or "he had said;" (Junius and Piscator) so that we may include this and the following verse within a parenthesis, as alluding to what had passed before; (Calmet) unless the woman, out of modesty, did not come into the chamber of the prophet, who addressed her by an interpreter, (Menochius) or servant. (Haydock) --- <i>Army.</i> Eliseus had acquired great influence with Joram, in the war with Moab. (Calmet) --- The ancient canons exhort bishops to present the petitions of the poor to the prince. (Grotius) --- <i>People.</i> I have nothing to fear, (Haydock) and am not in want. (Tirinus) --- I have no quarrel with any person. (Calmet) --- I am of too mean a condition to have any thing to do at court. (Abulensis)'
      v:014:
        - '2KI:4:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>No son.</i> The desire of one was very natural, particularly to people in good circumstances (Menochius) and of the Hebrew nation. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - '2KI:4:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Womb.</i> Hebrew, "At this season, according to the time of life, (Haydock; <i>or</i> of a woman with child, Menochius) thou shalt embrace a son" in thy arms. (Haydock) See Genesis xviii. 10. (Calmet) --- <i>If</i> is added by St. Jerome, agreeably to an usual form of speaking. (Menochius) --- The prophet assures the woman, that she will not only live, but also bear a son, and nurse him. --- <i>Lie,</i> deceive, (ver. 28; Haydock) or flatter me with vain hopes. (Calmet) She might think that the prophet was not actually inspired. (Menochius) --- Through joy, she could hardly believe. See Luke xxiv. 41. (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - '2KI:4:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Carry.</i> This interpretation suits with the occasion, and is conformable to the Septuagint and Chaldean. (Menochius) --- Literally, "conduct him," but he was sick and little. (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - '2KI:4:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Bed,</i> esteeming it as a relic, (Haydock) or wishing to excite the man of God to pray for her child, and to conceal its death from her husband. (Menochius)'
      v:023:
        - "2KI:4:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Moon,</i> a day of devotion, (Numbers x. 10.; Calmet) or probably of obligation, like the <i>sabbath,</i> on which no long journey could be undertaken, (Tirinus; ver. 8.) unless for the sake of piety, (Exodus xxvi. 8.) as Sunam is a place six or seven leagues, (Calmet) or eight hours' walk from Carmel. (Adrichomius) (Menochius) --- Piety was not so far decayed in Israel but many fervent souls still went to hear the prophets. (Calmet) It seems this woman had often made such journeys. (Menochius) --- <i>Go.</i> Hebrew, \"peace.\" Protestants, \"<i>it shall be</i> well:\" let me depart. She is unwilling to reveal the reason of her journey; but her husband was so well convinced of her virtue, that he placed no obstacle in her way. Perhaps he might partly guess what was the matter, as he had sent the child home sick, and saw his wife so desirous to visit the prophet. (Haydock)"
      v:024:
        - '2KI:4:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>And do.</i> Hebrew, "unless I bid thee." Some translate, "urge me not to get up, unless," &c. (Chaldean; Arabic, &c.) They suppose that she went on foot, and that the ass was designed for Eliseus. (Vatable)'
      v:026:
        - '2KI:4:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Well.</i> She declines mentioning what she wanted to the servant, in order that she might speak to the prophet in person. (Menochius) --- She might also rationally hope that the child was <i>well</i> in another world. (Haydock)'
      v:027:
        - '2KI:4:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Her.</i> Being aware of the extreme circumspection and modesty of his master. --- <i>Told me.</i> Hence it appears that the prophets were not inspired at all times, 2 Kings vii. 3, "that they might be sensible that what they had was a gift of God." (St. Gregory, hom. in 11 Ezech.)'
      v:028:
        - '2KI:4:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>A son.</i> Better had it been for me not to have become a mother, than to be so soon delivered of my child. (Menochius)'
      v:029:
        - '2KI:4:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Salute him not.</i> He that is sent to raise to life the sinner spiritually dead, must not suffer himself to be called off, or diverted from his enterprise, by the salutations or ceremonies of the world. (Challoner) --- So must the preachers of the gospel diligently fulfil their important office, Luke x. 4. (St. Gregory, hom. 17.) Urbanity is not reprehended; but no human transaction ought to impede what is divine. (St. Ambrose, ibid.[Luke x. 4.?]) In ancient comedies, slaves are always represented in a hurry. The Jews will not salute any person when they are going to their synagogues, for fear of being distracted in their devotions. (Calmet) --- Eliseus requires the utmost expedition, that the favour might be the greater, <i>Qui cito dat, bis dat.</i> (Menochius) --- He would also prevent his servant from telling any one what he was about, that he might not be touched with vanity, and thus hinder the miracle, which some think was nevertheless the case. (R. Salomon) (Theodoret, q. 17.) (Tirinus)'
      v:031:
        - "2KI:4:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>The child is not risen.</i> By the staff of Eliseus is represented the rod of Moses, or the old law, which was incapable of restoring life to mankind, then dead by sin. It was necessary that Christ himself should come in our flesh, to restore us to life again. In this, Eliseus, as a figure of Christ, behoved to go in person to restore the dead child to life. (Challoner) --- St. Augustine (contra Faust. xii. 35.) shews that many like things recorded in the Old Testament are figures of the New. (Worthington) --- Many of the fathers observe, that this miracle was intended to shew the necessity of the Incarnation to redeem lost man. The staff did not therefore restore life. Some lay the blame on Giezi; others on the woman, who required the prophet to come in person; and others suppose that Eliseus followed herein his own spirit. But all this is destitute of proof. (Calmet) --- He might alter his mind (Tirinus) at the request of the woman, and to imitate Elias; (3 Kings xvii. 21.) all by God's direction. (Haydock) --- He had before trusted that God would perform the miracle by means of the staff, as he did formerly by the rod of Moses, or by the mantle of Elias. (Menochius)"

        - '2KI:4:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Warm.</i> Arabic adds, "by his breath," as when God breathed a soul into Adam. (Theodoret, q. 18.) --- Some Greek interpreters have, "he breathed upon him," &c.'
      v:035:
        - '2KI:4:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Upon him.</i> Septuagint, "he breathed," &c. (Calmet) --- Other copies, (Alexandrian and Vatican) "he bent down upon the child seven times, and the child opened his eyes." --- <i>Gaped.</i> Protestants, "sneezed;" (Haydock) in which interpretation, Junius, Montanus, &c., agree. Arabic, "he turned his eyes about seven times." Others, "he trembled," (Calmet) or sighed; (ver. 19.) and sneezing is accounted good for alleviating the pain. <i>Sternutamenta capitis gravedinem emendant.</i> (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxviii. 6.) (Calmet)'

(Calmet) --- <i>To one,</i> &c. Hebrew and Septuagint, "to his servant," Giezi. (Menochius) --- Eliseus provided for the temporal as well as for the spiritual wants of his followers. (Haydock) --- The famine had been sent by God, to punish the idolatry of the people, chap. viii. 1. (Menochius)'

        - '2KI:4:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Wild herbs.</i> Hebrew <i>oroth.</i> Septuagint {GREEK:START arioth}αριοθ{GREEK:END}, may denote any thing that could be "gathered." --- <i>Gourds: colocynthides.</i> They resembled cucumbers; but were so bitter, that they were styled, "the gall of the earth." Vallesius, (Phil. c. 36.) who observes, that a small quantity may cause death, (c. 37.) and that the remedy used by the prophet was supernatural; though Lemnius (c. 7.) asserts, that the mixture of barley-flour would take away the bitterness. (Tirinus) --- It has, in effect, that tendency; but the hand of God must still be acknowledged. (Calmet)'

      v:001: '2KI:4:1 | 1 | 1 | Now a certain woman of the wives of the prophets, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}cried to Eliseus, saying: Thy servant, my husband, is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant was one that feared God, and behold the creditor is come to take away my two sons to serve him.'
      v:002: '2KI:4:2 | 2 | 2 | And Eliseus said to her: What wilt thou have me to do for thee? Tell me, what hast thou in thy house? And she answered: I, thy handmaid, have nothing in my house but a little oil, to anoint me.'
      v:003: '2KI:4:3 | 3 | 3 | And he said to her: Go, borrow of all thy neighbours empty vessels, not a few.'
      v:004: '2KI:4:4 | 4 | 4 | And go in, and shut thy door, when thou art within, and thy sons: and pour out thereof into all those vessels: and when they are full, take them away.'
      v:005: '2KI:4:5 | 5 | 5 | So the woman went, and shut the door upon her, and upon her sons: they brought her the vessels, and she poured in.'
      v:006: '2KI:4:6 | 6 | 6 | And when the vessels were full, she said to her son: Bring me yet a vessel. And he answered: I have no more. And the oil stood.'
      v:007: '2KI:4:7 | 7 | 7 | And she came, and told the man of God. And he said: Go, sell the oil, and pay thy creditor: and thou and thy sons live of the rest.'
      v:008: '2KI:4:8 | 8 | 8 | And there was a day when Eliseus passed by Sunam: now there was a great woman there, who detained him to eat bread: and as he passed often that way, he turned into her house to eat bread.'
      v:009: '2KI:4:9 | 9 | 9 | And she said to her husband: I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who often passeth by us.'
      v:010: '2KI:4:10 | 10 | 10 | Let us, therefore, make him a little chamber, and put a little bed in it for him, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick, that when he cometh to us he may abide there.'
      v:011: '2KI:4:11 | 11 | 11 | Now, there was a certain day, when he came, and turned into the chamber, and rested there.'
      v:012: '2KI:4:12 | 12 | 12 | And he said to Giezi, his servant: Call this Sunamitess. And when he had called her, and she stood before him,'
      v:013: '2KI:4:13 | 13 | 13 | He said to his servant: Say to her: Behold, thou hast diligently served us in all things; what wilt thou have me to do for thee? Hast thou any business, and wilt thou, that I speak to the king, or to the general of the army? And she answered: I dwell in the midst of my own people.'
      v:014: '2KI:4:14 | 14 | 14 | And he said: What will she then that I do for her? And Giezi said: Do not ask, for she hath no son, and her husband is old.'
      v:015: '2KI:4:15 | 15 | 15 | Then he bid him call her. And when she was called, and stood before the door,'
      v:016: '2KI:4:16 | 16 | 16 | He said to her: At this time, and this same hour, if life be in company, thou shalt have a son in thy womb. But she answered: Do not, I beseech thee, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.'
      v:017: '2KI:4:17 | 17 | 17 | And the woman conceived, and brought forth a son in the time, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and at the same hour that Eliseus had said.'
      v:018: '2KI:4:18 | 18 | 18 | And the child grew. And on a certain day, when he went out to his father to the reapers,'
      v:019: '2KI:4:19 | 19 | 19 | He said to his father: My head acheth, my head acheth. But he said to his servant: Take him and carry him to his mother.'
      v:020: '2KI:4:20 | 20 | 20 | And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, she sat him on her knees, until noon, and then he died.'
      v:021: '2KI:4:21 | 21 | 21 | And she went up, and laid him upon the bed of the man of God, and shut the door: and going out,'
      v:022: '2KI:4:22 | 22 | 22 | She called her husband, and said: Send with me, I beseech thee, one of thy servants, and an ass, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.'
      v:023: '2KI:4:23 | 23 | 23 | And he said to her: Why dost thou go to him? to-day is neither new moon nor sabbath. She answered: I will go.'
      v:024: '2KI:4:24 | 24 | 24 | And she saddled an ass, and commanded her servant: Drive, and make haste, make no stay in going: And do that which I bid thee.'
      v:025: '2KI:4:25 | 25 | 25 | So she went forward, and came to the man of God, to Mount Carmel: and when the mall of God saw her coming towards, he said to Giezi, his servant: Behold that Sunamitess.'
      v:026: '2KI:4:26 | 26 | 26 | Go, therefore, to meet her, and say to her: Is all well with thee, and with thy husband, and with thy son? And she answered: Well.'
      v:027: '2KI:4:27 | 27 | 27 | And when she came to the man of God, to the mount, she caught hold on his feet: and Giezi came to remove her. And the man of God said: Let her alone, for her soul is in anguish, and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.'
      v:028: '2KI:4:28 | 28 | 28 | And she said to him: Did I ask a son of my lord? did I not say to thee: Do not deceive me?'
      v:029: '2KI:4:29 | 29 | 29 | Then he said to Giezi: Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go. If any man meet thee, salute him not: and if any man salute thee, answer him not: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.'
      v:030: '2KI:4:30 | 30 | 30 | But the mother of the child said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. He arose, therefore, and followed her.'
      v:031: '2KI:4:31 | 31 | 31 | But Giezi was gone before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child, and there was no voice nor sense: and he returned to meet him, and told him, saying: The child is not risen.'
      v:032: '2KI:4:32 | 32 | 32 | Eliseus, therefore, went into the house, and behold the child lay dead on his bed:'
      v:033: '2KI:4:33 | 33 | 33 | And going in, he shut the door upon him, and upon the child, and prayed to the Lord.'
      v:034: "2KI:4:34 | 34 | 34 | And he went up, and lay upon the child: and he put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he bowed himself upon him, and the child's flesh grew warm."
      v:035: '2KI:4:35 | 35 | 35 | Then he returned and walked in the house, once to and fro: and he went up, and lay upon him: and the child gaped seven times, and opened his eyes.'
      v:036: '2KI:4:36 | 36 | 36 | And he called Giezi, and said to him: Call this Sunamitess. And she being called, went in to him: and he said: Take up thy son.'
      v:037: '2KI:4:37 | 37 | 37 | She came and fell at his feet, and worshipped upon the ground: and took up her son, and went out.'
      v:038: '2KI:4:38 | 38 | 38 | And Eliseus returned to Galgal, and there was a famine in the land, and the sons of the prophets dwelt before him: And he said to one of his servants: Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.'
      v:039: '2KI:4:39 | 39 | 39 | And one went out into the field to gather wild herbs: and he found something like a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds of the field, and filled his mantle, and coming back, he shred them into the pot of pottage; for he knew not what it was.'
      v:040: '2KI:4:40 | 40 | 40 | And they poured it out for their companions to eat: and when they had tasted of the pottage, they cried out, saying: Death is in the pot, O man of God. And they could not eat thereof.'
      v:041: '2KI:4:41 | 41 | 41 | But he said: Bring some meal. And when they had brought it, he cast it into the pot, and said: Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was now no bitterness in the pot.'
      v:042: '2KI:4:42 | 42 | 42 | And a certain man came from Baalsalisa, bringing to the man of God, bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and new corn in his scrip. And he said: Give to the people, that they may eat.'
      v:043: '2KI:4:43 | 43 | 43 | And his servant answered him: How much is this, that I should set it before a hundred men? He said again: Give to the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the Lord: They shall eat, and there shall be left.'
      v:044: '2KI:4:44 | 44 | 44 | So he set it before them: and they ate, and there was left, according to the word of the Lord.'

        - '2KI:5:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>King,</i> Benadad, who had defeated Achab, and was slain by Hazael; (chap. viii.; Tirinus) or, according to Salien, Hazael was already king. (Menochius) --- Josephus passes over this history. It is not known for what reason, (Calmet) unless he was staggered at the petition of Naaman, ver. 18, 19. (Haydock) --- <i>Syria.</i> The Rabbins say, by killing Achab, 3 Kings xxii. 34. But their authority is very small; (Haydock) and he might signalize himself on many other occasions. --- <i>Leper.</i> This malady did not exclude him from court. The Hebrews allowed such to appear in public, till the priests had declared them unclean; and other nations viewed the leprosy with less horror.'
      v:002:
        - '2KI:5:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Robbers;</i> soldiers. (Tirinus) (2 Kings iv. 2.) --- Such invaded the dominions of Joachin, chap. xxiv. 2. Irruptions of this nature were then very common, (see Judges xi. 3., and Job i. 15.) and regarded as noble military exploits. When the Greeks first became acquainted with navigation, they exercised themselves in this manner; (Thucydides l.) and the Germans allowed their citizens to take from other people. <i>Juventutis exercendæ ac desidiæ minuendæ causa.</i> (Cæsar, Bel. Gal. vi.) Those who had been plundered, were allowed to redeem their goods. (Strabo xi.) --- The Arabs still maintain their right to live upon their neighbours. (Calmet) --- The Christian religion has introduced more gentle manners. --- <i>Maid.</i> It seems, however, she was well informed of the miraculous powers and goodness of Eliseus. (Haydock)'

      v:010:
        - "2KI:5:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Messenger.</i> Eliseus supports the dignity of God's envoy, and shews the general that his cure was to be attributed, not to the presence of the prophet, but to the will and goodness of God."
      v:012:
        - '2KI:5:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Pharphar.</i> Benjamin (p. 53) informs us that the former river serves to water the city, and the second the surrounding gardens. Maundrell could discover no vestiges of these names in Syria, but he describes the Barrady, which supplies Damascus with abundance of water. Stephanus calls it <i>Bardine;</i> and others, the Chrysorroas. The Orontes, which is supposed to be one of these rivers, flows by Antioch into the Mediterranean sea. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - '2KI:5:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Father;</i> a title given to masters, kings, &c. The Romans senators were styled, "conscript fathers;" and Homer calls kings "the fathers and shepherds of the people." See Genesis xlv. 8. (Calmet) --- Masters may often derive benefit from the observations of their servants, as Naaman did repeatedly, ver. 2. This may serve to correct their pride. (Haydock) --- <i>Clean.</i> The patient ought not to prescribe rules to his physician. (Menochius) --- How justly might these words be addressed to delicate penitents! (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - '2KI:5:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Clean.</i> If bathing seven times in the Jordan had been an infallible remedy, there would soon have been no lepers in the land; and our Saviour plainly intimates that the cure was miraculous, Luke iv. 27. The leprosy of Naaman, though inveterate, was cured in an instant. To bathe in a rapid stream, is allowed to be very salutary for removing the diseases of the skin. (Calmet) (Vales. 38.) --- The fathers discover in this miracle, a figure of the Gentiles called to the faith by the Synagogue, which is in servitude, Galatians iv. 25. Baptism cleanses us from all the seven capital sins, (Tertullian, contra Marc. 4.) so that no vestiges remain. (St. Ambrose, &c.) (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - "2KI:5:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>A blessing.</i> A present, (Challoner) accompanied with wishes of happiness, on both sides. We have seen that the prophets generally received such presents. But Eliseus acts with more reserve in regard of this stranger, as St. Paul did towards the new converts; though he received some sustenance from those, who would be less in danger of suspecting that he was actuated by selfish views in preaching the gospel, 2 Corinthians x. 7., and xii. 14., and Matthew x. 8. (Calmet) --- They abstained from every appearance of evil, (Haydock) though they might lawfully have accepted such presents. Eliseus wished to convince Naaman that God's grace was not to be purchased, and to leave a lesson of moderation to future teachers. (Menochius)"
      v:017:
        - '2KI:5:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Mule;</i> (<i>burdonum,</i>) the offspring of a horse and of an ass. (Menochius) --- <i>Earth,</i> to make brick for an altar, or to inclose within a box of brass, as was done in the altar of holocausts in the desert; or, in fine, to sprinkle on some clean place, where an altar might be erected, in honour of the true God. He does not inquire what ceremonies were used in the land of Israel, (Calmet) as he was not enrolled by circumcision, among the Hebrews, as an observer of their law; but intended to serve God, like Job, and many other righteous Gentiles, who kept themselves clear of idolatry, and observed the ancient patriarchal religion with a clean heart. (Haydock) --- As God had sanctified the land by the observance of his true religion, Naaman rightly judged that it was fitter for an altar than the earth of his own country. (Worthington) --- The Jews had a particular veneration for it, Psalm ci. 15. They built a synagogue in Persia, with earth and stones taken from Jerusalem. (Benjamin) --- Christians sometimes carry away the same earth. (St. Augustine, de C.[City of God?] xxii. 8.) (Turon. i. 7.) --- The Donatists had a sovereign respect for it; (St. Augustine, ep. 52.) and it is said that St. Helena brought a great quantity to the church of the Holy Cross of Jerusalem, at Rome. (Mabillon, Itin. p. 187.) (Calmet) --- <i>Lord.</i> Out of Palestine, the Gentiles were not prohibited to offer sacrifice to the true God any where; nor were they under any obligation of following the law of Moses. (Abulensis) (Tirinus)'
      v:018:
        - '2KI:5:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Remmon,</i> denotes "a pomegranate," or something "elevated," and is probably an epithet of the sun, the chief idol of the Syrians, which was also styled Adad, "one," as both are united, Zacharias xii. 11. --- <i>Rempham</i> is probably the same divinity, Acts vii. 43. Septuagint here read, Remman. Hesychius explains Ramas, "the highest god." Selden thinks the <i>Elion</i> of the Phœnicians is understood; Grotius, that Saturn, the highest of the planets, is meant. Serarius declares for Venus, to whom pomegranates were sacred; and P. Martyr for Juno, who held one of these apples in her hand. (Pausan. in Corinth) --- Remmon occurs no where else. --- <i>Hand.</i> This was an honour of the chief favourite, chap. vii. 2. (Calmet) --- <i>Thing.</i> He does not ask leave to commit sin, which would be absurd; though Protestants are not ashamed to accuse the Catholic Church, as if her "indulgences" were pardons for sins to come; though they be in reality no pardon for sin at all, but only a remission of temporal punishment, after the sin has been remitted by penance. Why do they not manfully attack what we really profess to believe? --- <i>When he.</i> Hebrew, "when I bow," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - "2KI:5:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Go in peace.</i> What the prophet here allowed, was not an outward conformity to an idolatrous worship, but only a service which by his office he owed to his master; who, on all public occasions, leaned on him: so that his bowing down when his master bowed himself down, was not in effect adoring the idols; nor was it so understood by the standers by, (since he publicly professed himself a worshipper of the only true and living God) but it was no more than doing a civil office to the king, his master, whose leaning upon him obliged him to bow at the same time that he bowed. (Challoner) --- Some assert that the prophet does not even authorize this civil assistance in the temple of idols, but simply tells Naaman to go in peace, and to think no more of his former religion; that he will beseech the Lord not to suffer him to be exposed to the danger. (Junius and Piscator) (Calmet) --- Some formerly pleaded this example, to excuse their occasional conformity in going to the Protestant churches, as the law required. But the case was very different. Greater perfection is required in the new law. They had not to act in the capacity of Naaman; and their attendance was considered as a profession of a false religion. Their directors loudly condemned the practice. They ought rather to have imitated Eleazar, &c., who refused to eat swine's flesh, 2 Machabees vi., and vii. (Worthington) --- Though the king intended to adore the idol, Naaman referred his worship to God alone. (Bristow, Mot. 23.; Theodoret, q. 19.; and a Greek interpreter.) --- The Hebrew term signifies, either to adore mentally, or to bend down; which latter is the sense applicable to Naaman. (Cajetan) (Amama) --- His \"request must certainly refer to the time past, and not to that to come; as if he begged an indulgence in idolatry, or of countenancing his master's idol-worship, by his presence.\" (Button, Dict.) --- The Jews foolishly pretend (Calmet) that \"the proselyte of dwelling,\" like Naaman, might return to the service of idols, in his own country, without its being imputed to him. (Selden, Jur. ii. 11.) (Maimonides) --- The conduct of the Syrian convert, whether past or future, undoubtedly filled him with alarm. If he considered the danger of a merely civil attendance upon the king, in an idolatrous temple, we cannot condemn him of idle scrupulosity; (Haycock) since many have found a difficulty in admitting the lawfulness of such a practice, and have even blamed both Naaman and the prophet. (Greg. de Valentia, &c., ep. Cornelius a Lapide) (Calmet) --- But if the practice was irreprehensible, as most interpreters assert, the answer of Eliseus might give this assurance to Naaman, and inform him that he need be under no farther apprehension on that account. <i>Go in peace.</i> These words do not expressly solve the difficulty; but the mode in which they were uttered might intimate, either that the general would be no longer under that embarrassment, (as we do not read that he ever attended the king of Syria into the temple afterwards) or that God had forgiven his former offences, and particularly the scandalous idolatry which now gave him so much pain. The original, ver. 18, which is generally translated in the present or future, (Haydock) may be better rendered in the past tense, as the Chaldean has it. \"In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant. My master going into the temple of Remmon to worship there, and leaning upon my hand, and I worshipped in the temple of Remmon, when <i>I</i> did worship in the temple of Remmon, that the Lord pardon,\" &c. St. Jerome and the Septuagint seem to have read more correctly, <i>when he,</i> &c. We may also render it in the present tense, \"and I worship,\" or, \"am wont to adore;\" not that he meant to prevaricate any longer. The Syriac and Arabic read with an interrogation. \"When I shall adore....(Calmet; or bow down, Haydock) will the Lord pardon me?\" But this rather increases the difficulty. (Calmet) --- We may therefore conclude either that Naaman had no decision, or that he had leave to serve his master, (Haydock) in a civil capacity even in the temple; (Menochius; Tirinus; Alex. 2. dis. 7.; Santius, &c.) or, that he obtained pardon for his past transgressions. (Bochart; Calmet, &c.) --- <i>Earth,</i> as the expression is rendered [in] Genesis xxxv. 16., thoug here it is literally, \"at the chosen season;\" <i>electo,</i> not <i>verno.</i> The sense is the same. <i>Cibrath,</i> untranslated by the Septuagint, may denote a certain space, or village; (Haydock) \"a furrow,\" of 240 feet long, and half that breadth; (Calmet) \"a mile;\" (Chaldean; Pagnin) or a portion of time allowed by the law, about a quarter of an hour, during which a mile, or sabbath-day's journey, might be performed. (Tirinus) --- Protestants, \"a little way.\""

(Calmet) --- He had pretended a reluctance to take more than one talent, not to swerve from his master's injunctions. (Menochius)"

Eliseus would hardly dismiss the Syrians, when the night was so near at hand. (Calmet) --- It might however be found more eligible to travel in the evening, (Haydock) as it was now the spring or summer season, (Tirinus) or at least warm, ver. 10. (Haydock)'

      v:027:
        - '2KI:5:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>For ever.</i> Not perhaps to those who might be already born, unless they were accomplices in the crime. The leprosy is hereditary. Giezi was punished for simony, in selling the miracle, as well as for lying and disobedience. (Calmet) --- He might also have given occasion to Naaman to judge ill of his master; as the false prophets were noted for such avarice, Micheas iii. 11. But Eliseus would probably take care to give him better information. (Tirinus) --- He did not require his servant to give up what he had unjustly received, as the general had made over the property to him; and he thought proper to leave it in the hands of Giezi, to indemnify him for past services, and that he might have wherewith to support himself, as he now dismissed him from his company. (Salien, the year before Christ 903.) --- <i>Snow,</i> and therefore more incurable. (Tirinus) --- See Leviticus xiii. (Calmet) --- "All the covetous and misers, together with their riches, possess the leprosy of Giezi:" <i>thesaurum criminum congregarunt.</i> (St. Ambrose) Giezi prefigured Judas, the false apostle of Christ, and all those who buy or sell spiritual things. By their avarice, they procure infamy in this world, and damnation in the next. (St. Augustine, ep. 208, de Temp.) (Worthington)'

      v:008: '2KI:5:8 | 8 | 8 | And when Eliseus, the man of God, had heard this, to wit, that the king of Israel had rent his garments, he sent to him, saying: Why hast thou rent thy garments? let him come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel.'

The Fathers here remark a figure of the cross of Jesus Christ; the virtue of which, in baptism, reclaims the hardened sinner from the ways of vanity. (Tertullian, contra Judæos xiii.) (Calmet) --- Those who would explain the reason of every miracle, may here inform the infidel why recourse was had to a supernatural interference, in a matter apparently of such a trifling nature. They ask why God should cause the eyes of various pictures in Italy to <i>move</i> on a late occasion; and because they cannot assign a satisfactory reason, they boldly assert that all was an imposture. But this mode of argumentation is very delusive, if not impious. \"<i>Who hath been his</i> (<i>God's</i>) <i>counsellor?</i>\" (Romans xi. 34.)

      v:018:
        - "2KI:6:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Blindness.</i> The blindness here spoken of was of a particular kind, which hindered them from seeing the objects that were really before them; and represented other different objects to their imagination; so that they no longer perceived the city of Dothan, nor were able to know the person of Eliseus; but were easily led by him, whom they took to be another man, to Samaria. So that he truly told them; <i>this is not the way, neither is this the city,</i> &c., because he spoke with relation to <i>the way,</i> and to <i>the city</i> which was represented to them. (Challoner) --- Stratagems in war are lawful. (St. Chrysostom, &c.) (Grotius, Jur. iii. 1, 17.) The words of the prophet might be merely ironical. --- <i>Blindness,</i> Septuagint {GREEK:START aorasia}αορασια{GREEK:END}, \"not seeing\" certain objects, while they could perceive others; as was the case of the men who sought Lot's door at Sodom; (Genesis xix. 11.; Calmet) and the eyes of the disciples were held, that they might not know our Saviour. Eliseus had left his house, going towards Samaria to meet the soldiers; and when they asked him where the prophet dwelt, he answered truly, <i>This,</i> &c. For he was then near the royal city, and his abode was at Dothan. (Salien) (Haydock) --- The reprobate will thus acknowledge their error, when it is too late, at the last day."

(Haydock) --- Lyranus supposes that the whole ass was sold for about 38 crowns, (Haydock) or 130 livres; as we say commonly, \"so much a head.\" But interpreters generally assert that the price of the head alone is given; which shews more forcibly the greatness of the famine. On other occasions the animal could not be eaten by the Jews. Artaxerxes was forced to kill his beasts of burden; and an ass's head was then sold for 60 drachms, or 25 livres. When Hannibal besieged Casilinum, a mouse (or rat) was sold for above 70, or for 200 denarii. (Pliny, [Natural History?] viii. 57.) (V.

Those who suppose that the Samaritans bought the dung of pigeons to use as salt or for food, or to burn, or to manure the earth, &c., produce not satisfactory reasons; no more than the Rabbins, who pretend that the corn which they had picked up was taken from their crop. (Tr. Megil. 3., and the Scholastic History.) Junius and Fuller would translate \"belly,\" which is refuted by Bochart. (Anim. T. ii. B. i. 7.) Very disgusting things have often been used through extreme hunger, (Grotius) and some sort of birds' dung is said to fatten oxen and swine. (Varro 38.; Pliny xvii. 9.) --- But what nutriment can there be in that of pigeons, that people should go to buy it? (Calmet) --- Houbigant understands a sort of peas to be meant.

      v:011: '2KI:6:11 | 11 | 11 | And the heart of the king of Syria, was troubled for this thing. And calling together his servants, he said: Why do you not tell me who it is that betrays me to the king of Israel?'
      v:012: '2KI:6:12 | 12 | 12 | And one of his servants said: No one, my lord, O king: but Eliseus, the prophet, that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel all the words, that thou speakest in thy privy chamber.'
      v:013: '2KI:6:13 | 13 | 13 | And he said to them: Go, and see where he is: that I may send and take him. And they told him: saying: Behold he is in Dothan.'

      v:021: '2KI:6:21 | 21 | 21 | And the king of Israel said to Eliseus, when he saw them: My father, shall I kill them?'
      v:022: '2KI:6:22 | 22 | 22 | And he said: Thou shalt not kill them: for thou didst not take them with thy sword, or thy bow, that thou mayst kill them: but set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.'
      v:023: '2KI:6:23 | 23 | 23 | And a great provision of meats was set before them, and they ate and drank; and he let them go: and they went away to their master: and the robbers of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.'

(Calmet) --- <i>Flood-gates.</i> If corn should fall with the same abundance as water does from the cataracts of the Nile; or, Hebrew, "if the Lord should make windows," &c., to pour it down, (Calmet) could it possibly be so cheap? (Menochius) --- <i>Thereof.</i> Thus his incredulity was punished, ver. 17. (Salien) --- Reason must not pretend to reach the power of God, but ought to believe what he says. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - '2KI:7:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Lepers.</i> They were excluded from society, though the laws of religion were ill observed in Israel. The Rabbins say, these four were Giezi and his three sons. (Calmet) --- But this is without foundation, (Haydock) as Giezi was not yet a leper, chap. viii. 5. --- Salien places that judgment two years later. (Haydock)'

(Calmet) --- See Jeremias ii. 10. (Menochius) --- These Hethites seem to have dwelt in the stony Arabia, (Judges i. 26.) or in Syria. (Haydock) --- Solomon had connexions with them, 3 Kings x. 29. (Calmet) --- Angels made <i>the noise</i> of a mighty army, and probably appeared, as they had done to Giezi, chap. vi. 17. (Tirinus)'
      v:009:

      v:013:
        - '2KI:7:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Consumed,</i> for food. (Menochius) --- Septuagint, "Let them take five of the horses left. Those which are left here, behold they are to all the remaining multitude of Israel, and let us send them." They have read in a different manner from the present Hebrew, which has, "Let them take five of the horses there remaining; behold they are like all the multitude of Israel which is left; they are like all the multitude of Israel who are lost; let us send them." Arabic, "Let us send thither five horsemen who remain; if they escape, we shall look upon them as those Israelites who continue alive; if they perish, they well be numbered with the other Israelites who are dead." Both horses and horsemen were dreadfully lean, and they could not expect a better fate than those already consumed by famine. (Calmet) --- The truth of the report ought at least to be fully ascertained. By following the timid advice of the king no prospect of redress appeared. At last the king consented to send two horsemen. (Haydock) (Septuagint, ver. 14.) (Junius, &c.)'

      v:006: '2KI:7:6 | 6 | 6 | For the Lord had made them hear, in the camp of Syria, the noise of chariots, and of horses, and of a very great army: and they said one to another: Behold, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hethites, and of the Egyptians; and they are come upon us.'
      v:007: '2KI:7:7 | 7 | 7 | Wherefore they arose, and fled away in the dark, and left their tents, and their horses and asses in the camp, and fled, desiring to save their lives.'

      v:013: '2KI:7:13 | 13 | 13 | And one of his servants answered: Let us take the five horses that are remaining in the city (because there are no more in the whole multitude of Israel, for the rest are consumed), and let us send and see.'

        - '2KI:8:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Famine.</i> God disposes of all things. (Calmet) --- Famine, &c., are his executioners. (Du Hamel) --- This dreadful visitation took place before the siege of Samaria, (Salien) and had even commenced when Eliseus raise the child to life; (chap. iv. 38.) so that we might translate, "Eliseus had spoken," &c.

(Calmet) --- This he would more readily do, if Giezi had brought the glad tidings of plenty.

      v:010:
        - "2KI:8:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Tell him: Thou shalt recover.</i> By these words the prophet signified that the king's disease was not mortal: and that he would recover, if no violence were used. Or he might only express himself in this manner, by way of giving Hazael to understand that he knew both what he would say and do; that he would indeed tell the king he should recover, but would be himself the instrument of his death. (Challoner) -- The imperative is often used for the future tense. (Gloss iii. 3.) (John ii. 19.) The present Hebrew reads, \"Thou shalt not live: for,\" &c., which removes the difficulty. But the Chaldean, Septuagint, Syriac, &c., agree with the Vulgate, (Calmet) as the Protestant version also does. \"Thou mayst certainly recover, howbeit the Lord,\" &c. (Haydock) --- <i>Lo,</i> \"not,\" in the Hebrew text, seems however preferable to the marginal reading, <i>lu,</i> \"to him.\" This mistake has been sometimes made elsewhere, and ought to be carefully examined.

Though this has the appearance of a gloss, it is perhaps most conformable to the Hebrew and to an ancient Greek version.

        - "2KI:8:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Blanket.</i> Hebrew <i>macber,</i> a word which the Septuagint retain. (Haydock) --- It denotes a hairy coverlet, pillow, &c. Tiberius and Frederic II met with the like fate. (Calmet) --- some think that Hazael was only guilty of imprudence; (Menochius) or that Benadad killed himself; as the Hebrew might be rendered, if the sequel did not evince that his death was caused by Hazael's malice. (Calmet) --- He might pretend that the wet cloth would give Benadad refreshment. (Haydock) --- But it would bring on present death, with most exquisite torture. (Tirinus) --- The names of both these kings were in great veneration among the Syrians, who paid them divine honours. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] ix. 4.) --- Perhaps they might not know that the latter had been guilty of such a base murder. (Haydock)"

Hebrew, "He rose....and attacked Edom that surrounded him, (with superior numbers) and the princes... and the people (of Israel) fled." But the text will also bear the sense of the Vulgate, which is conformable to 2 Paralipomenon xxi. 9., which does not say <i>the people,</i> &c., though these words may be understood of the Edomites. Joram could not derive such advantage from his victory, as to reduce the nation under his obedience. (Calmet)'

It was a strong place assigned to the priests; but strangers had probably again taken possession of it, and caused it now to revolt. The kings of Juda had retaken it when Sennacherib laid siege to the place. See chap. xix. 8., and Josue x. 30., and xxi. 13.'

All the original versions, and many copies of the Septuagint read \"twenty-two\" in both passages; and those who would admit no mistake, are forced to have recourse to explanations which can give no satisfaction. De Dieu would include in the reign of Ochozias the six years of Athalia's usurpation, and the thirteen of Joas, during his minority. Others would date from the separation of the two kingdoms, &c. But would the Holy Ghost cause the same fact to be recorded in two places in such a different manner? The best chronologists acknowledge a mistake in the Hebrew text of Paralipomenon. (Cajetan; Salien; Petau; Tirinus, &c.; Calmet) as the letters which denote these numbers are not unlike (Mariana:) <i>c</i> (20) might easily be exchanged for <i>m</i> (40.)

Warriors are but too apt to give way to sentiments of irreligion, (Menochius) and to despise men who lead a retired and penitential life. (Haydock) --- How often were Ezechiel and Jeremias treated as fools, (Ezechiel xxxiii. 30., and Jeremias xxix. 26.; Calmet) as well as our divine Saviour? The pagans looked upon those who were inspired by Apollo in the same light. (Haydock) --- <i>Ut primum cessit furor & rabida ora quierunt,</i> Virgil, Æneid vi.

If (Calmet) Jezabel thought that she would thus command respect or love, (Abulensis) she was extremely imprudent and rash, in her present condition. Pride might suggest that she ought not to appear unadorned. (Calmet) (Tirinus) --- The women of the Eastern countries delight much in painting, (Pliny, [Natural History?] xi. 37., and xxxiii. 6.) and some men have not been ashamed to follow their example. (St. Cyprian) --- Sardanapalus had his eyes and his eye-lids painted. (Atheneus xii.) The Arabs, &c., think that this black colour protects the eyes against the sun-beams. (Valle ii. Ep. 17.) To express the affection of Jezabel, Hebrew has, "she placed her eyes in antimony," (<i>fuc,</i> or <i>puc,</i> whence the Latin <i>fucus</i> is visibly derived) as if she plunged them in it.

(Calmet) --- Her body cannot be recognized. This will be the fate of the greatest mortal beauties, a few days after their departure. St. Francis Borgia durst not take an oath that the corpse which he had to attend, was that of the late beautiful empress Isabella: so much was it already disfigured. This sight was the beginning of his conversion, and of that eminent sanctity to which he attained, by despising all that the world can give or take away. (Haydock) --- The Spanish interpreters call Achab's widow, Isabella: and she seems to have been the sister, or relation, of Dido, who founded Carthage about this time; (Tirinus) Salien says in the 16th year of Jehu, the year before Christ 887.

The king's children were perhaps educated in the most noble families, (ver. 6.) and in the best cities, 2 Paralipomenon xi. 23.

        - '2KI:10:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Jonadab,</i> a holy personage, Jeremias xxxv. 6. The Rechabites were a sort of religious, descended from Jethro and the Cinites. (Calmet) --- They dwelt in the country, and fed sheep, &c., Numbers x. 29. (Tirinus) --- John of Jerus.[Jerusalem?] (c. 25.) says that Jonadab was a disciple of Eliseus, and followed his institute in all things, except continency. (Menochius) --- <i>Blessed him,</i> wishing his peace and prosperity. (Menochius) --- It is not clear whether Jehu or Jonadab pronounced this blessing. (Haydock) --- <i>Heart.</i> Art thou friendly to my cause? --- <i>Thy hand,</i> in sign of concord, and to help him up into his chariot. (Calmet) --- It was of great consequence to obtain the approbation of a man (Haydock) who must have been so revered by the people. (Menochius) --- Jehu acted with the utmost policy. (Haydock)'
      v:018:
        - '2KI:10:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>I will worship him more.</i> Jehu sinned in thus pretending to worship Baal, and causing sacrifices to be offered to him: because evil in not to be done, that good may come of it, Romans iii. 8. (Challoner) (Worthington) --- St. Jerome, &c., excuse him from mortal sin, as his intention was good. (Tirinus) --- If he had not thus dissembled, he could not have so effectually destroyed the adorers of Baal, who would have concealed themselves. But God rewarded his zeal, and not his falsehood. (Calmet) --- He might speak ironically; though Theodoret, &c., admit a lie. (Menochius)'

        - '2KI:10:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Other.</i> Literally, "from top to top." Hebrew, "from mouth to mouth," (Haydock) like a vessel brimfull. (Calmet) --- Every corner was filled. All the priests and prophets made their appearance, through zeal to re-establish the honour of their idol, and for fear of death. (Menochius)'
      v:022:
        - '2KI:10:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Wardrobe,</i> of vestments used in the service of Baal. The worship chiefly consisted in such outward pomp. The priests were probably adorned like those at the pillars of Hercules, who were from the same country. Sil. Ital. iii., <i>velantur corpora lino, &c.</i>'
      v:024:
        - '2KI:10:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Life.</i> These 80 were stationed at the doors, while the rest slaughtered the unhappy idolaters, (Menochius) who were all by themselves, like the reprobate separated from the elect, at the last day. (Haydock)'

(Osiander.) --- We read of such a fortress, Judges ix. 46. (Haydock) --- In every city where there was a temple of Baal, the fabric and idols were demolished. (Salien)'

        - '2KI:10:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Dan.</i> This wicked policy, which was designed to prevent his subjects from submitting again to the kings of Juda, proved his ruin.'
      v:030:
        - '2KI:10:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Generation.</i> So Joachaz, Joas, Jeroboam II, and Zacharias, succeeded to the throne. This small temporal reward he obtained for the little good which he had done; while, on the other hand, he was punished for his manifold transgressions. Osee (i. 4,) reproaches him even for the blood which he had spilt in Jezrahel; for, though Achab and Joram were guilty, was Jehu innocent? Can this murder of Ochozias be justified? (Calmet) --- "What advantage was it to him that he received some little transitory reward of a temporal kingdom, for his obedience in exterminating the house of Achab; which he indeed exhibited to gratify his own lust of dominion?" (St Augustine, contra mend. ii. c. 2.) This holy doctor observes, that <i>moral good works</i> are thus rewarded. (Worthington)'

        - '2KI:10:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Weary.</i> Hebrew, "to retrench or destroy." Hazael took occasion, from the absence of Jehu (Calmet) from Galaad, and the disturbances on the west of the Jordan, to dismember the provinces on the east, and to commit the horrid ravages foretold by Eliseus, chap. viii. 12. (Haydock)'
      v:033:
        - '2KI:10:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>Aroer.</i> See Josue xiii. 25. This was a most severe scourge, (Menochius) as all the eastern tribes were lost to Israel. (Haydock)'

      v:001:
        - '2KI:11:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Seed.</i> What cruelties are occasioned by ambition! (Worthington) --- This is one of the most extraordinary proofs recorded in history. Agrippina was but a faint copy of the unnatural Athalia, (Calmet) who knew that she was destined for slaughter, if she should fall into the hands of Jehu. (Menochius) --- Her impiety might also prompt her to destroy all the posterity of David, that she might introduce the worship of idols more easily. (Theodoret)'
      v:002:
        - "2KI:11:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Sister.</i> She had probably a different mother, as she consented to the death of Athalia. (Calmet) --- But the crimes of the latter required such a punishment; and even a daughter would have done wrong to screen her. (Haydock) --- Josabeth, as she is called in 2 Paralipomenon xxii. 11., was married to Joiada the high priest, <i>ibid.</i>[2 Paralipomenon xxii. 11.] --- <i>Out of.</i> Hebrew and Paralipomenon, \"hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bed-chamber\" of the priest, in the temple; (Salien) different from that bed-chamber in which he had hitherto been nursed. Thus the passage may be reconciled. (Menochius) (Calmet) --- Some maintain that Joas was not the son of Ochozias, in whom the line of Solomon ended, but a descendant of David by Nathan. But he is always styled the king's son, and the authority of the false Philo of Annius is of no weight. (Calmet) --- Joiada is called <i>Barachias,</i> \"blessed of the Lord,\" on account of his justice, (St. Jerome) in Matthew xxiii."
      v:003:
        - '2KI:11:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Lord.</i> The case was so extraordinary, that he high priest dispensed with a woman lodging in those apartments. --- <i>Land,</i> for six years, by usurpation. Women were commonly excluded, and she was not of the race of David, 4 Kings viii. 26. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - '2KI:11:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Year,</i> of the age of Joas, ver. 21. (Menochius) --- <i>Centurions.</i> Five in number of the tribe of Levi, (Menochius) commanding each 100 men. Hebrew adds "the rams," (Calmet) to denote "the captains (Protestants) and the runners," or guards. (Haydock) --- Joiada was a man of great authority, virtue, and discretion; so that he was able to manage this delicate affair, and no one gave information to Athalia, as she was detested. The Levites and principal men of Juda were admonished, underhand, to be present on the day appointed. The quality of high priest, and the known probity and zeal for the public good, which were conspicuous in Joiada, as well as his being so nearly related to the lawful heir to the crown, made the people readily come forward. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - "2KI:11:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Sabbath.</i> On this day the Levites replaced each other; so that many might assemble without suspicion. They guarded the king's apartments in the temple. --- <i>The gate of Sur,</i> or <i>of the foundation,</i> (2 Paralipomenon xxiii. 5.) and the western gate leading to the palace. (Calmet) --- <i>Sur,</i> or \"the gate of the lords,\" (Chaldean) is generally supposed to be on the opposite side. (Menochius) --- But this is uncertain, as well as the situation of <i>Messa,</i> which is perhaps the Musach, chap. xvi. 18. This was probably some building or covert adjoining the temple, (Calmet) either belonging to some private person, (Menochius) or designed to contain the ashes, &c., taken from the temple; (Villalpand ii. 32.) or a tribune for the king in the temple. (Haydock) -- The Chaldean seems to have explained it as an adverb, <i>sollicitè,</i> \"with diligence,\" (Menochius) as well as the Septuagint, (Du Hamel) which is consonant to Vatable; you shall guard the house \"from desertion.\" Let no one quit his post. (Menochius)"
      v:007:
        - "2KI:11:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Of you.</i> Levites, who waited on the king's person alternately. (Calmet) --- They were divided into three parts, being in actual service, ver. 6. Those who went out of office were twice the number, and are here told what to do. Sa thinks that those who entered upon duty, and those who went out, formed two thirds of the Levites, ver. 9., and 2 Paralipomenon xxiii. 8. (Menochius)"
      v:008:
        - '2KI:11:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Temple,</i> to cause confusion, Syriac, &c. The court of the priests, (Ezechiel xli. 9.) and that of Israel, (Josephus, [Antiquities?] viii. 4.) were separated by walls, beyond which strangers were not allowed to pass. (Calmet) --- <i>Slain,</i> being first cast out, ver. 15. (Menochius) --- Great respect is due to holy places, and hence comes the privilege of sanctuaries. (Worthington)'
      v:010:
        - '2KI:11:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>David.</i> There was a sort of arsenal in the temple, containing arms consecrated to the Lord by David and his valiant men, in memory of their victories, 2 Kings viii. 11., and 1 Paralipomenon xviii. 11. The usual band of Levites had proper arms, but more were employed on this occasion. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - '2KI:11:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Right,</i> or south, leading to the palace, (Menochius) whence the greatest danger was feared. (Calmet) --- <i>Altar</i> of holocausts, that it might not impede the sight of the king. (Menochius)'
      v:012:
        - '2KI:11:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>The testimony.</i> The book of the law. (Challoner) --- So Job (xxxi. 35, 36.) wished to have the sentence pronounced by God as a crown upon his head. The Orientals still lift to their heads the letters which they have received from people whom they wish to honour. (Thevenot, 46.) --- Some think that the diadem was adorned with phylacteries, or scrolls, containing parts of the law, (Grotius) particularly what related to the king; (Haydock) or that Joas held in his hand a roll of vellum, containing those instructions, (Deuteronomy xvii. 18., and 2 Paralipomenon xxiii. 11.) instead of a sceptre. --- <i>Anointed him,</i> by the hands of Joiada; as this ceremony was requisite on account of the usurpation of Athalia. In peaceable times the unction was not given, (Calmet) according to the Jews, (Haydock) whose sentiment is elsewhere shewn to be unsatisfactory. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - '2KI:11:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Going in.</i> She must have been attended by a strong guard, to force the passage through the Levites at the door. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - '2KI:11:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>A tribunal.</i> A tribune, or place elevated above the rest. (Challoner) --- Hebrew, "on a pillar." Solomon had stood upon one of brass, three cubits high and five broad. See chap. xxiii. 3., and 2 Paralipomenon vi. 13.'
      v:015:
        - '2KI:11:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Precinct.</i> Hebrew <i>sederoth,</i> (untranslated by the Septuagint and (Haydock) improperly supposed by Josephus to be the torrent Cedron) means, "the ranks" of the guards, (Calmet) or, "ranges" of the sacred buildings, which her impure blood must not defile. (Haydock) --- <i>Follow her,</i> as an accomplice. (Menochius)'
      v:016:
        - "2KI:11:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Thrust.</i> Hebrew, \"and she went by the way by which the horses enter the king's house. When she was come within the horse-gate of the palace, they killed her there,\" 2 Paralipomenon xxiii. 15. Such was the ignominious end of this true daughter of Jezabel! (Haydock)"
      v:017:
        - '2KI:11:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>People.</i> Joiada, as mediator (Calmet) between God, the king, and the people, engaged the two latter to be faithful to their common Lord, and to each other. They promised mutually to observe the laws, and, on that condition, the high priest gave them an assurance that God would protect them. (Haydock) --- The covenant entered into by their fathers (Exodus xix. 5.) was renewed. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - '2KI:11:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Altar.</i> Many of the sacred ornaments belonging to the temple had been transported to the house of Baal, probably on Mount Olivet, where Solomon had formerly erected such buildings, 3 Kings xi. 5., and 2 Paralipomenon xxiv. 7. The reform of the state justly, therefore, began with the destruction of this profane and sacrilegious place. --- <i>Lord,</i> according to the former regulations, which had been lately ill observed, to prevent any thing unclean from coming in, 2 Paralipomenon xxiii. 19. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "the priest placed overseers ({GREEK:START episkopons}ηπισκοπονσ{GREEK:END}) in the house of the Lord. (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - '2KI:11:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Phelethi.</i> In the Hebrew of the books of Kings we read nothing of these bands after the reign of David. The same expressions occur here as [in] ver. 4., "the centurions, the rams, (or captains) and the runners," (Calmet) or guards. (Protestants) (Haydock) --- <i>Gate,</i> on the west. Athalia had probably entered by the south. --- <i>Kings.</i> It was made of ivory, &c., 3 Kings x. 18. (Calmet)'

        - '2KI:13:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>East,</i> looking towards Galaad, (Hadock) which the Syrians occupied. (Menochius) --- These actions were all significative and prophetical. The throwing of a dart was formerly the mode of declaring war. (Virgil, Æneid ix.) Justin (ii.) says, "Alexander first threw a javelin, as against a hostile country." Thus also the ancients took possession. (Varro) (V. Max. iii., &c.) The people of Andros and Chalcis, sent each a deputy to seize Acanthos, when it had been abandoned by its inhabitants. The man from Andros, perceiving the other before him, threw his dart at the gate, and it was decided that he had thus lawfully obtained possession. (Plutarch, q. Græc.; Selden, Mare. Claus. iv.) --- The action of Joas may be considered in both lights. --- <i>Them.</i> We do not read the particulars of this battle: but it must have been very bloody. One of the three victories (ver. 25.) of Joas was probably obtained at <i>Aphec,</i> (Calmet) a place memorable for the victory of Achab, over the same Syrians, 3 Kings xx. 26. (Menochius)'

By this it appears, that God had revealed to the prophet that the king should overcome the Syrians, as many times as he should then strike on the ground; but, as he had not, at the same time, revealed to him how often the king would strike, the prophet was concerned to see that he struck but thrice. (Challoner) --- Joas was assured that he should <i>consume</i> the Syrians. But this was to be understood, provided he performed his part, (Menochius; Tirinus) and that destruction was not said to be entire. (Haydock)'

His perfect character is given, Ecclesiasticus xlviii. 13. His double spirit represents the plentitude of grace in Jesus Christ; as his raising of the child to life, in such a wonderful manner, denotes his incarnation. The waters of Jericho made sweet, and the healing of Naaman, set before us the virtue of baptism: as the widow's oil shews the great graces which are bestowed by Christ upon his Church. The children devoured, and the Syrians struck blind, remind us of the perversity and blindness of infidels, who will not acknowledge the truth, Matthew xiii. 14. We must now see how the bones of Eliseus <i>prophesied:</i> <b>1.</b> By raising the dead to life, as a confirmation of all his former predictions; <b>2.</b> as proof of a future resurrection, of the virtue of relics, and of the influence of the saints in heaven, whose souls were formerly united to their bodies, and were filled with the Holy Spirit; (St. Cyril of Jerusalem, cat. xviii. Illum.) <b>3.</b> in as much as this miracle was a figure of Christ's resurrection, who raised himself to life, and those who believe in him: (Calmet) while Eliseus, in the like state of death, had only raised another. (Haydock) (St. Max., hom. i. de pasc.) --- <i>Same.</i> Septuagint, Hebrew, and Syriac, \"at the coming in of the year;\" (Haydock) or, \"the next year.\" (Pagnin)"

This was removed in the hurry, and the corpse thrown into the same recess, which had been prepared for the remains of the prophet. Josephus ([Antiquities?] ix. 8.) relates the history in a different manner, and pretends that robbers having slain a person, threw his corpse accidentally into the tomb of Eliseus. The Rabbins tell us his name was Sellum, and that he died again immediately, because he was a wicked man, which would render the miracle, in a manner, useless. (Calmet) --- By it God honoured his servant, and convinced the Israelites that what he had so lately foretold, respecting the Syrians, would undoubtedly take place. (Menochius)'
      v:023:
        - '2KI:13:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Time.</i> Long before the captivity of Babylon, the Israelites had been led captives, to return no more in a body. Some stragglers mixed with the Jews, and inhabited the country under that appellation. It would seem that this was written before the overturning of the kingdom of Israel. (Haydock)'

(Haydock) --- Abner said in the same sense, "Let the young men rise and play," 2 Kings ii. 14; and Virgil, (Æneid xii.) <i>Inter se coiisse viros & cernere ferro.</i> Amasias had many reasons to be displeased with the king of Israel. He might justly redemand part of the money, (Calmet) as he had not employed the soldiers. (Haydock) --- They had also committed depredations in Juda. (Paralipomenon) Jehu had slain Ochozias, and many of his relations. (Calmet) --- Josephus also observes that he now required Israel to return to his obedience, and acknowledge the power of the lawful descendants of David. (Sanctius)'

(Azrien.) Carpzovius maintains that Azarias and Usias are two names of the same person. (Crit. p. 789.) But if he should find Carpzovius, Carpzorvius, and Carpzoviu, in the same book, would he not think them the same name erroneously printed? Kennicott, (Dis. i. p. 478.) who observes that the Syriac and Arabic versions have here, as in the sequel, Uzia, and St. Matthew (i. 8.) calls the king Ozias, conformably to 2 Paralipomenon xxvi. 1., &c.

      v:003: '2KI:14:3 | 3 | 3 | And he did that which was right before the Lord, but yet not like David, his father. He did according to all things that Joas, his father, did,'

      v:007: '2KI:14:7 | 7 | 7 | He slew of Edom, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}in the valley of the Salt-pits, ten thousand men, and took the rock by war, and called the name thereof Jectehel, unto this day.'

      v:010: '2KI:14:10 | 10 | 10 | Thou hast beaten and prevailed over Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up; be content with <i>this</i> glory, and sit at home; why provokest thou evil, that thou shouldst fall, and Juda with thee?'
      v:011: '2KI:14:11 | 11 | 11 | But Amasias did not rest satisfied. So Joas, king of Israel, went up; and he and Amasias, king of Juda, saw one another in Bethsames, a town in Juda.'

      v:013: '2KI:14:13 | 13 | 13 | But Joas, king of Israel, took Amasias, king of Juda, the son of Joas, the son of Ochozias, in Bethsames, and brought him into Jerusalem; and he broke down the wall of Jerusalem, from the gate of Ephraim to the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits.'
      v:014: "2KI:14:14 | 14 | 14 | And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord, and in the king's treasures, and hostages, and returned to Samaria."

        - "2KI:15:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Twentieth.</i> Houbigant endeavours to shew it should be, \"the 14th;\" Capellus says, the 17th; (Haydock) and others have suspected that the number is incorrectly printed. (Grotius, &c.) --- But this expedient ought only to be adopted when no other can give satisfaction; and this difficulty may be obviated by saying, that Jeroboam's reign with his father continued six years, and that after he had held the septre nineteen years alone, Azarias commenced; (Calmet; Usher) or, that there was an interregnum of eleven years, which is not probable. (Capel) --- <i>Azarias;</i> otherwise called Ozias; (Challoner) and this was his real name. (Grotius) See chap. xiv. 21. (Haydock)"
      v:003:
        - '2KI:15:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Lord.</i> Many laudable actions are specified, 2 Paralipomenon xxvi. 4. But at last, forgetting the instructions of the prophet Zacharias, he opened his heart to pride, the bane of great souls, and would arrogate to himself the rights of the priesthood, which brought on his leprosy. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - '2KI:15:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>But.</i> In this he was not different from his father, chap. xiv. 4.'

        - '2KI:15:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>A leper.</i> In punishment of his usurping the priestly functions, 2 Paralipomenon xxvi. 19. (Challoner) (Worthington) --- The priests boldly remonstrated with him, but to no effect; till the king perceived himself stricken with the leprosy. Josephus ([Antiquities?] ix. 10.) says, a dreadful earthquake was felt at the same time, which is supposed to be that mentioned [in] Amos i. 1., and Zacharias xiv. 5; (St. Jerome, &c.) though Usher produces some chronological difficulties against this opinion: but they are founded on error. (Calmet) --- <i>Free.</i> Paralipomenon <i>apart;</i> at a distance from all. (Haydock) --- The like rules were observed in cities, as in the camp, Leviticus xiii. 46. (Menochius) --- Ozias was in a manner <i>dead</i> to all civil transactions; and Isaias (vi. 1.) probably refers to this event. Syriac and Arabic, "he remained hidden." Josephus (ibid.[ix. 10.]) says, "leading a private life." Thus aiming at too much, he lost all! (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - '2KI:15:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>David:</i> or, <i>Ozias slept....and they buried him in the field of the royal sepulchre, because he was a leper, and Joatham,</i> &c., 2 Paralipomenon xxvi. 23. (Haydock) --- Such an aversion had people for lepers, that they would not even bury them with others. (Calmet) --- Yet he was treated with some honour. (Worthington)'
      v:008:
        - '2KI:15:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Thirtieth.</i> Usher would place an interregnum of eleven years and a half, after the death of Jeroboam, to make the first year of Zacharias correspond with the 38th of Azarias, during which, he supposes, the troubles mentioned [in] Amos vii., and viii., happened. But this interregnum has no foundation, ver. 5. (Calmet) --- Capellus says it would have lasted above 22 years. He and Houbigant would read, 28th: the latter adds ten years to the reign of Zacharias. The transcriber might easily omit the years, as they end in the same manner as months. Arabic has "six years;" whence we may infer, that the copies formerly varied. The exploits of Zacharias require a longer space than <i>six months.</i> (Chron. sac. p. 107, 110.)'
      v:010:
        - '2KI:15:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Place,</i> having before taken his measures with the conspirators; (ver. 15.) so that he had not to fear the resentment of the people. He cut off the last king of the family of Jehu; (Haydock) probably at Jezrahel, Osee i. 5. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - '2KI:15:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Manahem,</i> general of Zacharias, revenged his death, and then returning to Tharsa[Thersa?], treated it and the neighbouring city, <i>Thapsa,</i> with the utmost fury. So Josephus, [Antiquities?] ix. 11. But his conjectures are to be received with caution.'
      v:017:
        - '2KI:15:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Ten years.</i> Dating from the time that he was enabled to enjoy the throne in peace, after a struggle of eleven months. (Usher, the year of the world 3233.) --- Phul rendered him this service, having received presents, and one of the golden calves, (Osee x. 6., and xiii.) besides 1000 talents, ver. 19.'
      v:018:
        - '2KI:15:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Days.</i> During which Jeroboam or Manahem swayed the sceptre. (Calmet) --- The Septuagint refer <i>all his days</i> to the following verse, (Haydock) which seems to intimate that the tribute was required annually, as may be gathered from the Vulgate <i>veniebat.</i> (Menochius) --- But Phul probably received the talents only once, to indemnify him for his trouble. He was perhaps the father of Sardanapalus, Anacindaraxes, &c. Phul was the first of the Assyrian monarchs who came into the land of Israel, where we shall find them too often in the sequel. He probably repented on the preaching of Jonas, and averted the scourge (Calmet) which fell upon the city during the reign of his son. (Haydock)'

        - '2KI:15:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Israel.</i> This book is lost. (Haydock) --- The Paralipomenon takes no notice of these kings; but relates only the transactions of the kings of Juda after Joas gained the victory; which greatly abridged their power, chap. xiv. 14.'
      v:027:
        - '2KI:15:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Romelia.</i> St. Jerome (ep. 142.) places the birth of Romulus in this year, which preceded the famous Olympiads. But Salien differs that event 14 years. (The year before Christ 769.) (Haydock)'
      v:029:
        - '2KI:15:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Assyria,</i> at the invitation of Achaz, chap. xvi. 7. --- <i>Theglathphalasar</i> is probably the same who is called Ninus the younger, or Thilgam, (Ælian. animal. xii. 21.) by profane writers. He re-established the kingdom of Nineve in part, after the city had been taken, under his father Sardanapalus, by Arbaces, founder of the empire of the Medes, and by Belesus, Narbonassar, or Baladan, who reigned at Babylon. Such was the state of the eastern empires at this time. (Calmet) --- <i>Aion,</i> or Ahion, (3 Kings xv. 20.) perhaps the Enan of Ezechiel xlviii. 1. (Haydock) --- <i>Maacha,</i> whither Seba had retreatd, 2 Kings xx. 14. Hebrew <i>Abel-beth-maacha.</i> --- <i>Galaad,</i> comprising all the east of the Jordan. (Calmet) --- <i>Nephthali,</i> to the north-west. (Haydock) --- Thus the Galileans and Nephthali were transported into Assyria, to repeople it after the late ravages. The tribe in Galaad were fixed on the river Gozan, 1 Paralipomenon v. 26.'
      v:030:
        - "2KI:15:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>In the twentieth year of Joatham.</i> That is, in the twentieth year from the beginning of Joatham's reign. The sacred writer chooses rather to follow here this date, than to speak of the years of Achaz, who had not yet been mentioned. (Challoner) --- But Joatham reigned only 16 years, (ver. 33.) so that this was the fourth year of Achaz. (Haydock) --- Usher says that Osee did not ascend the throne till nine years after the death of Phacee, as he is asserted to have commenced his reign in the twelfth year of Achaz, chap. xvii. 1. But another difficulty arises from the mention of this 20th year, as Phacee would have reigned 22, instead of 20; (ver. 27.) for Joatham only commenced in the second year of Phacee. To reconcile these passages, we may conclude that Osee conspired against the king of Israel in the 18th year of Joatham, gained possession of part of the kingdom in the 20th of the same prince, and of the whole in the 12th of Achaz. (Calmet) --- The pretended interregnum ought to be rejected, as the murderer of the late king would not delay to ascend the throne. Houbigant adds 10 years to the reign of Phacee, as well as to that of Zacharias: the dates assigned to the kings of Israel being otherwise so much deficient, p. 113."

    commentary:
      v:002:
        - "2KI:16:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>When he,</i> Joatham, \"had begun,\" <i>cœpisset.</i> (Haydock) --- Thus Junius evades the following difficulty. (Du Hamel) --- <i>Sixteen,</i> consequently he died when he was 36 years old. As Ezechias was 25 when he came to the throne, Achab must have been a father at 11 (Calmet) or 12 years of age. (Bochart, Dissert. xxiii.) --- St. Jerome asserts the same of Solomon, and observes, that \"many things which seem incredible in Scripture, are nevertheless true.\" (ep. ad Vital.) He, with some others, has recourse to a miracle. Others suppose that Ezechias was an adopted son, or kinsman, or that the numbers are incorrect, &c. But we are assured by respectable authors, (Haydock) that people have children very soon in the hotter climates. Busbeque (Ep. 3.) says, in Colchis many are mothers at ten years of age; and to convince the incredulous, produce their infants \"not much bigger than a large frog.\" Albert the Great says he knew one who had a child at 10, and Navarre (following Sanchez, Matthew vii. 2, 5. disp. 104.) was credibly informed that a similar fact was seen at Naples. Mandesle observes that this is common in India. He says one had lately a child at six years of age, which was there thought remarkable. St. Jerome mentions a boy who became a father at 10, and Sanchez relates that the same happened in Spain. A boy under 12 had a child by a girl of 10, in Provence. (Scaliger Elenc.) The Romans laws fix upon the age of 14 for males, and 12 for females' lawfully marrying; (Haydock) though many examples of people having children before that age are produced by Tiraqueau, 6. conn. 36. Yet physicians require 13 in males, and 14 years complete in females before they are capable of this effect. (Genebrard) St. Augustine (City of God xv. 11., and xvi. c. ult. and in psalm civ.) maintains that a person of 10 years of age is unfit for generation. (Calmet) --- <i>Malitia supplet ætatem.</i> Achaz was a monster of wickedness. (Haydock) --- In the first year of his reign, and in the fifth Olympiad, the Ephori were appointed at Sparta under Theopompus, nephew of Lycurgus. (Salien, the year before Christ 59.)"
      v:003:
        - "2KI:16:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Fire,</i> to purify him (or them, Paralipomenon <i>filios,</i> all were treated thus. Haydock) according to the superstitions of the pagans: <i>omnia purgat edax ignis.</i> (Ovid, Fast.) (Theodoret, q. 16.) (Menochius) --- Others believe that the child was burnt to death in honour of Moloch, and in imitation of the Chanaanites, Psalm cv. 37., and Deuteronomy xviii. 10. The Carthaginians were required by Gelon, king of Syracuse, to lay aside this most barbarous custom. (Phil. apoph.) Yet, \"infants were publicly immolated to Saturn, in Africa, till the proconsulate of Tiberius, who ordered the priests to be exposed on those same trees which shaded their crimes, as on votive crosses. This the soldiers, my countrymen, who executed the proconsul's orders, can testify; and still the sacred crime is perpetrated in secret.\" (Tertullian, Apol. viii.) --- How tenacious are people of old errors! (Haydock)"
      v:005:
        - '2KI:16:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Then.</i> In punishment of such enormous crimes, God first delivered Achaz into the hands of Rasin, (2 Paralipomenon xxviii.; St. Jerome, in Isaias vii.) and afterwards Phacee destroyed 120,000 in one battle, and took 200,000 prisoners, whom the prophet Oded persuaded him to release, 2 Paralipomenon xxviii. 8, 11. Salien (the year before Christ 759.) observes that the two kings then joined their forces, and besieged Jerusalem the following year, but to no purpose. (Haydock) --- Isaias was sent before the siege to encourage Achaz, and to promise the miraculous birth of the Messias, as a sign that he should be delivered: and to convince him of it the more, he foretold that the two kings should be destroyed before his own son should be able to say <i>father,</i> Isaias vii. 8., &c. Yet as Achaz did not still amend his life, God sent the same kings the following year (the year of the world 3263.) to lay waste the country. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - '2KI:16:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Juda.</i> Literally, "Jews," Judæos, (Haydock) which is the first time we find this appellation. (Du Hamel) --- <i>Aila,</i> or Elath, which had been taken by Ozias, chap. xiv. 22. (Menochius) --- It seems never to have belonged to <i>Syria,</i> as it was too far from Damascus. Instead of <i>Aram,</i> we should therefore probably read <i>Edom,</i> which words in Hebrew are extremely similar, and have been often mistaken, (Judges xi. 17.; Calmet) particularly as we find that the <i>Edomites</i> took possession of the city. This latter word is indeed <i>Syrians</i> in Hebrew, &c. (Haydock) --- Josephus and others maintain that the Syrians seized and kept the place. But they were most likely only invited by the Idumeans to come to their assistance. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - '2KI:16:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Son,</i> vassal, or under thy protection. (Calmet) --- <i>Save me.</i> Achaz sinned by this placing his confidence in man, after the prophet had given him such assurance from the Lord. (Menochius) --- He has soon reason to repent of having brought this proud ally into his dominions, as he proved a great scourge; (2 Paralipomenon xxviii. 20.) no less than the Saxons did to the ancient Britons.'
      v:009:
        - '2KI:16:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Cyrene,</i> not in Egypt, where he had no power, but near the river Cyrus, (Calmet) in higher Media. (Josephus) --- Hebrew, "and took it and carried <i>the inhabitants</i> captives to Kir," (Haydock) whence the Syrians had come originally, Amos ix. 7. Arbaces, who had dismembered Media from the Assyrians empire, was now dead, and the king of Nineve had retaken several cities, occupying Rages, &c., (Tobias i. 16., &c.) before Dejoces mounted the throne, and extended the empire of the Medes. (Usher) --- The people of Sepharvaim lived also on the borders of Media, chap. xviii. 11.'
      v:010:
        - '2KI:16:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>To meet,</i> and congratulate the king on his victory, and perhaps to divert him from proceeding any father. (Calmet) --- But it was too late, ver. 7. (Haydock) --- The same year Phacee hastened to defend his dominions, but was slain by Osee. (Salien, the year before Christ 757.)'
      v:011:
        - "2KI:16:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Priest,</i> or pontiff, as no other would have dared to make this innovation. (Salien) --- He was guilty of a great weakness; as the altar of Solomon had been so solemnly consecrated by God's presence. All changes in religion are dangerous. The Machabees behaved with far greater respect, with regard to the altar which had been profaned, 1 Machabees iv. 45. (Calmet) --- Isaias (viii. 2.) calls this priest a <i>faithful,</i> or competent, <i>witness,</i> (Haydock) on account of his dignity, not approving his conduct. (Salien) --- But he had not erected this altar when the prophet spoke thus to him. (Du Hamel)"
      v:012:
        - '2KI:16:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>And worshipped.</i> Hebrew simply, "and the king approached to the altar, and offered on it (<b>13</b>) his holocaust and his meat (or flour) offering, and poured his drink-offering, and the blood of his peace-offerings, upon the altar." (Haydock) --- He dedicated it with all sorts of sacrifices, forbidding any other to be used in the temple. But shortly after he shut up the temple entirely, 2 Paralipomenon xxviii. 24., and xxix. 3. He offered sacrifice to the true God, (ver. 15.; Menochius) unlawfully.'
      v:014:
        - '2KI:16:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>And from.</i> Hebrew, "from between the <i>new</i> altar and the house of," &c. (Haydock) --- Achaz had placed his altar before that of Solomon: but he afterwards removed the latter from the right-hand of the sanctuary, to a corner of the court, on the <i>north</i> side. (Calmet) --- In the midst of his distress, he despised God; sacrificed to the gods of the Syrians, as more powerful and victorious than the Lord; pillaged the temple, which he shut up during the remainder of his reign, (Haydock) and erected altars for himself in all the corners of Jerusalem, 2 Paralipomenon xxviii. 24.'
      v:015:
        - "2KI:16:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Morning,</i> as prescribed in the law, Exodus xxix. 38. --- <i>King's</i> ordained for sin: (Leviticus iv. 22.) or instituted by Solomon, who left a fund. (Haydock) (2 Paralipomenon viii. 12.) (Menochius) --- The law says nothing about the king's daily holocaust and <i>sacrifice</i> of flour. (Haydock) --- But it probably was offered after the morning and evening sacrifices. This Achaz calls <i>his own,</i> (ver. 12.; Calmet) as he had not yet laid aside the practice. --- <i>Pleasure.</i> Hebrew, \"to inquire about.\" (Haydock) --- I shall do what I think proper with it. (Menochius)"
      v:017:
        - '2KI:16:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Stone,</i> all out of avarice, (Haydock) and contempt of the Lord, who chastized him. (Menochius) --- He took away the plates of brass, c., from the doors, (Calmet) which Ezechias was forced to replace, (Haydock) afterwards to take down for the Assyrian, chap. xviii. 16. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - "2KI:16:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Musach.</i> The covert, or pavilion, or tribune for the king. (Challoner) --- Achaz would not have his ally to be in the court, but placed his throne in the temple. (Du Hamel) --- Septuagint, \"and the foundation of the chair he built in the house of the Lord.\" (Haydock) --- Hebrew, \"and the (<i>musac</i>) covert, <i>or</i> tribune of the sabbath, which they had built in the temple, and the king's entry without, the turned (Haydock) round (Menochius) from the temple, for the king of Assur.\" He despoiled these rich ornaments, to gratify the Assyrian. (Haydock) --- Solomon had built a most magnificent tribune, 2 Paralipomenon vi. 13. See chap. xi. 6. The <i>musach of Juda,</i> was the pulpit; from which the law was read, Isaias xxii. 8. The king's tribune was near the eastern gate, which was only opened on the sabbath, Ezechiel xlvi. 1. Some believe that the <i>musach</i> was a large curtain, suspended over the court, to keep off the sun's beams. Eupolemus speaks of some very magnificent ones, (Eusebius, præp. ix. 34.) as does also Josephus; such as those which covered the Roman theatres. Others think it was a tent for the priests to take a little rest, or for the door-keepers, or a chest designed to receive the contributions for the repairs of the temple, or for the king to distribute his alms, or a covered throne for him to sit down on. (Calmet)"
      v:019:

        - '2KI:16:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>With them;</i> but not in the same sepulchre, on account of his impiety, 2 Paralipomenon xxviii. 27. (Calmet) --- In the 5th year of his reign, the Idumeans harassed the country, and in the 6th, the Philistines took several towns; (Salien) so that he fell a prey to enemies on all sides, and was memorable for nothing but impiety and disasters. (Haydock) --- Rome was built, and Numa born, on the 21st of April, in the 9th year of Achaz, and the first of the 7th Olympiad. (Salien, the year before Christ 751.)'

      v:008: "2KI:16:8 | 8 | 8 | And when he had gathered together the silver and gold that could be found in the house of the Lord, and in the king's treasures, he sent it for a present to the king of the Assyrians."

      v:017: '2KI:16:17 | 17 | 17 | And king Achaz took away the graven bases, and the laver that was upon them: and he took down the sea from the brazen oxen that held it up, and put it upon a pavement of stone.'
      v:018: "2KI:16:18 | 18 | 18 | The musach also for the sabbath, which he had built in the temple, and the king's entry from without, he turned into the temple of the Lord, because of the king of the Assyrians."

(Haydock) --- Till this time, Osee had been tributary to the Assyrian monarch. (Grotius) --- Hebrew may be, "in the 12th year....Osee....had reigned....nine years; which is true. (Calmet) --- He reigned so long afterwards, ver. 6. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - '2KI:17:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Him.</i> The Jews say, that he did not hinder his subjects from going to Jerusalem to adore. One of the golden calves had been sent away by Manahem, Osee x. 5. (Calmet) --- Yet under this less wicked king the nation is destroyed, as their crimes were come to the height; and Osee had not sufficient virtue to suspend the stroke of divine justice any longer. (Haydock)'

        - '2KI:17:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Salmanasar,</i> who is called Salman, or Salomo; (Osee x. 14.) and Enemassar, in the Greek of Toby[Tobias]. The Tyrians relate that he took many of their towns, but that Tyre sustained a siege of five years. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] ix. 14.)'
      v:004:
        - '2KI:17:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Sua;</i> probably Sabachon, king of Ethiopia, who made himself master of Egypt, and burnt king Bocchoris alive. Herodotus (ii. 137.) calls him Abacus. Jocquelot thinks that Sethon is meant, and that he was invaded by Sennacherib on account of this league with Osee. (Calmet) --- <i>Prison,</i> after he had taken the city, (Haydock) which held out three years. This great city was then reduced to a heap of ruins, and so continued till after the captivity of the Jews, (1 Esdras iv. 17.) when it began to be peopled again. The inhabitants revolted against Alexander the Great, who placed Macedonians in their city, and gave the territory to the Jews. It was afterwards seized by the kings of Egypt and of Syria. But Hyrcan retook it, and levelled it with the ground. Gabinius built another town here, which bore his name till Herod greatly enlarged it, and called it Sebaste. (Calmet) --- The prophets describe the distress of Samaria, Osee x. 4., and xiv. 1., Micheas i. 6., and Jeremias xxxi. 5.)'
      v:006:
        - '2KI:17:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Medes.</i> See chap. xvi. 9. The great maxim and policy of these nations, was to transport the conquered nations to a distant country, in order to prevent any revolts. (Calmet)'

      v:015:
        - '2KI:17:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Testimonies.</i> The ceremonial law was in memory of some great transactions, as the sabbath was of the creation; and the whole law was given with great solemnity, in presence of witnesses. (Calmet)'
      v:016:

Israel began to be rejected by God, when the schism took place. (Haydock) --- It was entirely lost, when Salmanasar took the people into captivity. Some few were left; and these formed a part of the kingdom of Josias, on their returning to the service of the true God, (2 Paralipomenon xxxiv. 6.) while others fled into Egypt, Osee viii. 13., and ix. 3. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - '2KI:17:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Day.</i> If Esdras was the author of this book, as it is very probable, this observation would tend to show how much more favourably the Jews were treated than the kingdom of Israel, which was still, for the most part, in captivity. (Calmet)'
      v:024:
        - '2KI:17:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>King,</i> Assaraddon, who led away the remnants of Israel, and fulfilled the prediction, Isaias vii. 8. (Du Hamel) --- <i>Babylon,</i> or the territory. These people had been lately conquered from the Babylonian empire, from Syria, &c. --- <i>Cutha:</i> the greatest part were from this city; so that the Samaritans were afterwards called Cutheans. --- <i>Emath,</i> on the Orontes. --- <i>Sepharvaim;</i> or the Saspires, near Media. (Calmet) --- We find several other places mentioned, 1 Esdras iv. 9. (Haydock)'
      v:025:
        - '2KI:17:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Lions.</i> The Samaritan Chronicle says the fruits, though beautiful to the eye, were of a poisonous quality; and Josephus, as usual, ([Antiquities?] ix. 14.) alters the text, saying that the people were afflicted with pestilence, and the oracle being consulted, told them to worship the High God; on which account, they desired the king to send them a priest. (Calmet) --- These nations had not been accustomed <i>to fear the Lord</i> in their own country; but God was more offended when they exercised their idolatrous worship in that land, which he had chosen in a particular manner for himself. (Menochius) --- He suffers wickedness and infidelity to prevail to a certain point; but when his patience is exhausted, (Calmet) all nature fights for him against the wicked. (Haydock)'
      v:026:
        - '2KI:17:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>King;</i> Assar-adon, 1 Esdras iv. 2. They did not send as soon as they came into the country. --- <i>Land.</i> They reason according to their false notions, as if a plurality of gods were not incompatible: and all would go on well, if each were served according to his will. On the same principle, they united the worship of the true God with that of idols, (Calmet) as had been done before by the Israelites. (Menochius) --- Yet God having shewn that he could have forced them to comply, (Tostat) was pleased to remove the scourge; as if he preferred that imperfect worship rather than to suffer pure idolatry to reign. (Genebrard)'
      v:027:
        - '2KI:17:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Let him.</i> Hebrew, Chaldean, Septuagint, "them go." Probably more went; but <i>one</i> was of superior dignity. He might have been priest of the golden calves, as none of the priests of Jerusalem had yet been taken. Hence he taught the Cutheans to join the worship of God with that of idols. Some think that no part of the Scripture was used among them, till the building of the temple by Sanballat, on Mount Garizim: (Le Quien, Antiquitè. v. 13.) but this is extremely improbable. How should he pretend to teach the law without the books of Moses? (Haydock) --- The Samaritans have retained the Pentateuch in the Phœnician character, while the Jews have insensibly adopted the Chaldee, during their captivity. On some occasions, these people have boasted of their descent from the patriarchs, John iv. 12., and 20. But in times of danger, they have confessed their true origin. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] ix. fin., and xii. 5.'
      v:028:
        - '2KI:17:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Bethel.</i> Garizim was not then honoured with the temple, as the Samaritans would pretend. (Chronicles) They wished to join in building that at Jerusalem, under Esdras. (Calmet) --- <i>Lord.</i> Collins would make us believe, that the Samaritans continued "for a long time" without the Pentateuch, and all "heathens for many ages." But the first supposition "is to me incredible," says Kennicott; and Hottinger himself allows, that the priests did bring back a copy of the law "exactly corresponding with the autograph of Moses." (Exert. p. 8.) And as for the Samaritans being heathens, Prideaux, whom this infidel writer quotes, (Haydock) says, "consistently with his Bible, that they continued in that gross idolatry of worshipping other gods <i>in conjunction with the True;</i> which last words are very unfairly omitted." (Kennicott, Diss. ii. p. 115.) --- This was the true origin and state of this mixture of nations, who were sent to cultivate the lands of Samaria. (Haydock)'
      v:029:
        - '2KI:17:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Dwelt.</i> This impure service did not deserve a mitigation of the late chastisement. But God often punishes in this world (Haydock) to manifest his glory, (John ix. 3.) and spares to display his power (Calmet) and goodness. (Haydock) --- He had sufficiently convinced these nations of his dominion over all.'
      v:030:
        - '2KI:17:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Socoth-benoth,</i> "the tents of young women," who prostituted themselves once in their lives at Babylon, in honour of Mylitta. (Herodotus ii. 199.) --- <i>Nergel,</i> "light." (Calmet) --- The Pyreia (Haydock) of the Persians are famous in history. (Strabo xv.) (Selden, Synt. ii. 8.) --- <i>Asima,</i> like an ape, goat, &c. (Calmet)'
      v:031:
        - '2KI:17:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Hevites,</i> who came from Ava. --- <i>Nebahaz.</i> "Nebo the seeing, <i>or</i> living and possessing." Nebo was a famous idol of Babylon. --- <i>Tharthac;</i> perhaps Sar, (prince) Sak, or Sesac, (Jeremias xxv. 26., and li. 41.) the sun, &c. --- <i>Adramelech,</i> "the magnificent king," and <i>Anamelech,</i> "the king of clemency," may denote the sun and moon; as these were the divinities commonly adored in the East, under various names. The same victims were offered to these as to Moloc and Saturn; whence we may infer, that they were the same idols. St. Jerome translates the work of Eusebius on the Hebrews, (Calmet) and places without any disapprobation of his opinion, that Socoth-benoth, &c., were the names of towns, which the people built in Samaria. (Haydock)'
      v:032:
        - '2KI:17:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Worshipped,</i> or appeared to worship: for true religion admits of no false god. (Worthington) --- <i>Lowest.</i> This expression sometimes means the most noble. (Haydock) --- But the priests were chosen from the midst of the people, without examination. They employed the priest, whom the king had sent for the worship of the true God, whilst others were appointed to serve the idols. (Calmet)'
      v:034:
        - '2KI:17:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>His ceremonies.</i> Hebrew, "they fear not the Lord, neither do they after their statutes." (Protestants) (Haydock) --- This involves a sort of contradiction, unless we explain it of the Israelites; though they had not been mentioned before. There is a confusion in the original text; and ver. 41 seems to require that we should understand it iin this manner, as the Cutheans could hardly be blamed for neglecting a thing of which they had before no knowledge. The Israelites are justly blamed for obstinately continuing in their prevarication, even in the midst of their captivity. The Syriac and Arabic translate, "The Israelites have been forced to leave their country, because they have abandoned the Lord; and they have not obeyed his laws, his precepts, and his ordinances, which he gave to," &c. Many adopt this explanation. (Junius; Vatable, &c.) (Calmet) --- Septuagint make these people unite the true and the false worship, as ver. 41. "They did according to their judgment. These fear, and do according to their justifications ({GREEK:START dikaiomata}δικαιωατα{GREEK:END}) and decision; and according to the law," &c. (Haydock)'

(Menochius) --- <i>Nohestan;</i> that is, <i>their brass,</i> or <i>a little brass.</i> So he called it in comtempt, because they had made a god of it. (Challoner) --- Before, this image had been treated with due respect. When any relic or image becomes the occasion of abuse in the Catholic Church, it is thus taken away, or the error is otherwise corrected. See St. Augustine, City of God x. 8., Ser. 14., de Verb. Ap., &c. (Worthington) --- Some of the ancients assert, that Ezechias suppressed many books of Solomon, on account of similar abuses. But this seems not to be well attested. We know that he made a collection of some of some of his sentences, Proverbs xxv. 1.'
      v:005:
        - '2KI:18:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Like him.</i> Ezechias was remarkable for many excellent qualities. Yet we must not push these comparisons too far, contrary to the intention of the sacred writers. The same eulogium is given to Josias, (chap. xxiii. 25.) and David seems to be preferred, chap. xix. 34. These three are particularly commended, Ecclesiasticus xlix. 5. (Calmet) --- Their virtues were certainly different in some respects. (Tirinus)'

Syriac, &c., "he was victorious wherever he went." --- <i>Rebelled.</i> The Assyrian assumed an undue authority in consequence of the words of Achaz, (chap. xvi. 7.) and arrogated to himself the authority of doing what he pleased with the people, ver. 32. Ezechias having formed various alliances, judged it necessary to make some resistance. Yet the prophet Isaias (xxx. 1.) complains of his applying to the Egyptians. (Calmet)'

        - "2KI:18:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Sennacherib's</i> expedition in Egypt and Asia are mentioned by Herodotus (ii. 141.) and Berosus, (Josephus, [Antiquities?] x. 1.) but they do not say that he passed farther then Pelusium, (Calmet) the frontier on the Egyptian side of Palestine. (Haydock) --- These expeditions might have been performed in less than eight months, during the 14th year of Ezechias, who fell sick, perhaps soon after the ruin of Sennacherib's army, chap. xx. 1. Isaias (x. 28.) represents the Assyrian proceeding from Gabaa towards Egypt, and thence he <i>ascended</i> to attack the cities of Juda, (ver. 25.) Manresa, (Micheas i. 15.) &c. While he was before Lachis, Ezechias, dreading the horrors of war, purchased a peace: but the tyrant soon after sent to require him to surrender at discretion; and in the mean time he went to besiege Lebna, where his envoys found him, having received no answer from the king of Juda. The haughty Assyrian being obliged to go to meet the king of Chus, sent insolent letters to Ezechias; but the latter was assured that all his menaces were to be despised, and on the same night that Sennacherib left Lebna, the angel destroyed 185,000 of his men. It is thought that the siege of Lachis did not take place till three years after Sennacherib had come into Palestine, and after he had spent that time in attacking Egypt, chap. xix. 24. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] x. 2., and 3.) --- He attempted afterwards to take the southern cities of Juda, in order to cut off all communication with Egypt; as Nabuchodonosor, Holofernes, and Eupator probably intended to do, Jeremias xxiv. 7., Judith vi., and vii., and 1 Machabees vi. 31. (Calmet) --- <i>Offended,</i> and been imprudent. (Menochius) --- <i>Gold,</i> so that the value of each was equal. (Du Hamel) --- Josephus reads, \"or thirty,\" as if that quantity of gold would suffice. (Haydock) --- The <i>talent</i> contains 3000 sicles. (Menochius) --- The heart of Ezechias fainted at the approach of so great an army, though he had before made the greatest preparations, chap. xx. 2., 2 Paralipomenon xxxii. 5., and Ecclesiasticus xlviii. 19.

See Josephus, Jewish Wars vi. 6.'

        - '2KI:18:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Tharthan,</i> or <i>Thathania,</i> (1 Esdras v. 3.) and in the Greek of Isaias xx. 1., means "the president of tributes," or presents. The two other names denote "the chief eunuch," and "the chief butler," and are not proper names. These officers were sent at the head of a <i>strong army</i> to Jerusalem. --- <i>Field,</i> by the torrent Cedron, to the east. There they defied the king, or perhaps endeavoured to persuade him to come out, that they might seize his person. (Calmet) They came in a military capacity, rather than as ambassadors.'

(Haydock) --- The house often refers to the temple, when placed without any explanation, Isaias xxii. 15. (Calmet) --- Eliacim was prefect of the prætorium, (Salien) or grand master of the palace. He was richly dressed, and possessed a great authority over the people. --- <i>Scribe.</i> See Judges viii. 14. This Sobna, according to St. Jerome, is different from the one who was over the house in the days of Manasses, before Eliacim was restored to his office, (Calmet) unless he also was a different person. (Tirinus) --- The Jews say Sobna was deprived of his dignity, on account of his having betrayed the lower city to Sennacherib. See Isaias xxii. 21. --- <i>Recorder,</i> or chancellor, &c., 2 Kings viii. 16. (Calmet)'

      v:022:
        - '2KI:18:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Jerusalem.</i> Many were perhaps displeased at this injunction, and Rabsaces endeavoured to excite them to revolt, and insinuates (Calmet) that the king had made God his enemy, (Haydock) and must expect punishment from him. (Theodoret, in Isaias xxxvi. 5.) He perhaps was ignorant that these altars were contrary to his law. (Menochius) --- Yet the Jews say that Rabsaces was son of Isaias, (ap. St. Jerome, bib.) or a Samaritan.'
      v:023:
        - '2KI:18:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Over.</i> Josephus insinuates that it is a challenge to fight, and that Rabsaces was so confident of victory, that he made this contemptuous proposal, (Haydock) knowing that the subjects of Ezechias were not good horsemen, (Calmet) or that they were comparatively (Haydock) so few in number. (Menochius) --- Hebrew, "agree, <i>or</i> give pledges to my master."'
      v:025:
        - "2KI:18:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Destroy.</i> Prosperity renders a man insolent, and the passions blind him. Rabsaces interprets success to be a sure proof of the divine approbation, and thus attempts to justify all the excesses of his master. (Calmet) --- God only used Sennacherib as a rod to chastise his people. (Menochius) --- The most wicked often represent themselves as the executioners of God's will, and attribute their ambition to his decrees. (Haydock) --- God did not order the Assyrians to destroy the land: he rather threatened to destroy them, Isaias xxxvii., and 2 Paralipomenon xxxii. (Worthington)"

Rabsaces was acquainted with both the languages; as the Jews say he was an apostate, which they infer from this passage, and from the legates tearing their clothes when they heard him blaspheme; as they pretend this was only done when blasphemy came from the mouth of an Israelite. (Grotius) --- But these reasons are very weak. (Calmet) --- The like was practised when any thing terrifying was heard, ver. 37. (Haydock) --- The reasons why the legates desire Rabsaces not to speak in a language which the common soldiers understood, was to prevent them from shewing their indignation by shooting at him, or out of fear, lest they should be induced to cause some sedition.

(Calmet) --- <i>Deliver us.</i> This will not be in his power, no more than it was in that of the other tutelary gods.

(Menochius) --- But they are commonly supposed to be cities. (Haydock) --- <i>Ana</i> is probably a city (Du Hamel) built on both sides of the Euphrates, four days' journey from Bagdat. Isaias does not specify these cities in the parallel passage, but they are found in the letter addressed to Ezechias, Isaias xxxvii. 13. --- <i>Samaria,</i> or the inhabitants who had come from distant parts, and had perhaps revolted. We do not however find that Sennacherib had conquered them, nor does the pretend that all these conquests were made by himself. (Calmet) --- He gives part of the honour to his ancestors, chap. xix. 12., and 2 Paralipomenon xxxii. 13. But he asserts that all the gods of the respective countries of Samaria, &c., had yielded to his superior force. (Haydock) --- Strange infatuation in a man who looked upon the idols as gods! They are in effect nothing, 1 Corinthians viii. 4. But as their votaries were of a different persuasion, ought they not to have acted and spoken consistently? Yet Suetonius (Caius, c. 5.) informs us, that \"on the day when Germanicus died, the temples were stoned, the altars of the gods overturned, the domestic lares thrown out by some into the open air;\" all to express their grief and indignation at the gods, for not preserving his life.

He encamped near Pelusium, where the enemy's army on its arrival was infested with rats, which destroyed their armour, and made them an easy prey. (Herodotus ii. 141.) It is probable that Taphnes, near Pelusium, was the capital city of Tharaca, Isaias xviii., and xxx. 4.

Perhaps this comparison is used through tenderness and affection for a place. (Calmet) --- Even the most timid female would shortly despise the fallen tyrant.

Thus Cyrus diverted the streams of the Gnidus, and of the Euphrates. Hebrew also, perhaps most literally, "I will dry up the rivulets of Egypt." See Isaias xix. 6., and xxxvii. 25.

      v:023: '2KI:19:23 | 23 | 23 | By the hand of thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots I have gone up to the height of the mountains, to the top of Libanus, and have cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir-trees.

      v:024: '2KI:19:24 | 24 | 24 | I have cut down. And I have drunk strange waters, and have dried up with the soles of my feet all the shut-up waters.'

        - "2KI:20:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Days,</i> before the destruction of Sennacherib's army; (ver. 6.; Menochius) though some suppose that Ezechias was afflicted with sickness, because he had not shewn sufficient gratitude for his deliverance, 2 Paralipomenon xxxii. 24. (Eusebius and St. Jerome, in Isaias xxxix. (Calmet) --- But it might be sent only to purify him the more, &c. (Menochius) --- He fell ill the same year that the Assyrian invaded his dominions, ver. 6., and chap. xviii. 13. The nature of his disorder in not fully known. (It was probably an abscess, (Calmet) brought on by a fever; or an ulcer, for which the things which promote suppuration, are always proper. Thus God teaches us to make use of natural remedies, yet so as to place our whole confidence in him. (Haydock) --- Others think it was a pleurisy, (John xxi. Thesaur. 26.) or a quinsey, (Barthol.) or the pestilence, &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Unto death,</i> of an illness, which would naturally have proved mortal; as that of Benadad was the reverse, chap. viii. 10. --- <i>Not live,</i> very shortly; though he does not express the time. We should always bear in mind this awful warning. (Haydock) --- The prediction was conditional, like that of Jonas; (iii. 4.; Calmet) otherwise it would have been sinful to strive to render it ineffectual. (Estius)"

        - "2KI:20:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Before thee.</i> The saints of the old law frequently mention their good works, (Psalm vii. 9., &c., and 2 Esdras xiii. 14.) which is less common in those of the new. When God rewards our good works, he only crowns his own gifts. (Calmet) --- Ezechias had sincerely desired to please God, though he might have given way to some imperfections, ver. 1. (Haydock) --- <i>Weeping;</i> because he thought that the Messias would not be one of his posterity, as he had yet no children, chap. xxi. 1. (St. Jerome) --- The saints of the Old Testament could only be received into Abraham's bosom. We may <i>be with Christ</i> immediately after death; so that it is far less terrible, Philippians i. 23. (Haydock)"

      v:005:
        - '2KI:20:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Day,</i> dating from the time when Isaias spoke. (Tostat) --- This shewed that the cure was miraculous, and not effected by natural remedies only. (Tirinus)'
      v:006:
        - '2KI:20:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Assyrians.</i> It is commonly supposed that this alludes to Sennacherib. But it might refer to his son, who was sending an army, Isaias xx. 1. We ought not to alter the scriptural order of the transactions, without cogent reasons.'

        - '2KI:20:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Figs;</i> dried. They are very serviceable in various disorders of the throat, to mollify, &c. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxiii. 3.) (Aldrov. ii.) --- St. Jerome (in Isaias xxxviii.) acknowledges that they might help to removed the disorder. Grotius is of a contrary opinion; (Calmet) and this would enhance the miracle. See Vales. xxxix. (Menochius) --- At any rate, the discovery of this remedy to the prophet, and its sudden efficacy, were miraculous. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - '2KI:20:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Sign.</i> He is not incredulous, but gives the prophet an occasion of declaring by what authority he spoke thus. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - '2KI:20:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Lines,</i> according to the usual course of the sun. An instantaneous motion of this kind would, in reality, be as difficult, as the retrogradation. But it might not strike the people so much. (Haydock) --- Some take the lines to designate hours. But the sun is never up twenty hours in that country; and it must have been at such a height, as that it might appear visibly to recede, or to go forward, ten lines. We may therefore suppose, that they consisted only of half hours, (Tirinus) or less. (Calmet) --- If the retrograde motion were instantaneous, as Cajetan believes, the day would only be five hours longer than usual; (Menochius) but if otherwise, it would be ten; as the sun would occupy five hours in going back, and as many to regain its former station. (Tirinus) --- Usher supposes that the night was as much shortened, that so astronomical observations may still be verified without any confusion. But that would introduce a fresh miracle. Some assert that only the shadow went back, without any derangement in the heavenly bodies. Spinosa laughs at the ignorance of those people, who mistook the effects of a parhelion for a miracle. This author may boast of his superior knowledge. But how came the sages of Babylon (ver. 12.) to be unacquainted with such a natural cause? How came it so opportunely (Calmet) at the time appointed by the prophet? What improbable explanations are not those forced to admit, who deny to the Almighty the power of changing his own works! (Haydock) --- The silence of profane historians respecting this miracle, is of little consequence. Herodotus (ii. 142.) seems to hint at it, as well as at that under Josue; (x.) being informed "by the Egyptians, that during 10340 years, the sun had risen four times in an extraordinary manner. It had risen twice where it ought naturally to set, and had set as often where it should rise." He might have said more simply, that the sun had twice gone back. See Solin, 45. (Calmet) --- St. Dion. Areop. ep. 7. ad Polycarp. --- This last author thinks that this day was twenty hours longer than usual, supposing that the lines designate so many hours, and that the sun kept going back for ten hours. (Worthington)'
      v:011:
        - '2KI:20:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Dial.</i> Hebrew also, "steps." St. Jerome confesses that he followed Symmachus in Isaias xxxviii. 7. Whether this dial resembled one of ours, (Grotius) or was made in the form of steps, (St. Cyril, hom. 3, in Isaias, &c.) or rather of a half globe, (Calmet) after the Babylonian fashion, (Vitruvius ix. 9.) is not clear. Some have asserted that hours were not known to the Hebrews, before the captivity. (Usher, the year of the world 3291.) --- But Toby[Tobias], (xii. 22.) who wrote at Nineve, under the reign of Manasses, clearly speaks of them. The Egyptians pretend that they invented water hour-glasses. But the invention of dials is attributed to the Chaldeans, from whom Anaximander introduced them among the Greeks, under the reign of Cyrus. He died in the year of the world 3457. --- <i>Achaz</i> had much to do with Theglathphalasar; (chap. xvii. 8.) and probably obtained this curiosity from the same country. In more ancient times, people measured time by the length of their shadow, and were invited to a feast at such a foot, in the same manner as we should invite for such an hour.

He was one of the three most excellent kings of Juda, (Haydock) and might be said to be the last; as those who followed were displaced at pleasure by Egypt, &c. (Du Hamel)'

It is not certain that there was such an officer as scribe of the temple; but the king's secretary was ordered by Joas to take an account of the money contributed, chap. xii. 10. (Calmet) --- Josias followed the same plan. (Tirinus)"

        - '2KI:22:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>The book of the law,</i> (that is, Deuteronomy.; Challoner.; St. Chrysostom, hom. 9. in Matthew) or the Pentateuch. (Josephus) --- Achaz, Manasses, and Amon, had burnt (R. Solomon) as many copies as they could, (Haydock) but some zealous priests had concealed this copy, in a box, in the wall of the temple, (Lyranus) or in the treasury adjoining it. The very hand writing of Moses, containing the record of the covenant, (or the 28, 29, 30, and 31st chapters of Deuteronomy) which was placed in (Calmet) or beside the ark, was now happily discovered. (Haydock) --- It seems it had been misplaced, as the ark itself had been removed, 2 Paralipomenon xxiv. 14., and xxxv. 3. This venerable monument, and the dreadful menaces which it denounced, made the deepest impression upon all, as we should read the autographs of St. Matthew, &c., with far greater respect and emotion than we do the printed copies. It is not at all probably that all the books of Scripture had been destroyed, as there were always some religious souls in both kingdoms; and if some kings had already made the impious attempt, (Haydock) of which, however, they are never accused in Scripture, they would not have been able to carry their malicious designs into effect. Josias had, before his 18th year, made many excellent regulations, conformably to the law, which was well understood, and carefully preserved by the priests and prophets, (Calmet) 2 Paralipomenon xvii. 9. --- <i>Read it.</i> Scribes were generally chosen from among the Levites.

But he probably resided at Anathoth. Sophonias appeared, perhaps, only towards the end of the reign of Josias. (Calmet) --- <i>The Second,</i> a street, or part of the city so called; in Hebrew, <i>Massem.</i> (Challoner) --- The Septuagint retain this word, (Menochius) or rather, "in Masena;" Hebrew <i>mishne.</i> (Haydock) --- Manasses inclosed Jerusalem with a second wall, (2 Paralipomenon xxxiii. 14.; Calmet) unless this was done by his father, 2 Paralipomenon xxxii. 5. (Tirinus) --- Here Holda is said to have kept a school. (Calmet) --- Chaldean, "the house of doctrine," a place next in importance to the temple.

      v:003: '2KI:22:3 | 3 | 3 | And in the eighteenth year of {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}king Josias, the king sent Saphan, the son of Aslia, the son of Messulam, the scribe of the temple of the Lord, saying to him:'
      v:004: '2KI:22:4 | 4 | 4 | Go to Helcias, the high priest, that the money may be put together which is brought into the temple of the Lord, which the door-keepers of the temple have gathered of the people.'
      v:005: '2KI:22:5 | 5 | 5 | And let it be given to the workmen by the overseers of the house of the Lord: and let them distribute it to those that work in the temple of the Lord, to repair the temple:'
      v:006: '2KI:22:6 | 6 | 6 | That is, to carpenters and masons, and to such as mend breaches: and that timber may be bought, and stones out of the quarries, to repair the temple of the Lord.'

      v:009: '2KI:22:9 | 9 | 9 | And Saphan, the scribe, came to the king, and brought him word again concerning that which he had commanded, and said: Thy servants have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the Lord: and they have given it to be distributed to the workmen, by the overseers of the works of the temple of the Lord.'
      v:010: '2KI:22:10 | 10 | 10 | And Saphan, the scribe, told the king, saying: Helcias, the priest, hath delivered to me a book. And when Saphan had read it before the king,'
      v:011: '2KI:22:11 | 11 | 11 | And the king had heard the words of the law of the Lord, he rent his garments.'
      v:012: "2KI:22:12 | 12 | 12 | And he commanded Helcias, the priest, and Ahicam, the son of Saphan, and Achobor, the son of Micha, and Saphan, the scribe, and Asaia, the king's servant, saying:"
      v:013: '2KI:22:13 | 13 | 13 | Go and consult the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Juda, concerning the words of this book which is found: for the great wrath of the Lord is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book, to do all that is written for us.'
      v:014: '2KI:22:14 | 14 | 14 | So Helcias, the priest, and Ahicam, and Achobor, and Saphan, and Asaia, went to Holda, the prophetess, the wife of Sellum, the son of Thecua, the son of Araas, keeper of the wardrobe, who dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second: and they spoke to her.'
      v:015: '2KI:22:15 | 15 | 15 | And she said to them: Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me:'

      v:020: '2KI:22:20 | 20 | 20 | Therefore I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy sepulchre in peace; that thy eyes may not see all the evils which I will bring upon this place.'

Here the pagans burnt their children in honour of Moloch. See 3 Kings xv. 13., and 2 Paralipomenon xxix. 16., and xxx. 14. --- <i>Bethel,</i> out of contempt for the golden calf, (Haydock) and to remove those impurities to a greater distance. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - '2KI:23:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Soothsayers.</i> Protestants, "the idolatrous priests." Grotius thinks that camilli, or "ministers of the gods," (Serv.[Servius?] and Varro. vi.) may be derived from the Hebrew <i>hacemarim,</i> "the black-vested," or cryers. The Rabbins give this title in derision to the religious of the Christian Church. There were some <i>melanophori,</i> or people "in black," who honoured Isis, or the moon, by this dress; as if to condole with her on the absence of the sun. Plutarch Apuleius describes a shining black veil, which was carried in the procession of her statue. --- <i>Baal.</i> Hebrew, "to Baal the son;" (Calmet) or rather, "to Baal, to the son." (Haydock) --- People are divided whether they were one and the same idol. The Hebrew <i>mazatoth,</i> (Calmet) Septuagint <em>Mazour</em><em>ó</em><em>th</em> (Haydock) is not better understood. St. Jerome translates <i>signs</i> of the zodiac; others have, influences, planets, Lucifer, Venus, &c. Job (xxxviii. 32.) designates some stars by the name of Mozruth, and Mozrim. (Calmet)'
      v:006:

Jeremias (xix. 11.) threatens the people of Jerusalem with such a burial. (Calmet) --- The <i>common people</i> here means the idolaters, 2 Paralipomenon xxxiv. 4. (Haydock)'

See Deuteronomy xxiii. 18., and 3 Kings xv. 12., and 2 Machabees vi. 4. These men prostituted themselves (Menochius) even in that sacred place. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "he broke down the houses of the Sodomites, that were by the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the grove." These hangings, tents, or dwellings, (Haydock) were destined for the idol; (Syriac, &c.) or they were intended to hide the abominations which were committed. They were called "tents of the daughters," chap. xvii. 30. (Calmet) --- <i>For.</i> Literally, "of the grove:" <i>luci.</i> But the other translation is conformable to the Septuagint. (Vatable, &c.) (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - '2KI:23:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Bersabee;</i> to which the Israelites went in pilgrimages, Amos v. 5. This place was situated at the southern extremity of the dominions of Juda, as Gabaa was at the northern. The <i>priests</i> being unable to offer sacrifice in the temple, and desirous to gain a livelihood, had been so weak as to conform to the illegal practices of the country; though they seem to have intended to worship <i>God,</i> Deuteronomy xii. 11. --- <i>Altars.</i> These might also be consecrated to the true God, but they were forbidden. There were others, placed in similar situations, in honour of Trivia, or the moon, Isaias lvii. 8., and lxv. 11. (Calmet) --- <i>City,</i> to a person entering.

        - '2KI:23:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Brethren.</i> Thus people are degraded in the Christian Church, that they may suffer some confusion (Calmet) in this world, and repent. (Haydock) --- The priests, who had offered sacrifice unlawfully, where only permitted to perform the minor offices; but provision was made for their support, that they might not be tempted to relapse, Leviticus xxi. 17, 22., and Ezechiel xliv. 10. (Calmet) --- They were reduced to the rank of Levites. (Menochius)'
      v:010:
        - "2KI:23:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Defiled,</i> or declared it unlawful. (Menochius) --- <i>Topheth</i> may signify \"a drum;\" which the Jews say the idolaters beat, to prevent their childrens' cries from being heard, when they were burning in the arms of Moloch. St. Jerome interprets it \"latitude,\" as the vale was very wide, and beautifully adorned with gardens and springs. It formed a part of the vale of Josaphat and of Cedron; (Calmet) or the same valley went by these different names, as well as (Haydock) by that of <i>Geh-hinnon,</i> \"the vale of Ennom,\" whence Gehenna is formed, and applied to hell, Matthew v. 22., and Mark ix. 44., &c. (Calmet) --- Yet some think that the term denotes a place of torment on earth, which those deserve who say, <i>thou fool.</i> (Haydock)"

(Haydock) --- <i>Pharurim,</i> \"the suburbs.\" (Vatable) (Menochius) (Chaldean) --- It perhaps denotes the guard-house. See 1 Paralipomenon xxvi. 18. --- <i>Chariots.</i> The aforesaid horses were designed to draw them in honour of the sun. Some nations used to ride in this manner with all expedition, at its rising; and the Rabbins pretend that the king, or some other by his order, had been accustomed to ride from the eastern gate of the temple to the house of the governor, Nathan-melech. The horse was consecrated to the sun, on account of its agility.{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Placat equo Persis radiis Hyperiona cinctum,</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Ne detur celeri victima tarda Deo.</i> (Ovid, Fast. i.){JOIN}The Persians sacrificed the horse to the sun, that a slow victim may not be offered to the swift deity. The sun gives vigour to the whole material system, as the instrumental cause in the hand of God; and horses perceive the influence, more particularly in the warmer climates, and exult in their strength, Job xxxix. 21. (Haydock) --- Perhaps these horses had been destined for sacrifice by the infidel kings of Juda, as well as the chariots. (Calmet) --- The Rhodeans threw some into the sea every year. (Festus.) --- Others think that what Josias took away, was only engraven, or, that the horses had been set at liberty for superstitious observations, as was customary among the pagans. (Tacitus, Mor. Germ.) (Suetonius, in Julio)"

(Haydock) --- We are assured that the Arabs also adored the sun, and offered incense to it on the tops of their houses. The prophets often upbraid the people with this practice, Jeremias xix. 13., and Sophonias i. 5. (Calmet) --- It is wonderful that Ezechias had not before removed these remnants of his father's infidelity; and still more that <i>Manasses,</i> after his repentance, had not destroyed what he had unlawfully erected in the <i>courts</i> of the priests and of the people. But Amon might have restored them. --- <i>Ran.</i> This shews the zeal of the king. Hebrew and Septuagint, \"and thence he broke <i>or</i> tore them.\""
      v:013:
        - '2KI:23:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Offence;</i> Olivet. (Haydock) --- In the original, the terms are very much alike; and the Jews take a pleasure in deforming names, for which they had a horror. Solomon had erected temples here to various idols, (3 Kings xi. 7.) which had probably been demolished by Ezechias, but had been rebuilt under Amon, &c., and subsisted during the minority of Josias; (Calmet) or they had been neglected by the pious kings of Juda, as no longer dangerous. But Josias, in the fervour of his zeal, thought proper to remove every thing that had been the occasion of <i>offence:</i> Hebrew, "of corruption." --- <i>Idol,</i> and <i>scandal,</i> and <i>abomination,</i> are the same in Hebrew.'
      v:014:
        - '2KI:23:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Statues</i> is more proper than the Protestant "images," which would rather be torn. --- <i>Dead</i> is not expressed in the Hebrew or Septuagint, but must be understood.

      v:015:
        - "2KI:23:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Bethel</i> had perhaps fallen into the hands of Juda, after the Israelites had been led away. (Calmet) --- Josias exercised the like authority throughout all Samaria, (ver. 19.) as the country properly belonged to the house of David, and was God's peculiar inheritance. (Haydock) --- We may, therefore conclude that He authorized Josias to act in this manner; and the new inhabitants had no interest in maintaining the superstition of those who had lived there before them. The priest sent by Asarhaddon, had taken up his residence at Bethel; whence it is inferred that the town, at that time, was in the hands of the Samaritans, (Calmet) as it might be still, though Josias might exercise dominion in it as lord paramount.

(Calmet) --- But thus both prophets would be identified. It would rather appear that the seducing <i>prophet,</i> who resided at Bethel, is here said to have <i>come out of Samaria,</i> though that place was not raised to the dignity of a royal city (Haydock) till 50 years afterwards. (Calmet) --- There might be a town there long before; and, at any rate, he belonged to the kingdom of Jeroboam, or of Samaria. (Haydock) --- His faith in the prophet's prediction was, perhaps, thus rewarded, (Menochius) as his bones were left unmolested, on account of their being buried in the same sepulchre with the man of God.

Herodotus (ii. 159.) says, that Nechos gained a victory over the Syrians at Magdolum, and took Cadytis, which is probably Cades, a strong city of Galilee, though some take it to be Jerusalem, as it may be interpreted \"the holy city.\" (Calmet) --- Mageddo is called Magdala in the Greek, and Magedan in other copies, and in the Vulgate, Matthew xv. 39."

God therefore withdrew him from the sight of the miseries which were shortly to fall on his devoted people, chap. xxii. 20. (Haydock) --- He was a prince of most excellent disposition, and receives the highest encomium, ver. 25., and Ecclesiasticus xlix. 1. Jeremias composed his funeral canticle, which was sung on his anniversary for many years, 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 24. The mourning for this pious king became proverbial, and resembled that which should be made for the Messias, Zacharias xii. 11. The life and death of Josias prefigured those of Jesus Christ; who should be long expected as the restorer of the true religion, the teacher of a more excellent law, and the most innocent victim for the sins of the people. The glorious Phase under Josias, was but a faint representation of the eucharistic sacrifice. (Calmet)'

(Calmet) --- Having placed a garrison in it, he was met by Joachaz, and gained a victory over him at Rebla, (Haydock) as Sanctius gathers from Ezechiel xix. 4. Hence he treated the captive king with such severity, and sent him into Egypt to die in chains, Jeremias xxii. 11. Joachaz is called Sellum (in Jeremias) and Jechonias, 3 Esdras i. 34.

(Tirinus) --- Joakim obeyed for 3 <i>years.</i> --- <i>Then again.</i> Hebrew, \"he turned and rebelled.\" This was the first time, as he had before been subject to Egypt, and was attacked on that account.

      v:005: '2KI:24:5 | 5 | 5 | But the rest of the acts of Joakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? And Joakim slept with his fathers:'

      v:007: '2KI:24:7 | 7 | 7 | And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his own country: for the king of Babylon had taken all that had belonged to the king of Egypt, from the river of Egypt, unto the river Euphrates.'
      v:008: '2KI:24:8 | 8 | 8 | Joachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Nohesta, the daughter of Elnathan, of Jerusalem.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '2KI:25:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Day,</i> the 30th of January, the year of the world 3414. (Usher) --- Some time after Nabuchodonosor left the siege, to attack the Egyptians; (Jeremias xxxvii. 3.) and the people of Jerusalem, (Haydock) supposing that he would return no more, took back their slaves, whom Jeremias had prevailed on them to liberate, according to the law, during the sabbatical year, Jeremias xxxiv. 8. (Usher) --- The prophet reproached them for it; and announced the destruction of the city so plainly, that he was thrown into prison, Jeremias xxi., and xxxiv., and xxxviii. --- <i>It.</i> The Babylonians had already taken all the towns of Juda, except Azeca and Lachis, Jeremias xxxiv. 7. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - '2KI:25:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Of the.</i> Protestants supply, "<i>fourth</i> month," as it is in the parallel passage, Jeremias lii. 6., <i>And in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month.</i> In Jeremias xxxix. 2., we read, <i>in the fourth month, the fifth day of the month, the city was broken up,</i> or a breach was made in the outer wall. In the course of a few days, the <i>princes</i> of Babylon seized <i>the middle gate;</i> and the famine became so intolerable, that, on the 9th, it was judged expedient to abandon the city. (Haydock) --- During this siege it is thought, (Calmet) that mothers eat their children, (Lamentations iv. 10., and Baruch ii. 3.) and children their parents, Ezechiel v. 10. (Menochius)'
      v:004:
        - '2KI:25:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Walls,</i> by a subterraneous passage, to the plains of Jericho; (Rabbins) or by the horse gate, which was the most private, and, it seems, had been walled up, Ezechiel xii. 12. (Menochius)'
      v:006:
        - '2KI:25:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Rablatha,</i> the Antioch of Syria, (St. Jerome) which was styled also Epiphania, (Tirinus) or more probably Apamea, where Nabuchodonosor was, when Jerusalem was taken. --- <i>Upon him,</i> by the advice of his council, Jeremias xxxix. 3, 13. Syriac, "they made him answer the charges brought against him," (Calmet) of ingratitude and rebellion, as he had been appointed by the king of Babylon, and had sworn to be faithful to him. (Menochius) --- This repeated infidelity made Nabuchodonosor resolve to remove the people from their own country. (Calmet) --- He sentenced the last of the kings of Juda to see his children slain, (Haydock) to have his eyes put out, and to remain in prison till his death, Jeremias lii. 11., &c. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, he "spake judgments with him." Thus was accomplished the prediction of Jeremias, (xxxiv. 3.) "thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak to thee." (Watson) --- The same prophet had said the same (Jeremias xxxii. 4.) before he was thrown into prison. The sight of an angry judge is no small punishment. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - '2KI:25:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Eyes;</i> after they had been excruciated by the sight of his slaughtered children. He thus might be convinced, that there was no reason to despise the predictions of Jeremias and of Ezechiel, (xii. 13.) as contradictory, because the latter informed him that he should not <i>see</i> Babylon; though the other said that he should <i>die</i> there. --- <i>Babylon,</i> where he was honourably buried, by order of Nabuchodonosor. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] x. 11.) --- Seder (Olam xxviii.) records that his attendants sung, at his funeral, "Alas! king Sedecias is dead, having drunk the dregs of all ages;" as he suffered also for the crimes of his predecessors. (Genebrard) (Tirinus) --- This is not indeed specified in Scripture: (Haydock) but it is highly probable that Nabuchodonosor would thus "revere royalty, even in its ruins," if Daniel and the other Jews in power, had not been careful to shew this mark of respect to their deceased monarch, conformably to the prediction of Jeremias; (xxxiv. 3.) who foretold that he should die, not by a violent death, the usual fate of captive kings, but <i>in peace,</i> or on his bed, though in a prison. (Watson, let. 6.)'
      v:008:
        - '2KI:25:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Seventh.</i> Jeremias (lii. 12.) mentions the <i>tenth;</i> on which day Nabuzardan probably arrived, or begun to put his orders in execution. Yet the Jews keep the ninth as an annual fast, Zacharias vii. 3., and viii. 19. The temple was destroyed on Saturday, 27th August, the year of the world 3416, (Usher) after it had stood 424 years, 3 months, and 8 days. (Calmet) --- <i>Army.</i> Hebrew, "of those who slay;" which may be fitly understood "of soldiers," as well as "of cooks," (Septuagint) "butchers." (Pagnin, &c.) (Menochius)'
      v:009:
        - "2KI:25:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Great.</i> This word is supplied from Jeremias lii. 13., and Hebrew, \"great <i>man's</i> house.\" (Protestants) But Jeremias xxxix. 8., we read, they <i>burnt the houses of the people,</i> (Haydock) even the meanest, destroyed the walls, and took the people to Babylon, only leaving some countrymen to cultivate the land. Jeremias was set at liberty by Nabuzardan, (ibid. xi.[Jeremias xxxix. 9.?]) and chose to continue with this <i>remnant of the people,</i> for their comfort and direction. (Haydock) --- They applied to him to know whether they should retire into Egypt; and after ten days, he gave them God's injunction to the contrary: but they despised it, Jeremias xlii. 7., and xliii. 1. The prophet, and his secretary, Baruch, followed them into Egypt. Thus was the country abandoned, and the monarchy at an end, after it had subsisted 468 years from the commencement of David's reign. (Calmet) --- Yet some little power remained in the family of David, even at Babylon; (ver. 27.) and the Jewish affairs were re-established, after the captivity, though not in such splendour as formerly, nor always under princes of the same royal family. (Haydock)"
      v:014:
        - '2KI:25:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Mazers.</i> Hebrew <i>yahim,</i> "shovels." (Protestants) Septuagint retain the original word, which St. Jerome translates differently. See 3 Kings vii. 50., (Menochius) and Exodus.'
      v:018:
        - '2KI:25:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Saraias,</i> father of Esdras, and of Josedeck, who succeeded in the Pontificate, 1 Esdras vii. 1., and 1 Paralipomenon vi. 14. (Tirinus) --- <i>Sophonias.</i> He was perhaps chief of the fourth band of door-keepers, mentioned [in] 1 Paralipomenon ix. 17, 24., and vice-gerent of the High-priest, to supply his place, in case of any accident. We find no mention of such a priest in the law, but Eleazar possessed a similar power, Numbers iii. 32. (Calmet) --- <i>Keepers.</i> These seem to have concealed themselves in the temple. (Menochius) --- They were punished, as the counsellors of Sedecias, by being beheaded or crucified, Lamentations v. 12. (Tirinus)'
      v:019:
        - '2KI:25:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Eunuch.</i> Protestants, "officer." (Haydock) --- <i>Five.</i> Arabic and Jeremias lii. 25., read <i>seven,</i> as two were probably discovered afterwards, (Calmet) or had fled. (Du Hamel) --- These were chief officers. --- <i>Sopher.</i> Septuagint, "and the secretary of the general." Syriac, "the secretary and chiefs of the armies." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "the principal scribe." (Haydock) --- It is not clear whether the general have this title of <i>sopher,</i> "scribe," himself; or it rather designates his secretary, or scribe, Judges viii. 14. (Calmet) --- Many date the 70 years captivity from the last year of Joachin. (Du Hamel)'
      v:022:
        - '2KI:25:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Godolias.</i> The Rabbins say that he had gone over to the Chaldeans: Jeremias (xxxviii. 2, 17.) had advised all to do so, and Godolias was of an easy complying disposition. (Grotius) --- But God did not suffer him to collect the remnants of his unhappy people, (Calmet) at least for any long time, as he was slain by Ismael, (Jeremias xl. 12., and xli. 1.; Haydock) who probably envied his dignity. (Josephus) (Salien)'
      v:026:
        - '2KI:25:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Chaldees.</i> They went under the conduct of Johanan, in opposition to the declaration of Jeremias, xliii. 7., and xliv. 1. (Calmet)'
      v:027:
        - "2KI:25:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Twentieth.</i> Jeremias (lii. 31.) says <em>the</em> 25<em>th,</em> when Nabuchodonosor was buried, and (Du Hamel) the decree was made, though it was not put in execution till two days later. (Calmet) --- <i>Evilmerodach,</i> whose proper name was Baltassar, (Daniel v. 1.; Tirinus) or the latter was his son. The Jews say that he had been confined in prison, with Joachin, because he had not administered the kingdom well, during the seven years' illness of his father Nabuchodonosor. Berosus (apud Josephus, contra Apion 1., and Eusebius, præp. ix. 40., who cites also Megasthenes) informs us that he reigned with insolence during two years, when he was treacherously murdered by his father-in-law, Neriglissor."
      v:028:
        - '2KI:25:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Kings,</i> who had been made captives. Adonibezec had 70, Judges i. 7. Alexander kept Porus and Taxilus at his court, as Cyrus had done [to] Crœsus, whom he treated with great distinction. The prosperity of Joachin does not seem to have been of long continuance, as his benefactor did not reign above two (ver. 27.) or three years, Daniel. viii. 1.'
      v:030:
        - '2KI:25:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>His life,</i> may be referred to Evilmerodach, unless Joachin was involved in his disgrace, and perished at the same time. Perhaps the king of Juda did not always eat at the table of Evilmerodach, but received his meat from it, as was customary. (Syriac, &c.) (Calmet) --- He received all that was necessary to support his household, daily. (Grotius) --- In Jeremias lii. 34., <i>until the day of his death,</i> seems to be an useless "tautology," which is omitted here, and in "our oldest manuscript," says Kennicott; who observes that whoever will compare these passages, "will find many variations, and some corruptions." But most of them may be easily explained, ver. 3, 8, 27, &c. (Haydock)'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "This Book brings us to the conclusion of the kingdom of Israel, (chap. xvii.) and to the captivity of Juda, at Babylon, chap. xxv. We behold some virtuous princes reigning over the two tribes [of Juda and Benjamin], while the ten were uniformly governed by men of perverse morals. (Worthington) --- Yet there were some who adhered to the Lord in both kingdoms. David and his descendants (Haydock) occupy the throne near 480 years; and, after the captivity, continue in some degree of honour till the coming of Christ. (Worthington) --- But various families rule over Israel; some by usurpation, (Haydock) others by God's appointment: who thus chooses to chastise the wicked. He still watches over his Church, and sends his prophets for the instruction of all. (Worthington) --- We have enquired in the preface of the former Book, who composed this. (Haydock) --- The kingdom of Israel subsists about 250, (Worthignton) or 254 years. This Book contains the transactions of 308 years. (Calmet) --- But the chronology is extremely perplexed. To the sixth year of Ezechias, when Israel was led away captive, the kingdom of Juda seems to have lasted 260, and that of Israel only 241 years, though they both commenced at the same period. The errors regard the kings of Isreal, according to Houbigant, who would assign the following years to the respective kings of Juda and of Israel. <b>1.</b> Of Juda: Solomon, 40; Roboam, 17; Abiam, 3; Asa, 41, Josaphat, 25; Joram, 8; Ochozias, 1; (the same is said to have begun to reign in the preceding year, the 11th of Joram, 4 Kings ix. 29, incorrectly) Athalia, 6; Joas, 40; Amasias, 29p; (he reigns 15 after the death of Joas, king of Isreal) Azarias, 52; Joatham, 16; Achaz, 16; Ezechias, 6; in which year, the three hundredth from the commencement of Solomon's reign, and the two hundred and sixtieth of the kingdom of Juda, Samaria was taken. <b>2.</b> The kings of Israel: Jeroboam, 22; Nadab, 2; Baasa, 24; Ela, 2; Zambri, 7 <i>days;</i> Amri, 12; Achab, 22; Ochozias, 2; Joram, 12; Jehu, 28; Joachaz, 17; Joas, 16; Jeroboam, 41; Zacharias, 10½; (in the text 10 is omitted.; Haydock) Sellum, 1 <i>month;</i> Manahem, 10; Phaceia, 2; Phacee, 30; (in the text, 20.; Haydock) Osee, 9; in all, 261½ years, (Houbigant, Chron. Sac.) or 261 years and 7 months. The variation of 19 months, which still appears, may be owing to some of the years being incomplete. (Haydock) --- <b>3.</b> After a reign of 28 years over Juda, Ezechias is succeeded by Manasses, who reigns 55: Amon, 2; Josias, 31; Joachaz, a few months; Eliacim, or Joakim, 11; Joachin, Conias, or Jechonias, had reigned ten years with his father. After three months and ten days reigning alone, he is led away to Babylon with part of the people. Matthanias, or Sedecias, is appointed in his stead; but proving refractory, is also, after nine years, deprived of his sight, and conducted with 832 of his subjects to Babylon. Nabuchodonosor had already led away 3023, under Joachin. After the death of Godolias, who was left to govern the miserable remains of the people, the year of the world 3417, he made 745 more captives, and thus an end was put to the kingdom of Juda. The scourge had been retarded for some time, by the repentance of Manasses, and the prayers of the prophets. (Calmet)"
