    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "1TH:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Paul.</i> It is observed that St. Paul never calls himself an <i>apostle</i> in either of the epistles to the Thessalonians. The reason why he deviates from his ordinary custom on this occasion, probably is, that joining his name with the other two, he did not like to assume a title, though his due, which the others did not possess. (Estius) --- Such condescension to your neighbours' feelings, even in trifles, is highly delicate and praiseworthy. (Haydock)"
      v:003:
        - '1TH:1:3 | 3 | 3 | The apostle praises the Thessalonians for the progress they had made in the theological virtues [of faith, hope, and charity], and enumerates the profit they had derived from each. Their <i>faith</i> had produced <i>works;</i> their <i>charity</i> rendered their <i>labour</i> light and easy, and their <i>patience</i> was the fruit of their future hopes, in confidence of which they bore what they had to suffer from their unconverted countrymen. (Estius)'
      v:005:
        - '1TH:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>In power.</i> The sense is, I have preached the gospel to you, not only in words of persuasion, but have proved it by the power of miracles, in much fulness, or in great abundance. I have also taught you the gospel not by my words only, but by my actions; for you know what kind of a life I led among you. I had no interest but in gaining your souls. And I rejoice to hear you have received it in much power, by the Holy Ghost working within you. (Haydock) --- <i>And in much fulness.</i>[1] Some would have the Greek word to signify in a full assurance; but in the style of the New Testament, it may as well signify a fulness, or plenitude. (Witham)'
      v:008:
        - '1TH:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>From you was spread abroad the word.</i>[2] The Greek, <i>was sounded about.</i> --- <i>In every place.</i> In very many places. (Witham)'

      v:005: '1TH:1:5 | 5 | 5 | For our gospel hath not been to you in word only, but in power also, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much fulness, as you know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes.'
      v:006: '1TH:1:6 | 6 | 6 | And you became followers of us, and of the Lord: receiving the word in much tribulation, with the joy of the Holy Ghost:'
      v:007: '1TH:1:7 | 7 | 7 | So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia, and in Achaia.'
      v:008: '1TH:1:8 | 8 | 8 | For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but also in every place, your faith which is towards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to speak any thing.'
      v:009: '1TH:1:9 | 9 | 9 | For they themselves relate of us, what manner of entrance we had unto you: and how you were converted to God from idols, to serve the living and true God.'
      v:010: '1TH:1:10 | 10 | 10 | And to wait for his Son from heaven, (whom he raised up from the dead) Jesus, who hath delivered us from the wrath to come.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1TH:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Vain.</i> Our entrance among you was not in <i>vain</i> fables, or lies; our preaching was not in trifles: (Œcumenius) or rather was not without fruit. Others have spoken of it every where; but why refer you to others when yourselves know that it was every where followed by abundance of good works, faith, patience? &c. (Estius)'
      v:003:
        - '1TH:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Our exhortation was not</i> proceeding from <i>error.</i>[1] That is, was not by promoting errors, or uncleanness. (Witham)'
      v:004:
        - '1TH:2:4 | 4 | 4 | As we were approved of and chosen by God to announce his gospel, we have tried to correspond with his designs; and we speak in a spirit of disinterestedness, not to please men, but God. Being chosen by God, it is to him we must render an account. Have we spoken to you in words of flattery? Have we disguised the gospel truth, or concealed its austerity? Have we made piety a cloak for avarice? &c. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 1TH:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Nor taken an occasion of covetousness.</i> Not so as to make the gospel a cloak for gain-sake. (Witham)
      v:007:
        - '1TH:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>But we became little,</i>[2] by our carriage, and by our humility and kindness. In the Greek, made ourselves gentle, good natured, &c. (Witham)'
      v:008:
        - '1TH:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Because you were become most dear to us.</i> Literally, <i>desiring you.</i>[3] St. Chrysostom admires the tender expressions of love in St. Paul. (Witham)'
      v:010:
        - '1TH:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>You are witnesses.</i> We must necessarily conclude that the apostle speaks this not from vain glory, or personal vanity; but in the just right of defending his own character against the aspersions of enemies, and lest the faith of any might be staggered by the calumnies. In such cases self-praise is not only lawful, but frequently an imperative duty, if confined within the limits of truth. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - '1TH:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>The word</i>[4] <i>of the hearing of God,</i> which can only signify the word of God you heard from us. (Witham)'
      v:016:
        - "1TH:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>To full up</i> the measure of <i>their sins,</i> after which God's justice would punish them. (Witham) --- The Jews filled up the measure of their iniquities by the opposition they every where manifested to the religion of Christ. The earliest Fathers of the Church testify that they dispersed people into every nation to blaspheme the name of Christ; and hence sprang the evil fame which Christians bore among the pagans. See the apologies of St. Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Origen, &c. --- <i>For the wrath of God is come upon them to the end.</i> It seems a foretelling of their entire destruction, which happened not long after under Vespasian and Adrian. (Witham)"
      v:017:
        - '1TH:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Being taken away from</i>[5] <i>you.</i> Literally, <i>become desolate,</i> because of our separation from you. (Witham)'
      v:018:
        - '1TH:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Satan hindered us.</i> That is, has raised such an aversion to me among the pagans and Jews of Thessalonica, that my friends do not think it safe I should come among you. I am now detained from you by violence; but when this life is past, you shall form my joy and my crown. I will present you at the tribunal of my Saviour, and say: Behold me and my children; behold the fruits of my labours, the proofs of my fidelity, and my claims for a recompense. (Calmet) --- If the apostle here calls his disciples his hope, joy, glory, why may we not call the blessed Virgin Mary, or other saints, their joy and hope, for the special confidence they have in their prayers?'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1TH:4:1 | 1 | 1 | In this chapter the apostle begins to remind them of their obligation of always striving to increase in virtue. Though he praises them through the whole epistle, he still thinks it necessary to warn them not to be surprised in uncleanness. He repeats what he had taught them before; first, that there is vengeance awaiting the workers of evil; and secondly, that the favour of God is the reward of those who deal with the brethren in simplicity, and preserve themselves from the defilements of the Gentiles. (St. Ambrose, Comment., on this place)'
      v:004:
        - '1TH:4:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>His vessel.</i> That is, his own body. See 1 Kings xxi. 5. (Witham)'
      v:006:
        - '1TH:4:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>That no man overreach, nor deceive his brother in business.</i>[1] The Protestant and Mr. N. even in their translations, add, in <i>any</i> matter, because some expound it of frauds and circumventions in any kind of business. But this addition of <i>any,</i> should be left out, seeing the best interpreters expound it of a prohibition of adultery, and the injury thereby done to another, and of sins of that kind only, which is confirmed by what follows and what goes before. See St. Jerome in chap. iv. ad Ephes. tom. 4. p. 369.; St. Chrysostom serm. 3 on this place. Here, says he, he speaks of adultery, as before of fornication, &c. See Theodoret, Theophylactus, Estius, Menochius, Cornelius a Lapide, &c. (Witham)'
      v:011:
        - "1TH:4:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>And that you want nothing of any man's.</i>[2] This is the sense by the Greek, nor does the Latin here signify to <i>desire,</i> but to <i>want them that are without;</i> i.e. infidels out of the pale of the Church. (Witham) --- In regard of brotherly love, he advises them to remain quiet, at peace with every one, troubling nobody, nor interfering with the concerns of others, but each one minding his own work. It had been reported to the apostle that there were some at Thessalonica who made religion a pretest for idleness. It is to reprove such persons as these, that we are given to understand in this place that religion will never excuse the neglect of relative duties, either to our neighbours or to ourselves. It is the duty of all to labour, in order to prevent the evils of poverty; for involuntary poverty is a great snare, and a dangerous temptation against salvation. It exposes to ignorance, to meanness, and low actions; it conducts to fraud, to falsities, to impudence, and forgetfulness of God. Happy are the poor in spirit, but miserable they who are involuntarily so: miserable, not for the wants, the humiliations, or inconveniences of their state, but for the irregularities and disorders of conduct to which they are exposed. It is therefore wise of man to pray, Give me not riches nor poverty, but give me only what is sufficient, &c. (Calmet)"

(Witham) --- <i>Shall rise first.</i> Not in order of <i>time,</i> for all shall rise in the twinkling of an eye, but first in order of <i>dignity.</i> St. Chrysostom, however, thinks that the elect rise before the reprobate, to go before the Lord; whereas the latter shall come behind him, only to appear before the tribunal of justice.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '1TH:5:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Of the times and moments.</i> That is, of the day of judgment, of the end of the world, of the destruction of Jerusalem. It is enough to know the time is uncertain, and that death cometh as <i>a thief in the night.</i> (Witham) --- When the judgment shall take place the Angels themselves do not know. Perhaps St. Paul, when wrapt up to the third heaven, may have learnt something on this subject; for he was told many things which he could not announce to man; therefore, he says, I need not write to you: it is unnecessary for us to know it. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - '1TH:5:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Overtake you.</i> It is a subject of astonishment, that some people are so childishly afraid of the last day, that they cannot think of it without consternation, lest it should happen in their time. Weak souls! Do they not recollect that death will certainly overtake them, and that will be to them individually the end of the world, and the last day. The whole world then does perish as far as regards them. (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - '1TH:5:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>You are the children of light.</i> That is, there is little danger of thieves in the day time, when it is light. Also watch and have arms to defend you, the coat of mail of faith; the helmet of hope: you are under the protection of Christ, who died for you, and for your salvation. See St. Chrysostom, p. 293, &c. (Witham)'
      v:008:
        - "1TH:5:8 | 8 | 8 | The Christian's panoply is not faith alone, but faith, hope and charity, as we see here."
      v:010:
        - '1TH:5:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Whether we wake or sleep.</i> That is, whether we be of the number of those whom Jesus Christ shall find still upon earth, when he shall come to judgment, or among those who have slept and returned to dust, it is his will that we should be his. (Theodoret)'
      v:014:
        - '1TH:5:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Rebuke,</i> or correct <i>the unquiet.</i>[1] By the Greek, it signifies the <i>disorderly,</i> or those that keep no order. (Witham)'
      v:016:
        - '1TH:5:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Always rejoice.</i> It is usual for St. Paul to recommend joy to the faithful. Cheerfulness is indeed the characteristic of true virtue, which by no means consists in, nor encourages, sourness or moroseness, as some mistaken people imagine. God loves a cheerful giver. Sorrow, which is of this world, killeth. (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - '1TH:5:19 | 19 | 19 | Do not oppose either the interior gifts of the holy Spirit, which are his graces, nor his exterior gifts of prophecy, &c. Take the regular precautions of prudence, that you be not deceived by those who pretend to be inspired; but when satisfied that the inspiration comes from heaven, do not despise it. Be like good bankers, take the good coin, and reject the counterfeit. (St. Cyril of Alexandria)'
      v:021:
        - '1TH:5:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Prove all things.</i> That is, examine prophecies whether they be true, and the doctrine which you hear from new preachers, and refrain yourselves not only from evil, but from every thing that hath the appearance of evil, and which may disedify and scandalize others. (Witham) --- <i>Hold that which is good.</i> This we can best learn from the doctrine of the apostles, and the spirit of the Catholic Church. Men can deceive and be deceived, but the Spirit of God, speaking to us by his Church, can neither deceive us nor be deceived.'
      v:023:
        - '1TH:5:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Spirit, and soul.</i> The former marks the understanding, the latter the will: hence these two terms give the two principal faculties of the soul. (Bible de Vence)'

  - PREFACE.
  - "St. Paul having preached with success at Thessalonica, the chief city of Macedonia, wrote to them this letter, to confirm them in the Christian faith and in the practice of virtue. This, in order, is the first epistle of St. Paul. He wrote it about the year fifty-two[A.D. 52], as it is thought, from Corinth. (Witham) --- St. Paul having preached the gospel in this place, converted some Jews and a great number of Gentiles; but the unbelieving Jews, envying his success, raised such a commotion against him, that he and his companion Silvanus were obliged to quit the city. Afterwards he went to Athens, where he had heard that the converts in Thessalonica were under a severe persecution ever since his departure; and lest they should lose their fortitude, he sent Timothy to strengthen and comfort them in their sufferings. In the mean time St. Paul came to Corinth, where he wrote this first epistle and also the second to the Thessalonians, both in the same year, being the nineteenth after our Lord's ascension. (Challoner) --- St. Paul preached the faith in this city, assisted by Silas or Silvanus, whose name is joined with the apostle's in this letter. See Acts xvii. Being driven away from this city by the violence of the Jews, he left Timothy and Silas in Macedonia, to confirm the new converts in their faith. But having afterwards called them to him, and hearing of their constancy and perseverance, he writes this epistle to encourage them and praise them. It is the first in time of all St. Paul's epistles, and filled with the most affectionate expressions of love and tenderness for his spiritual children in Jesus Christ. In the latter part of the epistle, he gives some short instructions concerning the state of souls after death, and the coming of the last day; as his companions had informed him that strange reports concerning these two articles were in circulation at Thessalonica, to the disturbance of the faithful. (Calmet, Estius, and others.) --- The first three chapters are to confirm and comfort the Thessalonians against the temptations of persecution; the other two are to exhort them to live up to the precepts he delivers them."
