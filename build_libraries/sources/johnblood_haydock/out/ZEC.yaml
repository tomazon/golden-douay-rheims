    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'ZEC:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Barachias</i> adopted him, (1 Esdras v. 1.) or rather Addo was his grandfather.'
      v:002:
        - 'ZEC:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Angry,</i> as he has severely chastised them. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - "ZEC:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Turn ye.</i> Such expressions admonish us of our free-will, and when we answer, <i>convert us,</i> &c., (Lamentations v. 11.; Calmet) we confess that God's grace preventeth us. (Council of Trent, Session vi. 5.) (Worthington) --- We may <i>resist</i> the Holy Spirit, (Haydock) and reject his graces. The prophet exhorts the people to lay aside all former negligence, (Calmet) and proceed with the temple. (Haydock) --- It had been commenced about two months before, Aggeus ii. 1, 16."
      v:005:
        - "ZEC:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Always.</i> He seems to hint, that after Malachias prophets would be sent no more till Christ should appear; or, that God's word should be fulfilled (ver. 6.) though the prophets were dead. (Calmet)"
      v:006:
        - "ZEC:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Fathers.</i> They felt their effects. (Haydock) --- <i>Returned;</i> being converted by the sight of God's judgments, Osee iv. 1., and 2 Esdras i. 6."
      v:007:
        - 'ZEC:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Sabath.</i> These names were brought from Chaldea. The month was lunar, and corresponded sometimes with parts of our December and January, at other times with January, or with that and the following month. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - 'ZEC:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>A man.</i> An angel in the shape of a man. It was probably St. Michael, the guardian angel of the Church of God. (Challoner) --- It is plain that he was an angel, ver. 11. (Worthington) --- He appears in obscurity, to shew the distress of the nation. (Calmet) --- <i>Among.</i> Septuagint, "between two shady mountains." (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - 'ZEC:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>These are they,</i> &c. The guardian angels of provinces and nations. (Challoner) --- The Jews believed that each nation had such an angel, who had to give an account to one in higher authority. God proportions his revelation to their ideas.'
      v:011:
        - "ZEC:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Rest.</i> All the country under Michael's care enjoyed peace, (Calmet) in the second year of Darius. (Haydock) -- The <i>red horse</i> implies slaughter, Apocalypse vi. 4. It was now repressed. (Tournemine)"
      v:012:
        - "ZEC:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>The seventieth year;</i> viz., from the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem, in the ninth year of king Sedecias, to the second year of king Darius. These seventy years of the desolation of Jerusalem and the cities of Juda, are different from the seventy years of captivity foretold by Jeremias; which began in the fourth year of Joakim, and ended in the first year of king Cyrus. (Challoner) --- Of these Daniel (ix.) speaks. The temple had also been destroyed now seventy years, (Worthington) and the angel prays, (Haydock) while the prophet begs that the people may be inspired to rebuild it. (Worthington) --- Michael takes occasion from the angels' report, to beseech the Lord to perfect what had been so well begun. He speaks not expressly of the temple, as Aggeus had prevailed on the people to commence that edifice. They had excused themselves that <i>the time was not come,</i> as they probably dated from the burning of the temple; though its desolation began with the siege, thirty months before. See Jeremias xxv. 11., and xxix. 10. (Calmet)"
      v:013:
        - "ZEC:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Answered.</i> We have here a proof of the intercession of angel, and of its good effects. (Haydock) --- <i>In me;</i> revealing God's will. (St. Jerome) --- Yet it seems to be St. Michael, chap. iv. 1. (Chaldean; Theod.[Theodotion <i>or</i> Theodoret]) (Calmet)"
      v:014:
        - ZEC:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Zeal.</i> I will again treat her as my spouse. (Haydock)
      v:015:
        - 'ZEC:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Nations,</i> represented as four horns, ver. 18, 19. --- <i>Evil,</i> through malice, and thus deserve themselves to be punished, Osee i. 4.'
      v:016:
        - ZEC:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Line.</i> Soon after Nehemias came to rebuild the city. (Calmet)
      v:018:
        - "ZEC:1:18 | 18 | 18-20 | <i>Four horns,...four smiths.</i> The four horns represent the empires, or kingdoms, that persecute and oppress the people of God: the <i>four smiths</i> or carpenters (for <i>faber</i> may signify either) represent those whom God makes his instruments in bringing to nothing the power of persecutors. (Challoner) --- The Ammonites, &c., on the east, the Philistines on the west, the Idumeans and Egyptians on the south, and the Assyrians and Chaldeans on the north, had much molested God's people, and were therefore punished. (Worthington) --- The princes of Assyria and of Babylon, the kings of Persia and of Egypt, had all treated them ill; and these four empires have or will be destroyed by four chariots, (chap. vi. 1.) Nabopolassar, Cyrus, Alexander, and Antiochus, Daniel vii. 1., &c. St. Jerome, and many who usually follow him, understand the empires of the Chaldeans, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, to be designated by the horns, as the workmen mean the angels who have chastised those nations."
      v:021:
        - 'ZEC:1:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Every.</i> Hebrew, "at pleasure; none shall lift," &c. These kingdoms shall no longer prove formidable. (Calmet) --- <i>Fray,</i> or "terrify." Septuagint, "to sharpen them in their hands. The horns are nations," &c. (Haydock)'

      v:002: ZEC:1:2 | 2 | 2 | The Lord hath been exceeding angry with your fathers.
      v:003: 'ZEC:1:3 | 3 | 3 | And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Turn ye to me, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will turn to you, saith the Lord of hosts.'
      v:004: 'ZEC:1:4 | 4 | 4 | Be not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have cried, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Turn ye from your evil ways, and from your wicked thoughts; but they did not give ear, neither did they hearken to me, saith the Lord.'

      v:006: 'ZEC:1:6 | 6 | 6 | But yet my words, and my ordinances, which I gave in charge to my servants, the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned, and said: As the Lord of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our devices, <i>so</i> he hath done to us.'
      v:007: 'ZEC:1:7 | 7 | 7 | In the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is called Sabath, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying:'

      v:011: 'ZEC:1:11 | 11 | 11 | And they answered the angel of the Lord, that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said: We have walked through the earth, and behold all the earth is inhabited, and is at rest.'
      v:012: 'ZEC:1:12 | 12 | 12 | And the angel of the Lord answered, and said: O Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the cities of Juda, with which thou hast been angry? this is now the seventieth year.'

    commentary:
      v:003:
        - ZEC:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Another.</i> The angel who measured spoke to Michael. (Calmet)
      v:004:
        - 'ZEC:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Walls.</i> This must be understood of the spiritual Jerusalem, the Church of Christ. (Challoner) --- According to St. Augustine (in Psalm lxxi.) when the literal sense cannot be verified, we must have recourse to the thing prefigured; and thus what is here written, must be explained of the Church rather than of Jerusalem. (Worthington) --- A little before the fall of the latter, it was become so populous that the houses which had been built without the walls were enclosed. (Josephus, Jewish Wars vi. 6.) --- This multitude was a sort of pledge or figure of the crowds which should embrace the gospel.'
      v:005:
        - 'ZEC:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Fire,</i> to enlighten and protect it. Arms will be unnecessary, Micheas v. 10., and Isaias ii. 4. The Church shall enjoy peace.'

      v:008:
        - 'ZEC:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Glory.</i> After restoring you to your own country, and rebuilding your cities, I will punish your enemies. (Calmet) --- After they have enjoyed prosperity, they shall feel the reverse. Hebrew <i>Cabod,</i> (Haydock) means also "a burden."'
      v:009:
        - 'ZEC:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Prey.</i> Two years after this (Calmet) the Assyrians revolted, and seized Babylon. (Justin i.) --- They slew the useless women: but Zopyrus betrayed the place to Darius, who hung 3,000 of the principal inhabitants, and demolished the walls. (Herodotus iii. 150.; Usher, year of the world 3489.)'
      v:011:
        - 'ZEC:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Nations.</i> We know of none who embraced the Jewish law. But both the old and the new world submits to Christ. --- <i>Dwell.</i> St. Michael represents the Messias. The latter preached and wrought miracles among the Jews, which rendered them inexcusable, John xv. 24. (Calmet)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'ZEC:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Jesus,</i> or Josue, the son of Josedec, the high priest of that time. (Challoner) --- To him this literally refers. (Worthington) --- As high priest, he represented the nation, whom several calumniated to Darius, 1 Esdras iv., &c. God represses the adversary and adorns his people. It seems something has been done amiss, ver. 4. (Calmet) --- The high priest, (St. Jerome) or rather his sons, have married strangers. (Chaldean) (1 Esdras x. 18.) Many Fathers take Jesus for a figure of the Messias, covered with the sins of mankind. (Calmet) --- But the <i>Orient</i> (ver. 8) would not thus be promised unto him, (St. Jerome) unless we consider him also as high priest. --- <i>Satan.</i> Septuagint, "the devil;" the accuser and calumniator, Apocalypse xii. 10.'
      v:002:
        - 'ZEC:3:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>The Lord said.</i> This may refer to the angel, or to the Father and the Son, Psalm cix. Both are styled Jehovah. --- <i>Bread,</i> alluding to the nation, or to Jesus. Have not the suffered enough? (Amos iv. 11.) (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'ZEC:3:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Garments.</i> Negligences and sins. (Challoner) --- Jesus had neglected to urge the building of the temple, or to repress unlawful marriages, 1 Esdras viii. (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - 'ZEC:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Change,</i> such as were worn on festivals. This shewed that the people should exchange adversity for joy.'

        - "ZEC:3:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Mitre,</i> (cydarim) the pontiff's tiara, of byssus, Exodus xxviii. 4."
      v:007:
        - 'ZEC:3:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Judge.</i> The high priests were at the head till the Machabees. (Josephus, Antiquities xi. 4., and xx. 8.) --- Yet the nation was, (Calmet) till Simon, (Haydock) always dependent; and the judges were under foreign kings or governors. (Calmet) --- <i>Give thee,</i> &c. Angels to attend and assist thee. (Challoner) --- They are promised to help the pastors of the Church. (Worthington) --- They shall give information, ver. 9., and Exodus xxiii. 20. (Calmet) --- <i>Of them.</i> Septuagint, "who shall converse in the midst of these who stand:" (Haydock) thy children shall succeed in the pontificate. (Theod.[Theodotion <i>or</i> Theodoret])'
      v:008:
        - "ZEC:3:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Portending men.</i> That is, men who by words and actions are to foreshew wonders that are to come; (Challoner) or rather they require prodigies before they will take courage to build the temple; or they understand how to explain such things. (Calmet) --- <b>Orient</b>; Christ, who according to his humanity is the servant of God, is called the Orient, from his rising like the sun in the east to enlighten the world. (Challoner) --- St. Luke explains this of Christ, (Worthington) recording the words of Zacharias. [Luke i. 78.] (Haydock) --- Christ's birth was most pure. He gave light to the world. Some would explain this of Zorobabel; but as he was already present, it would seem more applicable to Nehemias. Yet both were only figures of Christ, and could not efface the iniquity of Juda, &c. The Messias is styled the Bud, chap. vi. 12., and Isaias iv. 2., &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Tsemach</i> signifies either \"the bud or the orient.\" (Haydock)"
      v:009:
        - "ZEC:3:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>The stone.</i> Another emblem of Christ, the rock, foundation, and corner-stone of his Church. --- <i>Eyes.</i> The manifold providence of Christ over his Church, or the seven gifts of the Spirit of God. (Challoner) --- The Jews were lately returned from a country where seven chief officers were styled \"the king's eyes,\" having to inform him of the conduct of governors, &c. Zorobabel shall build the temple, as a figure of Christ establishing his Church, chap. iv. 10. --- <i>Grave.</i> Septuagint, \"dig a pit.\" The rest agree with us. Christ adorns and instructs his Church. (Calmet) --- <i>Day.</i> The day of the passion of Christ, the source of all our good: when this precious stone shall be graved, that is cut and pierced with whips, thorns, nails, and spear. (Challoner)"
      v:010:

(Worthington) --- The angel explains the latter of Jesus and Zorobabel, ver. 14. The lights are the same with the angels, (ver. 10) and eyes, (chap. iii. 9.) subservient to these great men. Perhaps no candlestick of this description ever existed, though it alludes to that of Moses in some respects, Exodus xxxvii.

They were usually written only on one side. (Calmet) --- Septuagint have read <i>e</i> at the end of <i>megilla,</i> and render "a scythe," (Haydock) indicating chastisement. Aquila and Theodoret have <i>Diphthera,</i> and Symmachus <i>Kephalis.</i> (St. Jerome) --- The latter denotes the roller (Haydock) to which the parchment was sewed. (Menochius) --- The former signifies a book written on vellum, particularly that in which the poets say Jupiter marks the sins and punishments of mankind. The prophet saw a volume of this nature. (Calmet) --- The sins of the people, and the punishment designed for them, were described. It appeared <i>flying,</i> to shew that the decree came from heaven. (St. Chrysostom, Il. xxvii. ad pop.)

(Haydock) --- But is seems rather to denote the Chaldeans, whose sentence had been long pronounced, and who were punished by the Persians, and by the Greeks, as by two women.

The sequel seems to shew that the Jews, &c., occupied the towns of the Philistines under the Machabees. (Chaldean) (Grotius) (Calmet) --- The <i>divider</i> may denote any conqueror. (Menochius)'

Not knowing how to reconcile them, they feign one Messias glorious and another poor and despised; while others admit only of one, and reject either the abject or the exalted things which the prophets have spoken of him. The Church alone can reconcile these apparent contradictions in our Saviour's character. After predicting what would befall the Jews till about one hundred years before the birth of Christ, the prophet turns to Him who was the desire and comfort of the nation.

Hebrew at present reads, "and as for thee, <i>Sion,</i> by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners," &c., delivering the Hebrews out of Egypt by the paschal lamb.

(Challoner) --- It enables the weak to despise all things for the sake of virtue, and makes them fruitful and eloquent, as the original implies. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "a fragrant wine for virgins." (Haydock) --- Christ is the grain of wheat, which dying, brings forth much fruit, (John xii.) and "of this wheat that bread is made which came from heaven," John vi. (St. Jerome) (Worthington) --- "How shall not they have joy, who being inebriated with the cup of <i>our</i> Saviour, are made virgins?" This was partly verified in the days of the Machabees, to whom plenty was granted. (St. Jerome) (Haydock) --- Those who partake worthily of the blessed Eucharist, become strong and pure.

(Calmet) --- Yet \"St. John did not much regard what the Greek contained, but interpreted word for word as he had read in Hebrew,\" as the other sacred writers did when there was any material difference. St. Jerome, quoted by Kennicott. (Dis. ii. p. 347, &c.) (Haydock) --- Adopting this reading, we may explain this of Judas, whom the people greatly bewailed, 1 Machabees ix. 20. He was a figure of Christ, whom the prophet had chiefly in view. All the Jews who embraced the faith verify this prediction, (Calmet) as those particularly did who had been instrumental to the death of our Saviour, and afterwards entered into themselves, Acts ii. 37. Both Jews and Gentiles have all contributed by their sins to crucifying their Lord; and, at the last day, all shall look <i>on him</i> as their judge or as their deliverer. --- <i>Pierced.</i> Hebrew <i>dakaru.</i> (Haydock) --- Septuagint have transposed <i>d</i> and <i>r,</i> which are very similar, and read <i>rokdu,</i> \"have danced,\" or derided. (St. Jerome) --- The original implies, have outraged or blasphemed, as well as pierced. They shall henceforward cease to despise God and his law. (Calmet)"

Hebrew, \"they shall inscribe on the stables, Holy,\" &c. The most filthy places shall be purified and changed into temples; or, \"what is upon the little bells for horses shall be sanctified;\" or, on these \"bells shall be inscribed, sacred to the Lord.\" (Calmet) --- <i>Metsilloth</i> may signify a bell or bridle, &c. (Haydock) --- The bits were often of gold. (Virgil, Æneid vii., and viii.) (Calmet) --- St. Jerome's master said the word should be <i>motsiluth,</i> \"trappings\" and armour. (Haydock)"

(Challoner) (John ii. 16.) --- All former distinction of Jew and Gentile shall cease in the Church. Past faults shall be forgotten. (Calmet)'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - '<b>Zacharias</b> began to prophesy in the same year as Aggeus, and upon the same occasion. His prophecy is full of mysterious figures and promises of blessings, partly relating to the synagogue and partly to the Church of Christ. (Challoner) --- He is the "most obscure and longest of the twelve [minor prophets];" (St. Jerome) though Osee wrote the same number of chapters. (Haydock) --- Zacharias has been confounded with many others of the same name. Little is known concerning his life. Some have asserted that the ninth and two following chapters were written by <i>Jeremias,</i> in whose name chap. xi. 12., is quoted [in] Matthew xxvii. 9. But that is more probably a mistake of transcribers. Zacharias speaks more plainly of the Messias and of the last siege of Jerusalem than the rest, as he live nearer those times. (Calmet) --- His name signifies, "the memory of the Lord." (St. Jerome) --- He appeared only two months after Aggeus, and shewed that the Church should flourish in the synagogue, and much more after the coming of Christ, who would select his first preachers from among the Jews. Yet few of them shall embrace the gospel, in comparison with the Gentiles, though they shall at last be converted. (St. Jerome ad Paulin.) (Worthington)'
