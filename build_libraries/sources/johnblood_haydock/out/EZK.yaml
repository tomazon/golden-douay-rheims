    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "EZK:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>And</i> is either superfluous, as at the beginning of most of the sacred books, (Calmet) or shews the connection of what is written with what the prophet saw or heard internally. (St. Augustine, in Psalm iv.; St. Gregory) (Worthington) --- <i>Year:</i> either of the age of Ezechiel, or (as others will have it) from the solemn covenant made in the eighteenth year of Josias; (4 Kings xxiii.; Challoner; Worthington; Calmet) or he alludes to the era of Nabopolassur, used at Babylon, (Menochius) or to the last jubilee. See Sanctius. The thirtieth year, from the prediction of Holda to Josias, (Haydock) concurs with the fifth of the prophet's captivity, chap. xvii. 12. (Usher, the year of the world 3410.) --- <i>Fourth</i> of the sacred year, (Calmet) on Friday, 24th July, (Usher) or in January. (St. Jerome) --- <i>Chobar,</i> or Aboras, which runs westward into the Euphrates, above Thapsacus. (Strabo) --- The captives were in those parts, though not present. (Calmet) --- <i>Opened,</i> in spirit, (Haydock) by faith. (St. Jerome) --- The prophet fell prostrate, chap. ii. 1. (Haydock)"
      v:002:
        - 'EZK:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Captivity.</i> Literally, "transmigration," (Haydock) which is more agreeable to the Hebrew, &c. Jechonias delivered himself up. Six years after this, Sedecias was taken. (St. Jerome)'
      v:003:
        - 'EZK:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Hand;</i> power, energy of the Holy Spirit. (Theodoret)'
      v:004:
        - 'EZK:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>North,</i> denoting the invasion of Judea by the Chaldeans, Isaias xiv. 31. (Sanctius) --- The Jews thought the following vision inexplicable, and deliberated about rejecting the book, when Ananias offered to answer every difficulty. They assigned him three hundred barrels of oil to light his lamp, while he performed the task. (Rabbins) --- This hyperbole shews their idea of its obscurity. (Calmet) --- <i>Amber,</i> (<i>electri</i>) a compound of four parts of gold and one of silver, (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxiii. 4.) more precious than either. (St. Jerome) --- It may also mean <i>orichalchum,</i> or a mixture of gold and brass, (Bochart, anim. 2 b. vi. 16.) which was also preferred before gold alone, as it had the hardness of brass. (Lucret. Serv. in xii. Æneid.){JOIN}{BQ:2}-----<i>alboque orichalcho</i>{JOIN}{BQ:2}<i>Circumdat loricam humeris.</i>{JOIN}--- Two vessels are mentioned, probably of this composition, 1 Esdras viii. 27. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'EZK:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Living creatures.</i> Cherubims, (as appears from Ecclesiasticus xlix. 10.) represented to the prophet under these mysterious shapes, as supporting the throne of God, and as it were drawing his chariot. All this chapter appeared so obscure and full of mysteries to the ancient Hebrews, that, as we learn from St. Jerome, (ep. ad Paulin.) they suffered none to read it before they were thirty years old. (Challoner) --- The pagans had many such compound figures as are here represented. (Parkhurst, p. 411.) (Haydock) --- Sanchoniathon (apud Eusebius, præp. 2.) seems to have borrowed his description from this place. --- <i>In them.</i> They stood upright, and had some parts of the human figure. (Calmet) --- Indeed, it seems to have been predominant. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - "EZK:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Faces.</i> This sometimes means shapes; and Pererius supposes that the animal had the head of a man, and the breast covered with lions' hair, the feet or round cloven hoofs of an ox, and the wings of an eagle. But it had rather four faces as well as wings, the faces of the man and lion being to the right, and the other two to the left; (Calmet; Tirinus) or the eagle was behind (Haydock) or above the head of the man, and the lion and ox at his right and left. (Cornelius a Lapide) (Menochius)"
      v:007:
        - 'EZK:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Straight.</i> Hebrew, "a straight foot." Protestants prefer "feet." (Haydock) --- <i>Of a calf.</i> Aquila reads to the same import <i>hagol,</i> "round," instead of <i>hegel,</i> (Haydock) "a calf." Symmachus has "winged feet," like Mercury. (Calmet) --- Septuagint omit this, says St. Jerome, though we have his version of Symmachus as if it belonged to the Septuagint; and it occurs in Grabe as genuine. --- <i>Brass.</i> Septuagint add, "and their feathers were very light." (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'EZK:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Wings.</i> Their arms were covered with feathers, and the hand appeared at the extremity; or they had four arms under the wings, chap. x. 8. They all came from the shoulders, so as to correspond with the four faced animal, ver. 6. (Calmet) --- Others believe that each face had four wings, so that the animal would have sixteen. (Maldonat) --- In Isaias ix. 2., the cherub has six wings. The form was variable, as there was nothing in nature similar. They were perhaps designed to represent the eternity and dominion of God over the whole creation, ver. 28. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'EZK:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Another.</i> Two above were extended so as to support the throne, which seemed to rest on these eight wings connected together. The others were joined so as perfectly to cover what was below the breast. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "And the wings of those four <i>were</i> touching each other, and their faces (Calmet reads with Chaldean and Hebrew, <i>wings</i>) turned not," &c. (Haydock) --- The wings did not imitate those of birds, going to and fro, but were constantly in the same direction; or the animals did not change their respective situations: as they had four faces, there was always one of them turned to the opposite quarters of the world. (Calmet) --- They turned not about, (ver. 12.) but having faces on every side, were ready to go any way. (Worthington)'
      v:010:
        - 'EZK:1:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Over.</i> This is not specified in Hebrew, Chaldean, Septuagint, or St. Jerome. (Calmet) --- "The face of an eagle for all the four." It must have been <i>above</i> or behind the man, as the situation of the other two faces is here determined, ver. 6. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'EZK:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Faces.</i> Septuagint, "wings:" and indeed it does not appear how their <i>faces</i> were <i>stretched upwards,</i> (Calmet) unless they looked earnestly that way; though, out of respect, they covered their faces with two wings.'
      v:014:
        - 'EZK:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Flashes.</i> Hebrew <i>Bazak.</i> (Haydock) --- Theodotion retains the original. His version seems to have been inserted in the Septuagint, (Calmet) who omitted this verse, as seeming to contradict ver. 9., and 12. (St. Jerome) --- Yet it only signifies that the motion was quick as lightning, though they did not alter their situation with respect to each other.'
      v:015:
        - 'EZK:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Faces.</i> One wheel crossed another at right angles, so that it was ready to move in any direction, (ver. 17.; Calmet) like a globe. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - 'EZK:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Sea;</i> sky blue. Hebrew, "Tharsis," which Symmachus renders "the hyacinth;" a precious stone, Exodus xxviii. 20. (Calmet) --- <i>Midst.</i> The evangelists and New Testament agree perfectly with the Old. (St. Gregory, hom. vi.) (Worthington)'
      v:017:
        - 'EZK:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Parts. When they went, they went by their four parts.</i> That is, indifferently to any of their sides, either forward or backward, to the right or to the left. (Challoner) --- Their motion was connected with the chariot, ver. 20. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - 'EZK:1:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Eyes,</i> like Argus, or the tail of a peacock. (Calmet) --- The eye is sometimes put for a colour. (Grotius)'
      v:020:
        - "EZK:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Life.</i> They were moved like the rest by the whirlwind, or by living creatures. They seemed to be animated, as Homer describes Vulcan's tripods."
      v:022:
        - 'EZK:1:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Crystal,</i> or sapphire, ver. 26., and chap. x. 1. This shining sky was like the footstool of the Lord, and rested on eight wings, ver. 9, 23.'
      v:024:
        - 'EZK:1:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Voice.</i> The motion of the wings made a noise like a torrent, or thunder. --- <i>God.</i> Hebrew, "self-sufficient," as Septuagint, &c., render it, {GREEK:START ikanou}ικανου{GREEK:END}. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "like the voice of the Almighty." (Haydock) --- <i>Down;</i> or rather ceased to make such a noise, ver. 25. (Calmet)'
      v:026:
        - 'EZK:1:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Upon it.</i> This might be omitted, as the Vulgate has only <i>desuper, above.</i> (Haydock) --- God was pleased to assume the shape of man, seated on the throne.'
      v:027:
        - 'EZK:1:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Amber,</i> or orichalcum, ver. 4.'
      v:028:
        - 'EZK:1:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Rainbow,</i> encircling the sky blue throne and the flame. Nothing could be more dazzling, nor better manifest the subjection of man. (Calmet) --- The prophet saw four visions at once; the whirlwind, (ver. 4.) the living creatures, (ver. 5.) the wheels, (ver. 15.) and the man seated on a throne, in the sky, ver. 26. To explain all these mysteries, a large commentary would scarcely suffice. (Worthington) --- The tempest, cloud, and fire, shew the impending ruin of the Jews. The ministers of God are ever ready to execute his orders. The wisdom of Providence is denoted by the name of the cherubim, the connection of causes by the four wheels, &c. (Menochius) --- God appears in his chariot going to war. He denounces vengeance on the guilty, chap. ii., and xliii. See Cornelius a Lapide. (Haydock)'

      v:012: 'EZK:1:12 | 12 | 12 | And every one of them went straight forward: whither the impulse of the spirit was to go, thither they went: and they turned not when they went.'
      v:013: 'EZK:1:13 | 13 | 13 | And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like that of burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps. This was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the living creatures, a bright fire, and lightning going forth from the fire.'
      v:014: 'EZK:1:14 | 14 | 14 | And the living creatures ran, and returned like flashes of lightning.'
      v:015: 'EZK:1:15 | 15 | 15 | Now, as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared upon the earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces.'
      v:016: 'EZK:1:16 | 16 | 16 | And the appearance of the wheels, and the work of them, was like the appearance of the sea: and the four had all one likeness: and their appearance and their work <i>was</i> as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel.'

      v:024: 'EZK:1:24 | 24 | 24 | And I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as it were the voice of the most high God: when they walked, it was like the voice of a multitude, like the noise of an army, and when they stood, their wings were let down.'

        - 'EZK:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Face,</i> to adore God. (Menochius) --- <i>Son of man.</i> Our Saviour, out of humility, takes this title, which no other gave him; as the angel does commonly to this prophet, who was his figure: few else have received it, (Daniel viii. 17.) but the reason is not known. (Worthington) --- God here teaches Ezechiel not to boast of the honour shewn to him, since he must always remember that he is but a feeble mortal. (Calmet)'

        - 'EZK:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Forbear</i> to sin. (Haydock) --- He thus insinuates free-will. (St. Jerome) --- If they refuse to hear my <i>prophet,</i> they will at least perceive that they are inexcusable. (Calmet)'

(Haydock) --- <i>Woe,</i> or the words of the penitent, of the blessed, and of the damned. (Worthington) --- The <i>canticles</i> were of a mournful nature, and the prophet had sorrows to announce.

      v:001:
        - 'EZK:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Eat this book, and go speak to the children of Israel.</i> By this eating of the book, was signified the diligent attention and affection with which we are to receive and embrace the word of God; and to let it as it were, sink into our interior by devout meditation.

(St. Jerome) --- But the time was not yet come. (Calmet) --- From this text and Matthew xi. 21., it appears that \"the same grace\" is accepted by some and rejected by others, as \"more grace is added to the former, which was sufficient before, and by this....is made effectual\" through God's mercy, Romans ix. (Worthington) --- Those who reject the first grace, can blame only themselves, if they receive no more. The same grace falling on a heat better prepared by God, like seed on good soil, is more fruitful."
      v:007:
        - "EZK:3:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Hard.</i> Literally, \"rubbed\" like a stone, or brass; <i>attrita.</i> (Haydock) --- God's ambassadors (Ephesians vi. 20.; Calmet) must do their utmost. (Haydock) --- The success must not puff them up, nor the failure too much depressed them, as all regards God, (Matthew x. 40.) who will know how to make things conduce to his own glory. They must only bewail the blindness of sinners. (Calmet) --- The care of them, and not the cure, will be required at their hands, ver. 19. (Haydock)"

        - "EZK:4:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Three,</i> &c. St. Jerome says some \"Vulgate,\" (Haydock) Latin, (Calmet) or rather incorrect Greek (Haydock) copies read 100, others 150. See Origen, &c. (Calmet) --- The Alexandrian copy has the former, (Haydock) the Roman edition the latter number; and is followed by Theodoret and Maldonat. (Calmet) --- But the more accurate Septuagint agree with the Hebrew, &c. The captivity of Israel must be dated from Phacee, (4 Kings xv. 29.) to the end of the reign of Darius Memnon, who espoused Esther, and granted liberty \"to all the Jews;\" or rather from Manathem, (4 Kings xv. 19.) to the 28th of the same king Assuerus. Thus God's \"grace, we think, and we may so speak without arrogance, has enabled us to explain this difficulty, which no other has done.\" (St. Jerome) --- Many confound the duration of the iniquity of Israel with that of Juda, forming 430 years; and they explain it of the time during which the nation had prevaricated. But this seems unnatural. We may rather conclude, that the prophet speaks of a separate judgment, and dates from the destruction of Samaria and of Jerusalem. The former city was taken the year of the world 3283. If we add 390 years, we shall find the year 3673 the very year when Alexander [the Great] overcame Darius, and soon after granted the Jews full liberty to return, or live according to their own laws. This he granted to those <i>in Babylon,</i> and to the Israelites (Calmet) <i>in Media.</i> Josephus, Antiquities xi. ultra & contra Apion i. --- Philadelphus afterwards liberated many in Egypt, (Josephus, Antiquities xii. 2.) as Osee (xi. 11.) had foretold. The chastisement of Juda must be dated from the destruction of Jerusalem under Sedecias, till Darius, the Mede, favoured the Jews about forty years afterwards. (Calmet) --- St. Jerome only allows forty years to have elapsed from the first of Jechonias till the first of Cyrus. The want of an exact chronology gives rise to many such difficulties. (Haydock) --- It is very hard to explain how the ten tribes were 390 and the two tribes 40 years in captivity, as it is certain that the latter were seventy year banished from their own country. (Worthington) --- Perhaps during the last thirty their condition was greatly ameliorated, after the decree of Cyrus, though the liberation was only perfect under Hystaspes and Esther. (Haydock) --- The <i>iniquity</i> of Israel, from Solomon to Salmanasar, lasted 390 years; and that of Juda, under the reign of Manasses, was most abominable for the space of forty years; (Tournemine) or it continued so long from the 18th of Josias till the 4th, after the city was destroyed, and the land became a desert. (Usher, the year of the world 3380 to 3420.) --- But how shall the reign of the virtuous Josias be included in this period? (Haydock) --- The action of the prophet lying 430 days, denoted the length of the siege of Jerusalem, during which extreme scarcity should be felt, and also the captivity of the people. Some have thought that he could not remain 390 days on one side, and that all passed in spirit. But what impression would that make upon the people? He was chained down, (Calmet) to represent their miserable condition. (Haydock) --- Prædo saw a fool who lay tied in one posture for above fifteen years.

Yet even of this third or fourth part, many engage in civil broils, and perish. St. Jerome hints that the Septuagint is interpolated from Theodotion, ver. 12, and that their version only comprised the pentateuch. But the other books went at least under the same title; and there must be some mistake in the words asterisked, since they occur in the Hebrew, Vulgate, &c., <i>third</i> being only substituted for <i>fourth:</i> \"And a fourth part of thee shall fall by the sword.\" The Hebrew is rather less degrading to the Jews, as there would be thus at most one-third preserved, instead of a part only of one-fourth.

His chariot then rests on the mountain to the east of the city. Thus his reasons for punishing the people become evident."

In Hebrew the name is <i>Tammuz,</i> (Challoner) which means "concealed," as Adonis signifies "my lord." This idol, which the Egyptians called Osiris, was placed in a coffin, and bewailed till it was pretended he was come to life, when rejoicings took place. Obscene pictures were carried about; and the more honest pagans were ashamed of these practices, which began in Egypt, and became almost general. Moses alludes to them, Leviticus xix. 27., and Deuteronomy xiv. 1.

But St. Jerome, and other interpreters, conclude it was the form of the letter <i>thau,</i> which, in the ancient Hebrew character, was the form of a cross. (Challoner) --- Of this many inscriptions still extant bear witness. (Montfaucon.) --- Some Rabbins allow that the last letter was used but in honour of "the law," <i>Thorah.</i> The cross is supposed to be the hieroglyphic of a future life, (Hist. Rufini. ii. 29.) and found frequently in the pictures or (Haydock) in the tables of Isis. But it rather represents a key. Soldiers who were acquitted received the letter <u><i>T</i></u>, and those who were sentenced to die had {GREEK:START Th}Θ{GREEK:END}, (Calmet) alluding to {GREEK:START Thanatos}Θανατοσ{GREEK:END}, "death." (Haydock) --- We may, however, suppose that if God designated any letter, it would be some letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and accordingly the last had formerly the figure of †. {GREEK:START x}ξ{GREEK:END}. though this text may signify "a sign" in general. The virtuous would be discriminated from the guilty, as if they were marked. (Calmet) --- The door-posts of the Hebrews were stained with blood, in Egypt, to shew that all should be redeemed by that of Christ; and here those who shall be saved, received the mark of his cross. This sign has always been held in veneration among Christians, (Worthington) and used in conferring baptism, consecrating the blessed Eucharist, &c. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lv. in Matthew, and lxxxiv. in John) (St. Augustine, tr. cxviii. in John, and ser. ci. de temp., &c.) --- It appeared to Constantine with this inscription, "In this conquer;" (Eusebius, vit. i. 22.) and again over Jerusalem; (St. Cyril, ep. ad Constantium.) and will be borne before Christ, at his last coming, (Matthew xxiv.) to the joy of those who have performed their baptismal promises, and to the confusion (Worthington) of the <i>enemies of the cross of Christ.</i> (Haydock)'

      v:009: 'EZK:13:9 | 9 | 9 | And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vain things, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel: and you shall know that I am the Lord God.'
      v:010: 'EZK:13:10 | 10 | 10 | Because they have deceived my people, saying: Peace, and there is no peace: and the people built up a wall, and they daubed it with dirt without straw.'
      v:011: 'EZK:13:11 | 11 | 11 | Say to them that daub without tempering, that it shall fall: for there shall be an overflowing shower, and I will cause great hailstones to fall violently from above, and a stormy wind to throw it down.'
      v:012: 'EZK:13:12 | 12 | 12 | Behold, when the wall is fallen: shall it not be said to you: Where is the daubing wherewith you have daubed it?'

      v:019: 'EZK:13:19 | 19 | 19 | And they violated me among my people, for a handful of barley, and a piece of bread, to kill souls which should not die, and to save souls alive which should not live, telling lies to my people that believe lies.'

      v:022: 'EZK:13:22 | 22 | 22 | Because with lies you have made the heart of the just to mourn, whom I have not made sorrowful; and have strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his evil way, and live.'

(Challoner) --- They came, it seems, to tempt the prophet, (Calmet) as God shewed him. Thus worldlings consult Catholic priests; yet are resolved to join with heretics. (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - 'EZK:14:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>According.</i> Hebrew, "in (Calmet) the multitude of his idols." (Haydock) --- I will still disclose the truth; (Chaldean) or a false prophet is here spoken of, whom God will suffer to deceive those who wish to be deluded. He will not have his own prophets speak an untruth. See 3 Kings xxii. 10. Christ evaded the insidious questions of his enemies, Matthew xxi. 23. (Calmet)'

      v:009:
        - 'EZK:14:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Err.</i> He speaks of false prophets, answering out of their own heads, and according to their own corrupt inclinations. --- <i>Deceived,</i> &c. God Almighty <i>deceives</i> false prophets, partly by withdrawing his light from them; and abandoning them to their own corrupt inclinations, which push them on to prophesy such things as are agreeable to those that consult them: and partly by disappointing them, and causing all things to happen contrary to what they have said. (Challoner) --- God permits the deception, to punish both the impostor and his hearers. (Worthington) --- Thus was Balaam treated, (Calmet) Numbers xxii. (Haydock) --- He could do nothing of himself, (St. Jerome) 2 Kings xxii. 22. (Calmet) --- Here also an interrogation might be used (Haydock) in Hebrew, "have I?" &c. (Feiffer dub. cent. 4. b. lviii.) --- I have manifested the deceit, chap. xiii. 18.'

(Worthington) --- When God is resolved to treat all with rigour, he will save only the just. They shall not be able to protect even their children. But Jerusalem shall not experience such severity, ver. 21. (Calmet) --- Noe could not avert the deluge, nor Job the death of his children, neither could Daniel rescue his people from captivity. (St. Jerome) --- The first denotes pastors, the second fathers of families, and Daniel such as live continent. (St. Augustine) --- All three had been very merciful. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xliii. 1. in Genesis) --- Job is placed for holy laymen, and Daniel for people of religious orders. (St. Gregory, Mor. i. 13.) (Worthington) --- Hence perhaps Job is placed last, though cotemporary with Moses, as most people suppose. He is not therefore a fabulous personage. (Haydock)'

      v:022:

(Worthington) --- <i>Doings.</i> Their words (Calmet) and conduct even in captivity, will evince that they have not been punished unjustly. (St. Jerome) --- From them you may judge what sort of men their fathers were; or, as they have been spared for their virtue, you may conclude that the rest would not have perished, if they had been innocent.

(Calmet) --- The wild vine (Sanctius) grows very large, and the wood is durable, so that statues, pillars, and ladders were formed of it. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xiv. 1.) --- Strabo (ii., and xi.) mentions the trunk of a vine which two men could hardly clasp, and the bunch of grapes was two cubits high. But the prophet speaks of the small branches, which are fit only for the fire. (Calmet) --- God's Church is often compared to a vine on account of its fruit, and the branches separated form her resemble the useless cuttings. (St. Augustine, tr. lxxxi. in John) (Worthington) --- See Ward's <i>Tree of Life,</i> where this is set in a very striking light.

Salt was also used to dry up the humidity and stop the pores, (St. Jerome) or it was mixed with water to harden the skin and navel. (Avicen. Gall.

        - "EZK:18:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Edge.</i> Those in captivity would not allow that they were punished for their own sins: God convinces them of the contrary. (Worthington) --- They knew that he often visited the sins of the fathers upon the children, (Exodus xx. 5., and xxiv. 5.; Calmet) when they also <i>hated</i> him, (Haydock) and that many had suffered for their parents' faults, like those of Saul, David, &c. (Calmet) --- But these were all guilty of original sin at least, and death is not always a real misfortune. (Haydock) --- God seems to allow that the complaints had hitherto had some grounds, (Jeremias xxxi.) but that they should be removed after the captivity, and still more effectually by the death of Christ, who came to redeem sinners, and rejected none. By baptism he cancels original sin, the <i>sour grape,</i> and those who cannot receive it are not innocent. (Calmet) --- God chastises the body, but not the soul of children, for their parents' faults: (Menochius) and this conduct is a trial for them, which may increase their glory. (Haydock)"

Some irregularly worshipped God in these high places, under many pious kings; and were tolerated, (Calmet) though condemned for so doing. (Haydock) --- <i>Woman.</i> The pagans abstained by the light of reason. (Calmet) --- The contrary practice, "it is said," would give rise to lepers or monsters, (St. Jerome) as experience evinces. (Calmet) --- It was forbidden in the Christian Church. (St. Augustine, q. 64. in Leviticus xx. 18.; St. Gregory, resp. 10. ad Aug.) (Calmet) --- But no such questions are now asked.

        - "EZK:18:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Will.</i> God sincerely wishes that the sinner should be converted. If he refuse grace, it is only in punishment of former transgressions. (St. Augustine, ep. 217.) --- He wills antecedently their salvation, (1 Timothy ii. 4.) though he has a consequent will to punish them, as they speak in the schools, because they themselves will not be saved. (Sanctius) (Calmet) --- God's absolute will is always fulfilled, not that which is conditional. (St. John Damascene, Fide ii. 29.; St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae p. 1. q. 19. a. 6.) --- He does enough by offering his graces and the death of Christ, to shew that his will is sincere; though by a consequent will his justice punishes the impenitent. Thus a virtuous judge would have all to observe the laws and live: but finding some transgress, so as to become pernicious, he punishes them with death. (Worthington)"

        - 'EZK:20:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Month:</i> the year of the world 3411, August 27. (Usher) --- Ezechiel had prophesied in the fourth year; then was silent a year and two months, or 430 days. He opened his mouth again in the sixth year, (chap. viii. 1.) and now in the seventh year he is ordered not to answer. (Worthington) --- We know not what the <i>ancients</i> wanted to know; but their design was evil. (Calmet)'

        - 'EZK:20:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Judgest them;</i> or, if thou wilt enter into the cause, and plead against them. (Challoner) --- Lay before them the iniquities of their fathers, and their own, which bring on the reprobation of the greatest part. God will form his Church out of a few of them and of the Gentiles. The return of a small number from captivity is also insinuated.'
      v:006:
        - 'EZK:20:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Excelleth.</i> Hebrew, "is beauty <i>or</i> a desire." Septuagint, "a honeycomb." (Calmet)'

(Challoner) --- Moses found them in this condition in Egypt, and he could not entirely reclaim them. (Calmet) --- Many still secreted their idols, chap. xxiii. 1., and Acts vii. 42. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'EZK:20:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Egypt.</i> Their disorders called for such severity. But God was restrained by the dangers (Calmet) of blasphemy, &c., to which the faithful and idolaters would thus have been exposed. (Haydock) --- He saved them as he had promised, though they did not deserve it. (Worthington)'
      v:010:
        - 'EZK:20:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Brought.</i> Literally, "cast," (Haydock) as if they had been reluctant.'
      v:011:

        - 'EZK:20:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Sabbaths.</i> We only read of one man gathering sticks, and the people manna once on those days, Exodus xv., and xvi. But Moses does not mention all. (Calmet) --- Sabbath often denotes the whole law, which they transgressed; and as long as they retained an affection for idols, they could not observe the sabbaths so as to please God.'
      v:014:
        - 'EZK:20:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>But.</i> Literally, "And I did for," &c. This motive caused me to spare them.

      v:023:
        - 'EZK:20:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Again,</i> or also. (Haydock) --- Four times are specified [in] ver. 13, 15, 21., which may allude to the adoration of the calf, the graves of concupiscence, the murmuring, and commerce with the women and idols of Moab, Exodus xxiii., and Numbers x., and xiv., and xxv. (Calmet)'
      v:025:
        - 'EZK:20:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Not good.</i> The laws and ordinances of their enemies: or those imposed upon them by that cruel tyrant the devil, to whose power they were delivered up for their sins; (Challoner) which may be styled <i>the statutes of your fathers,</i> &c., ver. 18. (Haydock) --- God is often said to do what he only permits. (Calmet) --- He abandoned them to their own perversity. (St. Jerome) (Deuteronomy xxxii. 21, 37.) --- If God had spoken of the Decalogue, &c., would he say such laws were <i>not good,</i> after he had testified that the observers <i>shall live in them?</i> ver. 11. He established the ceremonial law, at the same time. See Kimchi; Menochius, &c. Chaldean, "I have given them up to their foolish desires. They have established bad statutes and laws which will not give them life." This seems the best explanation. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "Have I given....(<b>26</b>) and have I polluted them?" &c. (Manasse Ben. Israel.) The precepts had also a bad effect, and were given in condescension to the weakness of the people, (Origen) particularly the ceremonial part. (St. Just.[St. Justin Martyr?]; St. Chrysostom; St. Jerome, &c.) --- They did not justify, (St. Augustine) and were <i>not good,</i> compared with those of the new law. (St. Gregory, mor. xxviii. 9.) --- Thus Solon gave the Athenians "the best laws that they would receive," (Plutarch) though others more perfect might have been devised. (Calmet)'
      v:026:
        - 'EZK:20:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>I polluted them,</i> &c. That is, I gave them up to such blindness, in punishment of their offences, as to pollute themselves with the blood of all their first-born, whom they offered up to their idols in compliance with their wicked devices. (Challoner) (Menochius) (Leviticus xviii. 21., and 4 Kings iii. ultra[last verse], and xxi. 6. (Calmet) --- <i>Offered.</i> Protestants, "caused to pass through <i>the fire</i> all,["] &c., chap. xvi. 21. --- <i>For their.</i> Protestants, "that I might make them desolate to the end, that," &c.'
      v:029:
        - 'EZK:20:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Called high.</i> Hebrew, "Bamah," (Haydock) out of contempt. (Calmet) --- The Jews were so much attached to the high places, that they called the altar of the Lord by the same name. Thus heretics are convicted by the very names they use, calling sacrifice <i>service,</i> &c. (Worthington)'
      v:032:
        - 'EZK:20:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Stones.</i> This was the secret intention of the <i>ancients,</i> (ver. 1.; Haydock) and of many in captivity, who were only praise-worthy compared with those at Jerusalem, chap. xi. 15.'

        - 'EZK:20:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Covenant</i> of the gospel, by the powerful attractions of grace, Luke xiv. 24., John vi. 69., and vii. 46., and 2 Corinthians x. 4.'
      v:038:
        - 'EZK:20:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Israel.</i> They shall continue in exile; or the rebel Jews who will not believe in Christ, shall be cast off. (Calmet)'
      v:039:
        - "EZK:20:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Walk,</i> &c. It is not an allowance, much less a commandment to serve idols; but a figure of speech, by which God would have them to understand, that if they would walk after their idols, they must not pretend to serve him at the same time: for that he would by no means suffer such a mixture of worship. (Challoner) (St. Jerome) --- Continue, if you dare, to serve idols. I will still bring you back. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"take away each your devices; and then if you hear me, (Grabe's copy adds, <i>not</i>) and defile not my,\" &c. (Haydock) --- God would rather have idolaters leave him wholly, than halt between two, (3 Kings xviii.) neither hot nor cold; (Apocalypse iii.) for such dishonour God's name the most, Romans ii. 24. (Worthington)"
      v:040:
        - 'EZK:20:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Mountain.</i> The foregoing verse, to make the sense complete, must be understood so as to condemn and reject that mixture of worship which the Jews then followed. In this verse God promises to the true Israelites, especially to those of the Christian Church, that they should serve him in another manner in his holy mountain, the spiritual Sion, and shall be accepted of by him. (Challoner)'
      v:043:
        - EZK:20:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Committed.</i> This is a picture of the converts to Christianity. (Calmet)
      v:046:
        - 'EZK:20:46 | 46 | 46 | <i>Of the south.</i> Jerusalem lay towards the south of Babylon, where the prophet then was, and is here called <i>the forest of the south field,</i> and is threatened with utter desolation. (Challoner) See chap. xxi. (Calmet) --- In Jerusalem there were good and bad. (Worthington)'
      v:047:
        - 'EZK:20:47 | 47 | 47 | <i>Burned,</i> with war and famine, Jeremias xxi. 14. (Calmet) --- <i>North,</i> from Egypt to Mesopotamia. (Theodoret) --- Nabuchodonosor invaded those parts. (Haydock)'
      v:049:
        - "EZK:20:49 | 49 | 49 | <i>Parables.</i> They were easy enough to understand, but the Jews would not comprehend them no more than our Saviour's words, John x. 24. (Calmet) --- Much of this prophecy was so hard, that all seemed to be parables. (Worthington)"

        - 'EZK:28:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Prince.</i> The Jews say Hiram, (St. Jerome) supposing that he lived a thousand years; though this is not requisite, as he died only four hundred and thirty years before. The idea is childish. The king who was taken and slain at this siege, was probably (Calmet) Ithobalos. (Josephus, Antiquities x. 11.) --- Origen applies this to the angel guardian of Tyre. St. Augustine thins an allusion is made to the fall of Lucifer. But it may all refer to the king, (Calmet) though others explain part of him and the rest of the devil. (St. Jerome) (Estius)'
      v:003:
        - 'EZK:28:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Than Daniel;</i> viz., in thy own conceit.

        - "EZK:28:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Resemblance.</i> The king of Tyre, by his dignity and his natural perfections, bore in himself a certain resemblance to God, by reason of which he might be called <i>the seal of resemblance,</i> &c. But what is here said to him is commonly understood of Lucifer, the king over all the children of pride. (Challoner) --- A seal is perfect when it represents things exactly. The prophet speaks ironically, to repress the king's vanity."
      v:013:
        - 'EZK:28:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Paradise.</i> Thou hadst every thing delightful at Tyre. (Calmet) --- <i>Covering.</i> Hebrew, "bandage;" diadem, (Haydock) or belt. Septuagint specify twelve stones. See Exodus xxviii. 17. --- <i>Pipes;</i> music used at the coronation, which was celebrated as a birth-day. (Calmet) --- God gives and withdraws power from all kings. As long as they act well, they are in a sort of sanctuary. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - "EZK:28:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Stretched out.</i> That is, thy wings extended. This alludes to the figure of the cherubims in the sanctuary, which with <i>stretched out</i> wings covered the ark, (Challoner) on <i>the holy mountain.</i> (St. Jerome, &c.) --- <i>Fire.</i> That is, bright and precious stones, which sparkle like fire. (Challoner) --- With these the king's robes glittered, or he walked upon them, Esther i. 6. (Calmet) --- <i>Calcacabatur onyx.</i> (Lucan x.)"

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'EZK:29:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Eleventh.</i> Hebrew, "twelfth." Septuagint, "first of the twelfth month of the twelfth year." There are other variations in the versions. St. Jerome reads the first in Hebrew, as Theodoret does, who says that it and the Syriac have the twelfth year: which is true, if we neglect the points. (Calmet) --- The prophets do not observe the order of times. What is here delivered, was sooner fulfilled; or Tyre and Sodom lay nearer than Egypt. (Worthington) --- The three next chapters regard that country.'
      v:002:
        - 'EZK:29:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Pharao,</i> Ephree, Jeremias xliv 30. He came to assist Sedecias; but the Chaldeans raised the siege, went to meet him, an defeated his army. After they had subdued the neighbouring nations, Tyre, &c., they fell upon Egypt. (The year of the world 3433.) (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'EZK:29:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Dragon.</i> Hebrew <i>tannin,</i> (Haydock) whence <i>thunnus</i> may be derived, means any water monster, and seems here put for the <i>crocodile,</i> (Calmet) which Pharao signifies. (Grotius) --- It was the symbol of Egypt, (Calmet) and adored by the people, Jeremias xv. 2. --- <i>Rivers;</i> the different branches of the Nile, and the canals. --- <i>Myself.</i> I owe my power to no other. (Calmet) --- "Apries is said to think that no god could deprive him of the kingdom, so well he seemed to have established it." (Herodotus ii. 169.) --- So the ancient Pharao said; I know not the Lord, Exodus v. 2. He boasts of having conducted the waters of the Nile through the land, ver. 9. (Menochius) --- This river was honoured as the greatest of the gods. (Heliod. 9.) ---{JOIN}{BQ:2}Terra suis contenta bonis non indiga mercis{JOIN}{BQ:2}Aut Jovis; in solo tanta est fiducia Nilo. (Lucan viii.)'
      v:004:
        - "EZK:29:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Bridle.</i> The Tentyrians jump upon the crocodile's back, give it a club to bite at, which they seize with both hands, and bring it to the shore. (Pliny, [Natural History?] viii. 25.) --- Others throw a hook baited with swine's flesh, and holding the rope on the shore, make a little pig squeak, which draws the attention of the crocodile; and, as it comes for its prey, it swallows the hook, and its eyes being filled with dust is easily slain. (Herodotus ii. 70.) --- Apries sent an army against Cyrene, which being defeated as it was thought by the king's fault, many of the Egyptians revolted. He sent Amasis to reduce them, but they gave him the crown. (Herodotus ii. 161. and iv. 159.) --- Nabuchodonsor taking advantage of these disturbances, and perhaps invited by Amasis, entered Egypt, drove Apries into Higher Egypt, slew many of the inhabitants, and Jews, &c., and left Amasis to govern the wretched remains of that kingdom. (Usher, the year of the world 3430.) The Scripture, however, seems to say that Pharao was slain; (Jeremias xliii., &c.; Calmet) which Ctesias assures us was done by Amasis, though Herodotus (ii. 169.) says he was killed by the people, and buried with his fathers. This latter circumstance is not very probable: but the historian followed the account of the priests, who would mention what was most honourable for the nation. He seems to have been left unburied, ver. 5. <i>Scales.</i> The people depended on the king and shared his fate. (Calmet)"
      v:006:
        - 'EZK:29:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Israel,</i> tempting them to rebel. (St. Jerome) --- He promised more than he was able or strove to perform, though he made a show of giving aid.'

        - 'EZK:29:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Tower;</i> or rather (Calmet) Hebrew and Septuagint, "from Magdol to Syene." (Haydock) --- This was on the frontiers of <i>Ethiopia,</i> below the cataracts. (Pliny, [Natural History?] v. 9.)'
      v:011:
        - 'EZK:29:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Years,</i> till the third of Cyrus, who gave liberty to all the captives at the beginning of his reign, ver. 13. (Calmet) --- Amasis reigned forty-four years in Lower Egypt, (Herodotus iii. 10.) over the few whom Nabuchodonosor spared.'
      v:014:
        - 'EZK:29:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Low.</i> The Jews were not more tempted to apply to them for aid. (Calmet) --- Amasis strove to shake off the yoke: but Cambyses came and slew many. Psammenites killed himself; (Herodotus iii. 9.) or was taken to Susa, and the country laid waste. (Ctesias) --- Egypt has almost ever since been subject to foreign princes, (Haydock) Persians, Greeks, Romans, Saracens, Mamelukes, and Turks. The trade of Egypt, by caravans, was in a manner destroyed for forty years by Nabuchodonosor, whose victories Megesthenes and Berosus attest 300 years before Christ. (Watson)'
      v:017:
        - 'EZK:29:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Year:</i> fifteen (Calmet) or seventeen years after the preceding prophecy, (ver. 1.; Worthington) but on the same subject.'
      v:018:
        - 'EZK:29:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Peeled,</i> with carrying machines of war and burdens for thirteen years. --- <i>No reward</i> worth the labour. The new city surrendered upon terms, (Calmet) or the citizens shipped off their most valuable goods, and retired to Carthage, &c. God gives a temporal reward for moral virtues, (St. Jerome) even to infidels. (Worthington) --- Thus he rewarded the ancient Romans, and the midwives. (St. Augustine, City of God v. 12.; and St. Thomas Aquinas, [Summa Theologiae] i. 2. q. 114. a. 10.) --- They had no intention of pleasing God, (Calmet) or of directing their labours for his service. (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - 'EZK:29:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Horn:</i> Zorobabel; (St. Jerome) Jechonias, who was honoured by Evilmerodac; (Tirinus) or Daniel and Mardochai, with all the nation. --- <i>Month.</i> Thou shalt speak boldly, and they will give credit to thee henceforward. (Calmet)'

The author of the Book of Job takes great pains to remove this mistake. God sometimes sends crosses for a trial, (Calmet) and to increase the merit of his servants; though it be very true, (Haydock) "no one is miserable except he deserve it." (St. Augustine)'

      v:003: 'EZK:35:3 | 3 | 3 | Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against thee, Mount Seir, and I will stretch forth my hand upon thee, and I will make thee desolate and waste.'
      v:004: 'EZK:35:4 | 4 | 4 | I will destroy thy cities, and thou shalt be desolate; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.'
      v:005: 'EZK:35:5 | 5 | 5 | Because thou hast been an everlasting enemy, and hast shut up the children of Israel, in the hands of the sword in the time of their affliction, in the time of their last iniquity.'
      v:006: 'EZK:35:6 | 6 | 6 | Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God, I will deliver thee up to blood, and blood shall pursue thee: and whereas thou hast hated blood, blood shall pursue thee.'
      v:007: EZK:35:7 | 7 | 7 | And I will make Mount Seir waste and desolate; and I will take away from it him that goeth and him that returneth.

      v:001:
        - 'EZK:36:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Israel.</i> The restoration of the Jews and the redemption of Christ, constitute this fourth division. (Worthington) -- Edom has seized parts of the country, as if I had abandoned my people for ever.'
      v:002:
        - 'EZK:36:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Heights.</i> Septuagint, "deserts." The mountains are often styled eternal, as being the best symbols of durability, Deuteronomy xxxiii. 15.'
      v:003:
        - 'EZK:36:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Reproach.</i> This God had repeatedly threatened, Deuteronomy xxviii. 37., (Calmet) and Jeremias xxiv. 9. --- People talked of their distress. (Worthington)'
      v:008:
        - "EZK:36:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Israel.</i> Some apply what follows to the captives returning; others, perceiving that the expressions were not then literally verified, have recourse to the reign of 1000 years. Others again explain the whole of Christ's Church. But some expressions refer to it, and others to the captives; which, though mixed together, induce no confusion, as what belongs to the Jews was a figure of what regarded Christ; and the predictions of the Messias might be applied to the Jews in an hyperbolical sense. (St. Augustine, Doct. iii. 34.) (St. Jerome) (Menochius) (Tirinus) (Calmet)"
      v:011:
        - 'EZK:36:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Greater.</i> Septuagint, "similar." (Haydock) --- It would be difficult to shew that the Jews arrived at greater eminence after the captivity than before, (Calmet) though they were less addicted to idolatry. Their kingdom was not independent: they had no prophets, &c. But the superior numbers and excellence of the Christian Church is manifest.'
      v:012:
        - 'EZK:36:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Them.</i> Antiochus and the Romans laid waste the country; (Calmet) and Adrian would not allow the Jews to come near Jerusalem. (St. Jerome) (Eusebius, [History of the Church] iv. 6.) --- The people were not indeed removed together, as they had been. But all this is verified only in the Church, which in the midst of persecutions always subsists. Theodoret thinks these promises were conditional with regard to the Jews.'
      v:013:
        - 'EZK:36:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Men.</i> This remark was very ancient, Numbers xiii. 33. Wars had almost always raged in the country. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - "EZK:36:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>More.</i> This whole promise principally relates to the Church of Christ, and God's perpetual protection of her; for as to the carnal Jews, they have been removed out of their land these sixteen hundred years. (Challoner)"

(Calmet) --- The Jews had provoked God to punish them with captivity; and hence the nations took occasion to blaspheme, that he could not protect them. (Worthington)'
      v:022:
        - 'EZK:36:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Holy,</i> that my attributes of justice and mercy may be confessed, Isaias xlviii. 2., Daniel iii. 49., and Judith viii. 24.'
      v:025:
        - 'EZK:36:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Water.</i> R. David and the Chaldean explain this of the remission of sin; and all Christians understand it of baptism in water, remitting all offences, Ephesians v. 26., and Titus iii. 5. (Worthington) --- He alludes to the purification of the Jews, which prefigured baptism and penance, in which the blood of Christ is applied to our souls. This of course was only fulfilled in his church.'
      v:026:
        - 'EZK:36:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Flesh.</i> The Jews at their return fell not so often into the sins of idolatry, &c., of which the prophets complained. But yet they were far from answering this character. Great irregularities prevailed under Nehemias, and in the days of the Machabees the priests publicly worshipped idols, 1 Esdras ix., and 2 Esdras v., and viii., and 2 Machabees iv., and v. Christ enables his servants to act with purity unto the end, by the influence of his all-powerful grace. (Calmet)'
      v:027:
        - 'EZK:36:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Do them.</i> Hence the efficacy of grace appears, (St. Augustine; Haydock) and hereby some keep the commandments. (Worthington) --- God assists our free-will. (Theodoret) (Cornelius a Lapide) (Calmet)'
      v:037:
        - 'EZK:36:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Find.</i> Hebrew, "seek." I will cause great multitudes to come to the solemn feast. This was seen still more after the conversion of the Gentiles. (Calmet)'

The prophet glued the pieces of wood together, or engrafted them one into the other, to shew that all the people should be united, and the Jews and Gentiles concur to form one church. (Calmet) (Romans xi. 17.) --- Before the latter event took place God united the two kingdoms, to teach us that when we labour for the conversion of heretics, as in England, Catholics must first agree among themselves, that so all may more easily become <i>one fold</i> under <i>one shepherd.</i> (Worthington)'

      v:002:
        - 'EZK:38:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Gog.</i> This name, which signifies <i>hidden,</i> or <i>covered,</i> is taken in this place either for the persecutors of the Church of God in general, or some arch persecutor in particular; such as Antichrist shall be in the latter days. See Apocalypse xx. 8. And what is said of the punishment of Gog, is verified by the unhappy end of persecutors. --- <i>Magog.</i> Scythia or Tartary, whence the Turks and other enemies of the Church of Christ originally sprung. (Challoner) --- These are supposed to be the princes of some northern and barbarous country, (Worthington) peopled by the son of Japhet. (St. Jerome) --- St. Augustine (City of God xx. 11.) observes, that as the Church is spread everywhere, so also are persecutors. But Christ will overcome them all. (Worthington) --- This prophecy is very difficult. It seems literally to refer to Cambyses, who invaded Judea about seventy years after the temple had been destroyed, and perished by the hand of God, at Ecbatana, upon Mount Carmel. It is very usual with the prophets to give fictitious names; as the king of Tyre is called a <i>cherub,</i> and Jerusalem <i>Ooliba.</i> Cambyses ruled over Scythia, in Iberia; styled Gogarene, by Strabo (xi.). (Calmet) --- The proper Scythia withstood all the attempts of his successors, and defeated Darius. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'EZK:38:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Jaws.</i> Thus Cambyses treated the son of Psammenites. God has the most absolute dominion over all monarchs, ver. 7.'
      v:008:
        - 'EZK:38:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Visited,</i> or rather "shall visit" Judea. (Chaldean) (Grotius) --- Cambyses invaded Egypt twelve years after the Jews had returned, and came upon them two years later, designing to plunder them, at the instigation of their malevolent neighbours. He had sustained great losses in Egypt, and was arrived at Carmel when news was brought that the false Smerdis had declared himself king. See Herodotus iii. 61.'
      v:012:
        - 'EZK:38:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Midst.</i> Literally, "navel." Hebrew, "Thabor," intimating a mountain rising in a plain, Judges ix. 7. (Calmet) --- Alluding to this intended blunder of the Jews lately returned, he speaks of Antichrist and of all heretics, who seek to pervert or suppress Catholics rescued from the power of the devil, by the sacraments of Christ. (Worthington)'
      v:013:
        - 'EZK:38:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Tharsis.</i> Septuagint, "Carthage, and all their villages." The merchants or naval forces of Cambyses spurred him forward, (see Psalm lxxvii. 6.) as well as the Arabs, Cuthites, &c., 1 Esdras iv. 8. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'EZK:38:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Latter.</i> Antichrist shall persecute the Church at the end of the world. (Worthington) --- After Cambyses had punished Egypt, his turn came, and all his designs were baffled.'

      v:021:
        - 'EZK:38:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Sword.</i> The Jews were not in a condition to make resistance. (Calmet) --- Cambyses had his brother Smerdis slain. But another was set on the throne; whereupon, mounting his horse in a fury, he wounded himself with his sword in the thigh, which mortifying, caused his death after twenty days. (Herodotus iii. 21., &c.) --- The historian does not mention what became of his army; but it seems to have perished by discord, as was very common among such a collection of nations. See Judges vii. 22., and Judith xv. 1., and 1 Kings xiv. 20., and 4 Kings ii. 21. (Calmet) --- They were now without a head. (Haydock) --- In the whole universe, God will at last destroy Antichrist and all his adherents. (Worthington)'

The Jews immediately after his death recommence the building of the temple, (1 Esdras iv.; Aggeus i. 14.) which they are forced to discontinue, till Hystaspes confirmed the decree of Cyrus. This was the grand object of their desires, and therefore the day when Cambyses fell was ever memorable to them. (Calmet, Diss.) --- So will that be for Christians, when Antichrist shall be no more.

        - "EZK:40:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Month;</i> April 30, the year of the world 3430. (Usher) (Calmet) --- In explaining this last most obscure vision: <b>I.</b> The Jews say it was verified after the captivity. But thus the temple would be four miles round, and the city thirty-six, which never was the case. <b>II.</b> Hence more modern Jews assert it will be fulfilled by the Messias. <b>III.</b> Rejecting these errors, Lyranus, &c., suppose that the promise was conditional, and that the sins of the Jews prevented the city and temple from being so large; and that the mystical temple of the Church is also insinuated, into which both Jews and Gentiles shall enter. <b>IV.</b> Though this opinion be probable, it seems better to follow St. Jerome, St. Gregory, &c., who cannot apply all to the Old Testament, nor think that such a huge temple and city were indeed promised, but explain some parts of the captives at their return, as a figure of those redeemed by Christ, and brought into his Church, which is adorned with all graces. Yet the greatest part must be understood of the Church triumphant. (Worthington) --- St. Jerome confesses his ignorance of this subject; and those who have come after him, though they imitate not his modesty, add little to dissipate the mist with which this vision is surrounded. Some have adhered too close to Josephus, while Villalpand has here discovered all the magnificence of Greek and Roman architecture, and has represented the temple six times as large as it really was. It seems that the prophet has described the same temple of Solomon which he had seen, that the dimensions might be preserved, and the hopes of the people kept up; (Calmet) and that they might comprehend what a loss they actually sustained on account of their sins, (Haydock) and might strive to come up to this pattern (Du Hamel) as \"near as they should be able,\" the wealth of the people being much less than Solomon's. (Grotius) --- These arguments do not, however, shew that the buildings were to resemble each other. They vary in many particulars; and the prophet would specify what was to be really executed. He says nothing of the ornamental part, and little of the height, which are the most expensive. (Houbigant) (Preface) --- If some things appear to be too grand for the temple of Solomon, and of Zorobabel, we must reflect that the prophet passes from the figure to the Church of Christ, which is not unusual. (Menochius) --- Alcasar and Bossuet explain it wholly of the Church, so that the letter requires few notes. (Du Hamel)"
      v:002:
        - 'EZK:40:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Mountain;</i> Moria, in spirit. On the eastern side, the road to the city was level. Walls were added after the captivity, on the other sides. (Josephus, Jewish Wars vi. 6.) --- <i>City,</i> the temple was so large. --- <i>South,</i> to one coming from the north, though the temple lay on that side of the town, Psalm xlvii. 2. (Calmet) --- Septuagint read <i>mongod,</i> "over-against," instead of <i>mongob,</i> "south," which has perplexed many. (Houbigant) --- Ezechiel was placed on Sion, which was not <i>very high,</i> but here it denotes the Church. Jerusalem was in ruins. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - 'EZK:40:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Brass:</i> shining. (Haydock) --- This angel waited for the prophet at the northern gate, but introduced him by that looking towards the east, ver. 16. --- <i>Line.</i> It seems never to have been used. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - "EZK:40:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Breadth.</i> Hebrew, Chaldean, Septuagint, \"of six cubits, in a cubit and a palm;\" intimating that the sacred cubit contained six palms, while the common one had only five, (chap. xliii. 13.; Worthington) being half a yard; (Arbuthnot) or the Hebrew cubit was a hand's breadth larger than the Babylonian, or about 21½ inches, (Calmet) which may be styled (Menochius) the sacred cubit. (Arbuthnot) (Haydock) --- <i>Reed.</i> This outer wall (Calmet; Menochius) was to prevent any from falling down the precipice. It was about four yards nine inches in height and thickness, being so solid in order that the ground might not give way. Josephus describes prodigious walls, (Haydock) reaching to the bottom of the mountain, three hundred cubits on the south and west; but then the temple was much enlarged. (Calmet)"
      v:006:
        - 'EZK:40:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>And.</i> In this verse occurs the first of thirty-four words where the <i>j</i> is allowed by the keri to be omitted in this one chapter, always when it is the sign of the plural number before a suffixed <i>v,</i> and of course by voluntary assimilation. But Camb. Manuscript has the <i>j</i> regularly in the thirty-two of these words. (Kennicott) --- <i>Steps.</i> The ground was not quite level, which caused the buildings to rise one above another more elegantly. There were four great gates.'
      v:007:
        - 'EZK:40:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Chamber,</i> for the porters, (Calmet) three on each side of the porch, ver. 10. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'EZK:40:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Thirteen,</i> or twenty-six feet high.'
      v:014:
        - 'EZK:40:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Cubits</i> high, or else the elevation is nowhere specified. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - "EZK:40:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Slanting,</i> or \"lattice.\" Septuagint, \"dark.\" See 3 Kings vii. 4. (Haydock) --- They were larger within, to afford light, as in Solomon's temple, and in castles. Interpreters disagree in their sentiments: but all allow that God here insinuated that he would reward people in the Old Testament with temporal, and those in the New with spiritual blessings; first with grace in this life, and with glory in the next. (Worthington) --- Yet we must not suppose that the saints of old were deprived of eternal goods. (Haydock) --- <i>About.</i> The other gates had the like ornaments. (Calmet)"
      v:017:
        - 'EZK:40:17 | 17 | 17 | There were <i>chambers. Gazophylacia,</i> so called, because the priests and Levites kept in them the stores and vessels that belonged to the temple. (Challoner) --- They went all round the courts. The women were in the second story. Villalpand and Capel, who are deemed the most accurate, suppose that there were no chambers below, but an open gallery. There seem, however, to have been chambers also, chap. viii. 7. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - 'EZK:40:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Lower.</i> So that there was a step up to the threshold. (Haydock) --- Marble was used in all places exposed to the weather. (Josephus, Jewish Wars vi. 14.)'
      v:026:
        - 'EZK:40:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Seven.</i> There were eight to the inner court, (ver. 31.) shewing that more perfection is now required, and a greater reward given. (St. Gregory) (Worthington)'
      v:030:
        - 'EZK:40:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Five cubits.</i> The parallel passages would intimate "fifty." (Calmet) (Villalpand) --- But the texts all read five, and Maldonat understands the four vacant spaces between the chambers, ver. 7. (Menochius)'
      v:038:
        - 'EZK:40:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Gates.</i> Hebrew is very obscure. The holocausts were slain on the north side of the altar, Leviticus i. 11.'
      v:043:
        - 'EZK:40:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Borders,</i> to prevent any thing falling. Chaldean, &c., have "hooks."'
      v:044:
        - EZK:40:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>North.</i> The singers occupied two wings.
      v:045:
        - 'EZK:40:45 | 45 | 45 | <i>Watch</i> over the sacred ornaments, perfumes, lamps of the sanctuary, &c., Numbers iii. 28.'
      v:046:
        - 'EZK:40:46 | 46 | 46 | <i>Altar.</i> Not on actual service, (chap. xli. 13.) but to prepare the victims.'
      v:048:
        - 'EZK:40:48 | 48 | 48 | <i>That side.</i> Septuagint add, "and the opening ({GREEK:START euros}ηυροσ{GREEK:END}, width) of the gate was 14 cubits, and the breadth (projections, {GREEK:START epomides}ηπωιδησ{GREEK:END}) of the," &c., (Haydock) or the wall on each side of the door was three cubits, so that the porch was 20 cubits broad. (Calmet)'
      v:049:
        - "EZK:40:49 | 49 | 49 | <i>Eleven.</i> 3 Kings vi., says <i>ten.</i> The exact breadth was ten and a half, (Villalpand; Tirinus) or what the pavement covered is there specified according to some. Roman Septuagint has \"twelve.\" But the edition of Basil reads more correctly, ten. (Calmet) --- Yet both ten and eleven may be right, if this temple be different. (Haydock) --- <i>Eight.</i> Hebrew seems corrupt, <i>a</i> being substituted for <i>a.</i> \"They mounted by ten steps,\" as the Septuagint read. Aquila has eleven; Symmachus [has] eight. --- <i>Pillars</i> of brass, 3 Kings vii. 15. (Calmet) --- As they are not measured, they were like Solomon's. (Worthington)"

      v:002: 'EZK:40:2 | 2 | 2 | In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain: upon which there was as the building of a city, bending towards the south.'
      v:003: 'EZK:40:3 | 3 | 3 | And he brought me in thither: and behold a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed in his hand: and he stood in the gate.'
      v:004: 'EZK:40:4 | 4 | 4 | And this man said to me: Son of man, see with thy eyes, and hear with thy ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall shew thee: for thou art brought hither that they may be shewn to thee: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.'

      v:017: 'EZK:40:17 | 17 | 17 | And he brought me into the outward court, and behold <i>there were</i> chambers, and a pavement of stone in the court round about: thirty chambers encompassed the pavement.'

      v:001:
        - "EZK:41:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>The temple.</i> This plan of a temple, which was here shewn to the prophet in a vision, partly had relation to the material temple, which was to be rebuilt: and partly, in a mystical sense, to the spiritual temple of God, the Church of Christ. (Challoner) --- The description seems grander than Solomon's; and yet Zorobabel's temple was meaner than his. Hence this prophecy, and those of Aggeus and Zacharias, cannot be understood of it, but of the Church. (St. Jerome; St. Augustine, City of God xviii. 45.) (Worthington)"
      v:003:
        - 'EZK:41:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Front,</i> or door-posts. The temple was 20 cubits broad.'
      v:005:
        - "EZK:41:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Four.</i> Herein it differed from Solomon's chambers, which were in breadth five, six, and seven cubits, in the three stories, respectively. (Calmet)"

        - 'EZK:41:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>One by another,</i> or <i>one over another:</i> literally, <i>side to side,</i> or <i>side upon side.</i> (Challoner) --- The word <i>side</i> is here equivocal, like Hebrew <i>tsela,</i> sometimes denoting the boards, and at other times the apartments round the temple, except on the west, over against the sanctuary, which seems to be the case here. It is true, we shall not easily find sixty-six chambers. But the Hebrew, &c., have only thirty-three. (Calmet) --- Villalpand rightly translated <i>anterides,</i> (ver. 5.) but here he substitutes <i>trabes,</i> "beams or thick planks," to make it agree with 3 Kings vi. 6., as if the same temple were meant. He also adopts the Vulgate <i>bis.</i> --- <i>Twice.</i> Hebrew <i>pehamim.</i> Yet he afterwards places in his commentary, <i>pedes,</i> "thirty-three feet, that is twenty-two cubits," though feet are never used at all as a measure in Scripture. (Houbigant)'

        - 'EZK:41:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Broader,</i> as the wall was not so thick. (Haydock) --- <i>Midst.</i> The two staircases were round in the hollow of the wall, (Menochius) at the eastern end of the chambers. (Josephus) See 3 Kings. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - 'EZK:41:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>House.</i> Because these side-chambers were in the very walls of the temple all around: or it may also be rendered, (more agreeably to the Hebrew) so as to signify, that the thickness of the wall for the side-chambers within was the same as that of the wall without; that is, equally five cubits. (Challoner) --- Protestants, "and that which was left, <i>was</i> the place of the side-chambers that <i>were</i> within." (Haydock) --- To manifest a greater respect for God, the apartments of the priests were twenty-five cubits distant from the temple, (ver. 10.) and divided by a wall, which Josephus describes as three cubits high. (Antiquities viii. 2.) This wall was at the distance of five cubits from the temple. (Calmet)'

(Haydock)"
      v:015:
        - 'EZK:41:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Galleries; Ethecas,</i> or as the more correct manuscripts of St. Jerome read, <i>Ecthetas,</i> seems to be formed from (Calmet) Hebrew <i>athikim,</i> (Haydock) which St. Jerome explains a balcony, portico, or gallery.'

        - 'EZK:41:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>About.</i> Thus he intimates the inner temple, which was covered with boards. --- <i>Windows.</i> The temple was hidden so far by the chambers; or rather he measured (Calmet) "the ground <i>and</i> up to the windows, which were" shut up with lattices, affording light over the doors (Haydock) and apartments, fifteen cubits from the ground.'
      v:018:
        - 'EZK:41:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Two.</i> Before he describes them with four faces. But they varied, (Exodus xxv. 18.) or the other two might be against the wall. (Calmet) --- The cherub signified "knowledge," and the palm-tree victory, to shew that man must be instructed with divine knowledge, and so fight for the victory. The face of man implied that Christ would suffer, and that of a lion announced that he would overcome all his enemies. (Worthington)'
      v:021:
        - 'EZK:41:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>The threshold was four-square.</i> That is, the gate of the temple <i>was four-square,</i> and so placed as to answer the gate of the sanctuary within. (Challoner) --- It was not an arch, though not a perfect square, 3 Kings vi. 34.'

The glorious chariot entered by the eastern gate, and the prophet followed to the court of the priests, ver. 5, 13. (Calmet) --- The Jews say the second temple was deprived of the <i>Shekinah,</i> or glory of the Lord. Yet it seems here to enter; and Christ himself adorned this second house, more than the first, by his adorable presence, Aggeus ii. 8. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - 'EZK:43:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Said.</i> The Lord spoke, (Chaldean; Theodoret) or the angel, (St. Jerome) in human shape.

Yet the perfect Church, <i>without spot,</i> is the [Church] triumphant [in heaven]; (Ephesians v. 27.; Worthington) though the Catholic Church, on earth, is ever holy and "the communion of saints." (Haydock) --- <i>Carcasses.</i> Idols, according to some; or rather by the kings being buried on Sion. This is nowhere else reprehended; neither is their building too near the temple, which the prophet here condemns, ver. 8. (Calmet) --- It seems, however, that if these things had been blameable, such a number of pious and wise kings would not have acted thus, nor the prophets have neglected to admonish them of their duty. The carcasses and houses here specified may have been vestiges of idolatry; or, in future, the tombs and palaces were to be at a more respectful distance. (Haydock)'

The Asmonean princes erected the famous tower Antonia, at the north side. (Josephus) See ver. 8. The Jews assert that it was unlawful to spit on this ground, &c., but no such thing is specified in Josephus or in Scripture, only we find that none were to go out by the same door at which they had entered, (chap. xlvi. 9.; Calmet) except the king.'

Some assert that the priests stood on this base to avoid treading on the altar, when they placed the wood or victims. But it would be too low; and steps were made for that purpose. The altar was ten, or rather twelve cubits high, and as many broad. Solomon's was ten high and twenty broad. Herod's was a square of forty cubits, raised fifteen from the ground. (Calmet)"

(Challoner) --- Fire descending sometimes from heaven. (St. Jerome) (Worthington) --- It also appeared like a little <i>mountain</i> in the court. See Isaias xxix. 1. The altar was probably made of brass, like Solomon's. Josephus and Philo say that rough stones were used after the captivity: but it seems little attention was paid to the dimensions of the temple, &c., given by Ezechiel. (Calmet) --- Yet the prophets were present to see the laws of God executed, and never complain of their infringement in these particulars, which were attended with no great difficulty, chap. xl. 1.

        - "EZK:45:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>By lot.</i> Manuscript 2 reads <i>bogurl;</i> (printed <i>benachala</i>) so the Vulgate <i>sortito.</i> (Kennicott) --- Hebrew, \"when you shall make the land fall,\" which usually implies by lot: yet the partition was not made thus, (chap. xlviii. 1.) nor at all, (Calmet) otherwise the prophet might mention how the lots would have fallen to Dan, in the north, &c. (Haydock) --- The Jews either could not comply, or did not take this to be a command. If they had returned all together, they might probably have put it in execution. But many of them preferred staying where they had gotten a settlement, and the rest only returned in small parties, some not before the reign of Alexander [the Great]. Those who arrived first, occupied as much as possible their ancient limits, 1 Esdras iii. 1., and 2 Esdras viii., and xi. (Calmet) --- <i>Thousand:</i> reeds, or cubits. (Challoner) --- Many prefer the latter, which is specified [in] ver. 2., (Haydock) as it agrees with the dimensions of the temple, chap. xlii. 16. If <i>reeds</i> or <i>toises</i> were meant, the city would be disproportionate with the rest of the divisions: 50,000 would make 25 leagues, of 2,500 paces each; and if each tribe had as much, the country must have comprised 325 leagues, whereas from Emath to Cadesbarne (chap. xlvii. 17.) there at[are?] not above 150. (Calmet) --- To form an idea of the proposed partition, we must suppose the country reached from a little north of Emesa, on the Orontes, to Cadesbarne south, and from the Mediterranean to Damascus, or a little farther east, and beyond the sources of Jazer. <b>1.</b> Dan, <b>2.</b> Aser, <b>3.</b> Nephthali, <b>4.</b> Manasses, <b>5.</b> Ephraim, <b>6.</b> Ruben, and <b>7.</b> Juda, had about equal portions with that designed for <b>8.</b> the temple, the Levites, and prince, whose southern limits reached almost to Accaron and the Dead Sea. <b>9.</b> Benjamin, <b>10.</b> Simeon, <b>11.</b> Issachar, <b>12.</b> Zabulon, and <b>13.</b> Gad, had each about half the quantity of the others, though the tribes occupied the whole extent from east to west, their lots being marked out by parallel lines. Between Juda and Benjamin, a square of 500 cubits was assigned for the temple; another square of 4,500, or 18,000 in circuit, lay round the former for the city of the Levites: round this were suburbs 250 cubits broad, walled about, and having three gates on each side. Next them dwelt their lay servants, in a space 5,000 cubits broad, and 25,000 long, from east to west. A plot of ground on the north and south, sufficient to complete this square was to support them with provisions. On the east side of the Jordan, and on the west of this square for the priests and their servants, two portions almost of equal dimensions with it, were appropriated to the prince. His lot was 25,000 cubits long, and 12,500 broad, chap. xlviii. 21. See Calmet's plan. (Haydock) --- <i>About.</i> It could not be alienated to private men, or for any other purpose. (Worthington)"

David and other Jews, understand this of the Messias and the rites of his Church, with a literal allusion to the old law.

        - "EZK:46:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Sacrifice.</i> See chap. xlv. 24. Flour and oil accompanied the victim. When lambs were presented, this was left to the prince's devotion (ver. 7, 11.; Calmet) only. If he gave three or four <i>ephies</i> of flour, he must give as many <i>hins</i> of <i>oil.</i> (Haydock)"
      v:006:
        - 'EZK:46:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Calf.</i> Moses orders two, and seven lambs, Numbers xxviii. 11. (Calmet) --- <i>The rams.</i> Hebrew, "a ram. They shall," &c. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'EZK:46:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>It,</i> perhaps to avoid confusion, (Menochius) and turning the back on the temple, (Calmet) or to exercise their obedience. As many might enter by one gate as by another, and thus the concourse would not be diminished. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - 'EZK:46:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Out.</i> The prince went in and out by the same gate, (ver. 8.) and might order that on the east to be opened when he had to offer a voluntary sacrifice. In other respects he was like a simple Israelite, and was to attend the temple and use the same gates as the rest. Before, the kings had a gate on the west leading to their palace. But this was no longer to subsist, and the palace was to be far removed, chap. xlviii. 21.'
      v:011:
        - 'EZK:46:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Solemnities.</i> Hebrew, "on feasts and on days of meeting." (Calmet) --- <i>Sacrifice: mincha,</i> ver. 7., and chap. xlv. 24. (Haydock)'

      v:017:
        - 'EZK:46:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Sons.</i> If any portion of his land was made over to them, it still remained in the family; but if any other had a present of it, the land must revert to the royal family, agreeably to the law, Leviticus xxv. 10. (Calmet) --- This insinuates that works done by the true children of God, in the state of grace, merit an eternal reward, while moral good works performed in the state of sin, can only have a temporal one. (Worthington)'
      v:019:
        - 'EZK:46:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Gate,</i> on the north, chap. xliv. 4. --- <i>West.</i> At this corner was the kitchen for victims, which could only be eaten in the inner court. If they had been brought into that without, the people would have become unclean; as it is equally wrong to touch holy or impure things when they are forbidden, chap. xliv. 19. There were four other kitchens for the people who might choose to eat their peace-offerings, ver. 24. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - 'EZK:46:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Little.</i> Hebrew, "courts joined;" (Protestants) or marginal note, "made with chimneys," (Haydock) or "smoked," as no chimneys were used. Septuagint, "little courts," as they have read differently. (Calmet) --- Vulgate unites both meanings. (Haydock)'

        - 'EZK:47:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Waters.</i> These waters are not to be understood literally, (for there were none such that flowed from the temple) but mystically of the baptism of Christ, and of his doctrine and his grace; the trees that grow on the banks are Christian virtues; the fishes are Christians, that spiritually live in and by these holy waters; the fishermen are the apostles, and apostolic preachers; the fenny places, where there is no health, are such as by being out of the Church are separated from these waters of life. (Challoner) --- It is not probable that real water or fishes were found, ver. 9. But this must be explained of the Church and of baptism, in a higher and more proper sense. (Worthington) --- Joel, (iii. 18.) before the captivity, and Zacharias, (xiv. 8.) after that event, speak of fountains as still <i>to appear,</i> and of course not in either temple, though Pilate made aqueducts for the purpose, (Josephus, Jewish Wars ii. 13.) which Tacitus, (An. v.) Maundrel, (p. 148.) and others mention. But the prophets allude not to them, but to Christ, the fountain of water springing up unto life eternal, John iv. 14., and vii. 38. (Calmet) --- Villalpand understands it of waters brought into the temple to wash the victims; but it seems to refer more to the grace and doctrine of Christ. (Menochius)'
      v:002:
        - 'EZK:47:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>East.</i> This gate was shut, and therefore he went out at the north gate. (Calmet)'

But this passage relates to the Dead Sea alone, (ver. 18.) and <i>Gelilah</i> is a place near it, where the Israelites erected an altar of union, Josue xxii. 10. (Calmet) --- <i>Healed.</i> No fish can live in the sea of Sodom. (Solin xxxviii.) --- Yet, let the place be ever so noxious, this water shall cure it; (see 4 Kings ii. 19.; Calmet) which must be taken in a mystical sense. (Haydock)'

        - 'EZK:47:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>First-fruits,</i> or most excellent. (Haydock) --- St. John saw such (Worthington) a <i>tree of life,</i> Apocalypse xxii. (Haydock) --- The doctrine of the gospel, and the study of the sacred books, have the most salutary effects; while the very <i>leaves,</i> or the example of the saints, heal the soul. No more shall the deceitful fruits near Sodom be seen (Calmet) beautiful, but full of nothing but ashes. (Tacitus, An. v.) --- Where Christ instructs, a torrent of grace and glory is presently formed. Like the mustard seed growing into a large tree, in which the birds rest, its origin is mean; yet its progress is grand and astonishing.'

      v:014:
        - 'EZK:47:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Brother.</i> The seven tribes to the north have each an equal share, as the five who lay to the south of the Levites had with respect to each other, though their portion must have been only about half of what the former possessed, according to the map, chap. xlv. 1. (Haydock) --- Under Josue, the numbers of each tribe were considered. The present mysterious equality shews, perhaps, that there is no distinction of Jew or Gentile in the Church, and that Christ would come to redeem all. (Calmet) --- <i>Lifted.</i> People taking an oath acted in this manner. (Menochius)'

      v:013: 'EZK:47:13 | 13 | 13 | Thus saith the Lord God: This is the border, by which you shall possess the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: for Joseph hath a double portion.'
      v:014: 'EZK:47:14 | 14 | 14 | And you shall possess it, every man in like manner as his brother: concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for a possession.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'EZK:48:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Dan.</i> This division is very different from that of Josue, and was never literally executed, being rather of a mystical nature. The limits are not marked out, as each lot was equal. (Calmet) See chap. xlv. 1., and xlvii. 14. (Haydock) --- By the twelve tribes all the glorified saints are meant. No cities of refuge occur, because in heaven all are perfect, all secure. (St. Jerome) (Worthington)'
      v:008:
        - 'EZK:48:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Apart,</i> for the Levitical tribe and the prince. (Calmet) --- As the first-born and things which spring first, so also the land consecrated to the Lord is called first-fruits. (Worthington) --- <i>Thousand</i> cubits (chap. xlv. 1.) or 12,500 paces, (Haydock) allowing two cubits for each. This would not reach to the Jordan River. But thrice that space must be reckoned, the king having two of them (Calmet) on each side of the temple, namely, towards the sea, and on the other side of the Jordan. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'EZK:48:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Astray,</i> &c. By this we see, that in the worst of times God always preserved some of the priests from going astray; and that the synagogue never fell so universally into idolatry, but that a remnant was still left free from this corruption. (Challoner)'
      v:013:
        - 'EZK:48:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Ten.</i> Their city was only 18,000 cubits in circumference, ver. 16.'
      v:015:
        - 'EZK:48:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Profane,</i> where servants of the priests may reside. (Calmet) --- On the north and south, (Haydock) 1000 cubits broad and 25,000 long were left for fields, gardens, &c. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'EZK:48:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Five.</i> Hebrew has, "five five hundred:" but one <i>five</i> is properly omitted in several manuscripts and in all the ancient versions. (Kennicott) --- Four thousand five hundred cubits was the length and breadth of the town and temple, which were 18,000 cubits round, (Calmet) or so many reeds, which would make 36 miles of 1000 paces each. As the earthly Jerusalem was certainly never so large, the modern rabbins assert that the Messias will build it to that extent; but Catholic doctors understand it mystically of the Church. Thus St. John saw the New Jerusalem or Church triumphant [in heaven], Apocalypse xxi., and xxii. (Worthington)'
      v:017:
        - 'EZK:48:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Suburbs,</i> separating the Levites from laics, different from what is mentioned [in] ver. 15.'
      v:018:
        - 'EZK:48:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>As the,</i> &c. They shall not be alienated, as some might infer from its being said to be <i>profane,</i> which term is used because it was the habitation of laymen.'
      v:019:
        - 'EZK:48:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Israel.</i> People from all parts might serve the Levites. This tribe was not to engage in labourious or sordid employments, being attached to the service of the Lord, and bound to instruct others. But this was more perfectly fulfilled in the Christian Church, where the clergy enjoy great immunities, and are forbidden to exercise any trade or employment which may take them off from their more important spiritual concerns, or render their ministry contemptible. See Exodus xix. 6.'
      v:020:
        - 'EZK:48:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>City,</i> where the Levites and their servants, artisans, &c., dwelt. (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - 'EZK:48:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Thereof.</i> The domains of the prince touched the limits of Juda on the north, and of Benjamin on the south, as the portion of Levi did also. The prince occupied the east and west square of this division. (Haydock)'
      v:028:
        - 'EZK:48:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Inheritance.</i> Hebrew <i>nachal,</i> signifies also "torrent;" and St. Jerome seems to prefer this meaning, as he explains it of the torrent which goes by Rhinocorura, and is commonly supposed to be the southern boundary. (Calmet)'
      v:030:
        - 'EZK:48:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Out,</i> or gates. (Haydock) --- There were three on each of the four sides. (Calmet)'
      v:035:
        - 'EZK:48:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>The Lord is there.</i> This name is here given to the city; that is, the Church of Christ; because the Lord is always with her till the end of the world, Matthew xxviii. 20. (Challoner) --- He always adorns the Church triumphant [in heaven]; (Apocalypse xxii.) but has deserted the synagogue, Matthew xxiii. 38. (Worthington) --- Jerusalem certainly never bore this name, nor is it requisite that she should, if the prophecy had been literally understood. It would suffice, if she could justly claim such a prerogative. See Isaias vii. 14., and 2 Kings xii. 25. The Church of Christ possesses God for ever. (Calmet)'

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "<b>Ezechiel,</b> whose name signifies the <i>strength of God,</i> was of the priestly race, and of the number of the captives that were carried away to Babylon with king Joachin. He was contemporary with Jeremias, and prophesied to the same effect in Babylon as Jeremias did in Jerusalem; and is said to have ended his days in like manner, by martyrdom. (Challoner) --- He strove to comfort the captives, who began to repine that they had listened too readily to Jeremias, exhorting them to submit to the king of Babylon. Some think that part of his prophecies is lost, as Josephus mentions two books: but the nine last chapters, regarding the new city and temple, might form the second division. The Jews hesitated whether to allow his works to be canonical, as they seemed to differ from Moses, and from the dimensions given of Solomon's temple. But the same God might surely suggest some improvements, and the morality of the prophet is most excellent. (Calmet) --- His style may be compared to that of Homer (Grotius) and Alcæus. Many have thought that (Calmet) Pythagoras was his disciple; (Eusebius, præp. xiii.) yet the latter seems to have lived after the prophet, who was led into captivity with Jechonias, the year of the world 3410, and prophesied twenty years. He dates from this period, (Calmet) and from the renewal of the covenant under Josias, (chap. i. 1.; Haydock) when the captivity was first announced. (Worthington) --- The Jews allowed none to read the first and the nine (Haydock) last chapters, nor the beginning of Genesis, nor the Canticle of Canticles, before they were thirty years old; and they never attempted to explain the vision nor the building of the temple, supposing it to be above the power of man. (St. Jerome)"
