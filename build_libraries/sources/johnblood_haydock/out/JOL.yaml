    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JOL:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Planted.</i> Septuagint, "Bathuel." He was born in the tribe of Gad, at Bethaven, the town which Herod styles Livias, Josue xiii. 27. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'JOL:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Men.</i> Magistrates, and all who have children. (Haydock) He speaks to Juda, as the kingdom of Israel was ruined, chap. iii. 2. His principal object is to describe the ravages of locusts, and to exhort the people to repent, promising them better times after the captivity, and under the Messias, chap. ii. 28., and iii. 20. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'JOL:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Generation.</i> Prophecies relate to all future times, that people may see their accomplishment, (Worthington) and believe. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'JOL:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Left,</i> &c. Some understand this literally of the desolation of the land by these insects: others understand it of the different invasions of the Chaldeans, or other enemies. (Challoner) --- Jerusalem was four times plundered by the Babylonians, and every time worse than before, as these four sorts of destructive things shew. But we shall not enlarge upon these points, nor pursue the mystical sense of the prophets, which may be found in the fathers and Ribera. (Worthington) --- Others suppose that the Assyrians, Chaldeans, Greeks, (particularly Epiphanes) and Romans, are meant. We explain it simply of the devastation by insects. (Calmet) --- Four different species of locusts are denoted. (Bochart, p. 2. b. iv. 1.) --- <i>Mildew.</i> Hebrew <i>chasil,</i> (Haydock) is often rendered "a locust," by [the] Septuagint, (chap. ii. 25., &c.) and most suppose this is here the sense. The mildew destroys corn chiefly in low damp situations. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'JOL:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Sweet.</i> Hebrew, "wine, because of the sweet wine," (Haydock) or liquors extracted from fruit. The things which you have abused, are now taken away.'
      v:006:
        - 'JOL:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Nations.</i> Some understand the Assyrians or Chaldeans. But locusts are here styled a nation, Proverbs xxx. 25. --- <i>Lion.</i> Such locusts are described, Apocalypse ix. 8. (Calmet) --- "In India they are said to be three feet long, and their legs and thighs are used for saws when dried." (Pliny, [Natural History?] xi. 29.) --- They were attacked by regular troops in Syria. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xi. 29.)'
      v:008:
        - 'JOL:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Youth,</i> whom she espoused first. Such are more tenderly loved, particularly where polygamy prevails. (Calmet) --- So Dido speaks of Sichæus, Virgil, Æneid iv.:{JOIN}{BQ:2}Ille meos primus qui se mihi junxit amores{JOIN}{BQ:2}Abstulit, ille habeat secum servetque sepulchro.'
      v:009:
        - 'JOL:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Lord.</i> No harvest being reaped, the fruits could not be paid. Yet it is thought that what was requisite for sacrifice, would be procured from other countries. (Calmet) --- When Jerusalem was destroyed, sacrifices ceased. (Worthington)'
      v:012:
        - JOL:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Withered.</i> The bite of the locust corrupts the juice of plants.
      v:013:
        - 'JOL:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Go in</i> to the temple, or sleep on sackcloth, Judith iv. 9. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - "JOL:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Sanctify.</i> Appoint (Haydock) or proclaim a general fast, as was usual in such emergencies, 3 Kings xxi. 9., and 2 Paralipomenon xx. 3. Fasting and other good works are calculated to appease God's wrath. (Worthington)"
      v:015:
        - 'JOL:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Day.</i> Hebrew <i>ahah layom:</i> (Haydock) "Ah, what a day!" --- <i>Mighty.</i> Septuagint, "destruction." They have read in a different manner. God is about to give sentence, (Calmet) and to send Nabuchodonosor, (St. Jerome) or to destroy by famine, ver. 17.'
      v:016:
        - JOL:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>God.</i> None can bring the first-fruits. All appear in mourning.
      v:017:
        - 'JOL:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Dung.</i> Horse-dung dried for bedding, was used in the East instead of straw, (Busb. 3.) as it is still by the Arabs. (Darvieux 11.) --- Hebrew, "the seeds are rotten under their clods," (Haydock) finding no moisture. Septuagint, "the cows have stamped in their stalls;" or Syriac, "remain without food in their cribs." Chaldean, "the pitchers of wine have been corrupted under their covers," as there was no new wine. (Calmet) --- <i>Houses.</i> Hebrew <i>mammeguroth.</i> Protestants, "barns, (Haydock) or country houses;" which means cabins erected for the season, (Ruth ii. 7.) the <i>Magaria</i> (Calmet) or <i>Mopalia</i> of the Africans. (St. Jerome pref. Amos.) --- Septuagint, "the wine presses." Wine and corn were preserved in pits carefully covered over, Aggeus ii. 20. These fell to decay, as there was no use for them.'
      v:019:
        - "JOL:1:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Places.</i> Hebrew, \"dwellings,\" or shepherds' huts. --- <i>Wilderness,</i> denoting all pasture land unploughed."
      v:020:
        - 'JOL:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Up,</i> as if to pray for rain, Jeremias xiv. 6. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "cry," (Haydock) or "pant." --- <i>As....rain</i> is not in Hebrew or Septuagint. (Calmet)'

      v:002: 'JOL:1:2 | 2 | 2 | Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land: did this ever happen in your days, or in the days of your fathers?'
      v:003: 'JOL:1:3 | 3 | 3 | Tell ye of this to your children, and let your children tell their children, and their children to another generation.'
      v:004: 'JOL:1:4 | 4 | 4 | That which the palmer-worm hath left, the locust hath eaten: and that which the locust hath left, the bruchus hath eaten: and that which the bruchus hath left, the mildew hath destroyed.'
      v:005: 'JOL:1:5 | 5 | 5 | Awake, ye that are drunk, and weep, and mourn all ye that take delight in drinking sweet wine: for it is cut off from your mouth.'
      v:006: "JOL:1:6 | 6 | 6 | For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number: his teeth are like the teeth of a lion: and his cheek-teeth as of a lion's whelp."
      v:007: 'JOL:1:7 | 7 | 7 | He hath laid my vineyard waste, and hath pilled off the bark of my fig-tree: he hath stripped it bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.'
      v:008: JOL:1:8 | 8 | 8 | Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
      v:009: "JOL:1:9 | 9 | 9 | Sacrifice and libation is cut off from the house of the Lord: the priests, the Lord's ministers, have mourned:"
      v:010: 'JOL:1:10 | 10 | 10 | The country is destroyed, the ground hath mourned: for the corn is wasted, the wine is confounded, the oil hath languished.'
      v:011: 'JOL:1:11 | 11 | 11 | The husbandmen are ashamed, the vine-dressers have howled for the wheat, and for the barley, because the harvest of the field is perished.'
      v:012: 'JOL:1:12 | 12 | 12 | The vineyard is confounded, and the fig-tree hath languished: the pomegranate-tree, and the palm-tree, and the apple-tree, and all the trees of the field are withered: because joy is withdrawn from the children of men.'
      v:013: 'JOL:1:13 | 13 | 13 | Gird yourselves, and lament, O ye priests, howl, ye ministers of the altars: go in, lie in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: because sacrifice and libation is cut off from the house of your God.'
      v:014: 'JOL:1:14 | 14 | 14 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Sanctify ye a fast, call an assembly, gather together the ancients, all the inhabitants of the land into the house of your God: and cry ye to the Lord:'
      v:015: 'JOL:1:15 | 15 | 15 | Ah, ah, ah, for the day: because the day of the Lord is at hand, and it shall come like destruction from the mighty.'

      v:018: 'JOL:1:18 | 18 | 18 | Why did the beast groan, why did the herds of cattle low? because there is no pasture for them: yea, and the flocks of sheep are perished.'
      v:019: 'JOL:1:19 | 19 | 19 | To thee, O Lord, will I cry: because fire hath devoured the beautiful places of the wilderness: and the flame hath burnt all the trees of the country.'
      v:020: 'JOL:1:20 | 20 | 20 | Yea, and the beasts of the field have looked up to thee, as a garden bed that thirsteth after rain, for the springs of waters are dried up, and fire hath devoured the beautiful places of the wilderness.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'JOL:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Blow.</i> The prophets often ordered, to signify what will take place. (Worthington) --- The people were gathered by the sound of trumpets. The danger from the locusts was imminent; and all are exhorted to avert it, by praying in the temple, &c. --- <i>Tremble</i> at the sound, Amos iii. 6. (Calmet) --- <i>Extemplo turbati.</i> (Virgil, Æneid viii.) --- <i>Lord.</i> That is, the time when he will execute justice on sinners, (Challoner) and suffer affliction to fall upon them. (Worthington) (Chap. i. 15.)'
      v:002:
        - 'JOL:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Darkness.</i> This implies great misery, ver. 10. (Calmet) --- <i>People.</i> The Assyrians or Chaldeans. Others understand all this of the army of locusts laying waste the land. (Challoner) --- <i>Morning;</i> unexpectedly, (Calmet) and soon. (Haydock) --- No human force can prevent the ravages of the locusts --- <i>Beginning,</i> in Palestine. Moses says the same; but speaks of Egypt, Exodus x. 14.'
      v:003:
        - 'JOL:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Flame.</i> They destroy all by their bite, chap. i. 12. (Calmet) (Theodoret) --- <i>Pleasure.</i> Hebrew, "Eden." So luxuriant was Palestine.'
      v:004:
        - 'JOL:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Horsemen.</i> The head of a locust bears some resemblance with that of a horse, and its flight is rapid, Apocalypse ix. 7. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'JOL:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Mountains.</i> "They beat their wings so loudly, that they may be taken for other birds." (Pliny, [Natural History?] xi. 29.) --- They are much larger in hot climates, (chap. i. 6.; Haydock) and may be heard at the distance of two miles, (Bochart) darkening the air for the space of four leagues. Yet this description is poetical, and perhaps an allegory is nowhere better kept up.'
      v:006:
        - 'JOL:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Kettle.</i> The Jews were naturally of a dark complexion. Fear causing the blood to retire, would make them black, Isaias xiii. 8., Lamentations iv. 8., and v. 10. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'JOL:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Ranks.</i> Locusts march like a regular army. (Theodoret) --- No fortification can keep them out. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - "JOL:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Brother.</i> St. Jerome saw a cloud of them in Judea. They were not \"a finger-nail's breadth from each other.\" (Calmet) --- The Arabs discover the military art in them. (Bochart) --- They invested France (the year of the Lord 874) with all the skill of an army, the chiefs marking out the place for the camp the night before. (Sigebert.) --- <i>Windows.</i> They eat the wood, (Haydock) and the windows were simple lattices or curtains. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, \"they fall upon the sword, and shall not be hurt.\" Septuagint, \"consumed <i>or</i> filled.\" (Haydock) --- They are never satisfied. (Theodoret)"
      v:010:
        - 'JOL:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Shining.</i> The cloud of locusts intercepts the light; or, people in distress think all nature is in confusion. (St. Jerome; Ezechiel xxxii.; Jeremias iv. 23.) --- Aloysius (13.) saw locusts in the air for the space of twelve miles; and among the Cossacks, clouds of them may be found six leagues in length and three in breadth. They frequently occasion a famine in Ethiopia. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'JOL:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Voice;</i> thunder, (Haydock) or the noise of locusts, ver. 5. (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - 'JOL:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Mourning.</i> For moving the heart to repentance these external works are requisite, at least in will: if they be wilfully omitted, it is a sure sign that the heart is not moved. (St. Jerome) (Worthington)'
      v:013:
        - 'JOL:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Garments,</i> as was customary in great distress. God will not be satisfied with mere external proofs of repentance. (Calmet) --- <i>Evil.</i> He will forego his threats if we do penance. (St. Jerome) --- He punishes unwillingly, Isaias xxviii. 21.'
      v:014:
        - 'JOL:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Who knoweth.</i> Confidence in God and repentance must accompany prayer. --- <i>Blessing;</i> plentiful crops, so that the usual sacrifices may be performed again, chap. i. 9.'
      v:015:
        - 'JOL:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Trumpet.</i> Thus were festivals announced, Numbers x. 7.'
      v:016:
        - 'JOL:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Sanctify.</i> Let all make themselves ready to appear. --- <i>Ones.</i> Their cries would make an impression on men, and prevail on God to shew mercy, Judith iv. 9.'
      v:017:
        - 'JOL:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Altar</i> of holocausts. They turned towards the holy place, lying prostrate, 1 Esdras x. 1., and 2 Machabees x. 26. (Calmet) --- Hither the victim of expiation was brought, and the high priest confessed. (Maimonides) --- <i>Over them,</i> as they might easily have done during the famine.'
      v:018:
        - 'JOL:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Zealous.</i> Indignation is excited when a person perceives any thing contemned which he loves. So God resented the injuries done maliciously by the Gentiles towards his people; though he often punished them for their correction or greater merit. (Worthington) --- He will resent the blasphemies uttered by infidels against his holy name, and will restore fertility to the land. (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - 'JOL:2:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Nations.</i> This did not take place till after the seventy years captivity, nor then fully. It is verified in true believers, and after death in the glory of the saints. (Worthington)'
      v:020:
        - 'JOL:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>The northern</i> enemy. Some understand this of Holofernes and his army, others of the locusts. (Challoner) --- Protestants, "the northern <i>army.</i>" Hebrew may denote (Haydock) <i>wind.</i> This often drives away locusts. Those here spoken of were drowned in the Mediterranean and Dead Seas. (Calmet) --- This occasioned a pestilence, (St. Jerome; St. Augustine, City of God iv. 31.) to prevent which the locusts were to be speedily buried, Isaias xxxiii. 4. --- <i>Proudly.</i> Hebrew, "great things." God, or the locusts are meant.'
      v:022:
        - 'JOL:2:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Strength;</i> fruit, as formerly.'
      v:023:
        - 'JOL:2:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Teacher;</i> Joel, &c., or rather the Messias, John i. 9., and Matthew xxiii. 8. Some translate Hebrew, "rain." Septuagint, "meat," (Calmet) sufficient for the people. (Theodoret) --- <em>Rain</em>. Osee vi. 3.'
      v:024:
        - 'JOL:2:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Presses,</i> or subterraneous reservoirs.'
      v:025:
        - 'JOL:2:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Host.</i> God could have hurled his thunderbolts, or mountains, to destroy all mankind; but he chooses to shew their insignificance, (Calmet) by employing the vilest insects, which they cannot withstand. (St. Jerome)'
      v:028:
        - "JOL:2:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>After.</i> From this verse to the end the prophet speaks of the times succeeding the captivity, and more especially of the propagation of the gospel. The enemies of God's people shall be destroyed, (chap. iii. 1.) which seems to refer to Cambyses, Ezechiel xxxviii. (Calmet) --- <i>My spirit.</i> This plainly foretells the coming of the Holy Ghost, Acts ii. (Worthington) --- The Jews never had such a multitude of prophets after the captivity as the Church had, 1 Corinthians xiv. 24. What relates to them was only a shadow of what would befall true believers."
      v:029:
        - 'JOL:2:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Handmaids.</i> Septuagint of St. Jerome and St. Peter read, <i>my handmaids.</i> "My," is omitted in both places in Complutensian and Hebrew and the latter word in the Roman Septuagint.'
      v:030:
        - 'JOL:2:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Wonders.</i> Many prodigies preceded the persecution of Epiphanes, the death of Christ, the ruin of the temple, and more will be seen before the day of judgment. Though we cannot prove the same with respect to Cambyses, it suffices that the people were thrown into the utmost consternation (ver. 2, 11.) when he forebade the building of the temple, (1 Esdras iv. 6.) and designed to plunder them. Ezechiel (xxxviii. 11.) speaks of the same event, as the Jews assert. Ctesias also mentions that when he offered sacrifice, the victims would not bleed; and that his wife, Roxana, brought forth a child without a head, implying, according to the magi, that he should have no heir. His mother also frequently appeared, and reproached him with the murder of his brother. See chap. iii. 15., and Ezechiel xxxviii. 22.'
      v:032:
        - 'JOL:2:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Call.</i> Amid these fears, those who trust in the Lord shall have nothing to suffer. Cambyses could not execute his designs. But the prophet here alludes still more to the conversion of the Gentiles, Acts ii. 21., and Romans x. 13. Some returned from Babylon, as a figure of this great event. Only a few Jews embraced the faith. (Calmet) --- <i>Salvation.</i> Septuagint, "shall be saved, as the Lord hath spoken, and the person preaching the gospel, whom the Lord hath called." (Haydock)'

intro:
  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "<b>Joel</b>, whose name, according to St. Jerome, signifies <i>the Lord God,</i> (or, as others say, <i>the coming down of God</i>) prophesied about the same time in the kingdom of Juda as Osee did in the kingdom of Israel. He foretells, under figures, the great evils that were coming upon the people for their sins; earnestly exhorts them to repentance, and comforts them with the promise of a <i>teacher of justice,</i> viz., <i>Christ Jesus, our Lord,</i> and of the coming down of his <i>Holy Spirit</i> (Challoner) upon the hundred and twenty faithful assembled in Sion. [Acts i. 15. and ii. 4.] He describes the land of the twelve tribes made desolate, and the people cast off. (St. Jerome ad Paulin.) --- Yet he speaks chiefly of the kingdom of Juda, and mentions the house of God, sacrifices, &c. (Worthington) --- St. Jerome infers from his being placed after Osee, without any fresh title, (Calmet) that he lived in that order of time. (Worthington) --- But this rule is not general, as Jonas lived before Amos; and [the] Septuagint observe not the same disposition of the prophets as we do. The exact time of the famine, when Joel prophesied, cannot be ascertained. It seems he addressed the people in autumn, when a second year's famine was apprehended. He paints every thing with great force and beauty of style. (Calmet)"
