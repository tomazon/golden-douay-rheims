      v:001:
        - "DAG:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Third,</i> at the conclusion, so that it is called the <i>fourth,</i> Jeremias xxv. 1. (Cornelius a Lapide; Menochius) --- Nabuchodonosor began his expedition into Syria a year before he was king; (Salien, the year of the world 3428.; Josephus, &c.) or he had the title before his father Nabopolassar's death. (Usher, the year of the world 3397.) --- The following year he took Joakim, with a design to convey him to Babylon; but he left him on hard terms, and seized many of the sacred vessels, Daniel, &c. (Calmet) --- Joakim reigned other eight years, 2 Paralipomenon xxxvi. 5. (Worthington)"
      v:002:
        - 'DAG:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>His god; Bel,</i> or <i>Belas,</i> the principal idol of the Chaldeans. (Challoner) --- The king pretended to derive his pedigree from Belus, (Abyd. Eus. præp. 1.) and greatly enriched his temple, (Calmet) which Xerxes demolished. (Arrian.) --- <i>God.</i> Some part might be kept in the <i>palace,</i> chap. v. 10., and 2 Paralipomenon xxxvi. 7.'
      v:003:
        - 'DAG:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Eunuchs,</i> or chief officers. The Jews assert that Daniel was made an eunuch, Isaias xxxix. 7. But he might be so styled on account of his dignity. (Calmet) --- <i>Princes.</i> Literally, "tyrants." (Haydock) --- This name was afterwards only rendered odious by the misconduct of several kings. (Calmet) --- Hebrew <i>parthemim,</i> (Haydock) seems to be of Greek derivation, alluding to {GREEK:START protimoi}προτιμοι{GREEK:END}, or {GREEK:START protoi}προτοι{GREEK:END}, "the first or most honoured." (Drusius) --- We find here other Greek words. (Calmet)'
      v:004:
        - "DAG:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Blemish.</i> Deformed people were excluded the throne, or the king's presence. (Procop. 1.) --- <i>Science;</i> well educated, or apt to learn. They were first to be taught the Chaldean letters, which then differed from the Hebrew. (Calmet)"
      v:005:
        - "DAG:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Meat:</i> more exquisite. (De Dieu.) --- All was first served on the king's table. (Athen. vi. 14.)"
      v:006:
        - 'DAG:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Juda.</i> It is thought all four were of royal blood. (Calmet) --- Others were also kept at court. (Menochius)'
      v:007:
        - 'DAG:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Baltassar,</i> or as Chaldeans (Calmet) or Masorets (Haydock) pronounce, <i>Beltesasar,</i> "the treasurer of Baal." The names were changed to testify their subjection, (Calmet) and that they might embrace the manners of the Chaldeans. (Menochius) --- The new names alluded to the sun. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - 'DAG:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Daniel,</i> as head and nearer the throne, gave good example to the rest. (Worthington) --- <i>Defiled,</i> either by eating meat forbidden by the law, or which had before been offered to idols. (Challoner) --- It was customary among the pagans to make an offering of some parts to their gods, or throw it into the fire. (Theod.; Calmet) --- These reasons determined the pious youths, (Haydock) who desired also to keep free from gluttony and other vices. (Theod.; Worthington)'
      v:011:
        - 'DAG:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Malassar,</i> another inferior officer. It means also one appointed over the mouth or provisions, (Calmet) and might be Asphenez, ver. 3, 9. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - 'DAG:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Pulse.</i> That is, pease, beans, and such like. (Challoner) --- St. Basil hence shews the advantages of fasting; and Catholics, who imitate Daniel, may expect the like reward in heaven: and hope that such a pattern would not displease their dissenting brethren, but rather screen them from their profane sarcasms. (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - 'DAG:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Dreams.</i> He was learned in all the sciences of the country, like Moses, Acts vii. 22. (Calmet) --- They studied these things, in order to refute what was erroneous: <i>discunt....ut judicent.</i> (St. Jerome) --- The Chaldeans paid great attention to dreams. Daniel acquired the knowledge of such as were sent from heaven by the gift of God, as Joseph had done. To pay any regard to common dreams would be childish (Calmet) and sinful, if the person depend on them for the knowledge of futurity. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'DAG:1:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Diviners,</i> or fortune-tellers. --- <i>Wise men.</i> Septuagint, "philosophers." (Calmet) --- Hebrew <i>Ashaphim,</i> may come from the Greek {GREEK:START sophoi}σοφοι{GREEK:END}. (Grotius) --- They had been educated three years, ver. 5. (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - 'DAG:1:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Cyrus;</i> and also to the third, (Chap. x) and of course during the whole of the captivity. (Worthington) --- He was maintained in power by the conqueror of Babylon, chap. vi. 18., and xiv. 1. He first displayed his sagacity in the cause of Susanna, (Chap. xiii.; Calmet) whose history was placed at the head of the book, in Theodotion, (St. Jerome in Isaias iii. 1.) as in its natural order. (Calmet)'

      v:001: 'DAG:1:1 | 1 | 1 | In the third year {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}of the reign of Joakim, king of Juda, Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem, and besieged it.'
      v:002: 'DAG:1:2 | 2 | 2 | And the Lord delivered into his hands Joakim, the king of Juda, and part of the vessels of the house {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}of God: and he carried them away into the land of Sennaar, to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought into the treasure-house of his god.'
      v:003: "DAG:1:3 | 3 | 3 | And the king spoke to Asphenez, the master of the eunuchs, that he should bring in <i>some</i> of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes,"
      v:004: "DAG:1:4 | 4 | 4 | Children in whom there was no blemish, well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, acute in knowledge, and instructed in science, and such as might stand in the king's palace, that he might teach them the learning, and the tongue of the Chaldeans."
      v:005: 'DAG:1:5 | 5 | 5 | And the king appointed them a daily provision, of his own meat, and of the wine of which he drank himself, that being nourished three years, afterwards they might stand before the king.'
      v:006: 'DAG:1:6 | 6 | 6 | Now there were among them of the children of Juda, Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias.'
      v:007: 'DAG:1:7 | 7 | 7 | And the master of the eunuchs gave them names: to Daniel, Baltassar: to Ananias, Sidrach: to Misael, Misach: and to Azarias, Abdenago.'
      v:008: "DAG:1:8 | 8 | 8 | But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not be defiled with the king's table, nor with the wine which he drank: and he requested the master of the eunuchs that he might not be defiled."
      v:009: DAG:1:9 | 9 | 9 | And God gave to Daniel grace and mercy in the sight of the prince of the eunuchs.
      v:010: 'DAG:1:10 | 10 | 10 | And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel: I fear my lord, the king, who hath appointed you meat and drink: who if he should see your faces leaner than those of the other youths, your equals, you shall endanger my head to the king.'
      v:011: 'DAG:1:11 | 11 | 11 | And Daniel said to Malasar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias:'
      v:012: 'DAG:1:12 | 12 | 12 | Try, I beseech thee, thy servants for ten days, and let pulse be given us to eat, and water to drink:'
      v:013: "DAG:1:13 | 13 | 13 | And look upon our faces, and the faces of the children that eat of the king's meat: and as thou shalt see, deal with thy servants."
      v:014: 'DAG:1:14 | 14 | 14 | And when he had heard these words, he tried them for ten days.'
      v:015: "DAG:1:15 | 15 | 15 | And after ten days, their faces appeared fairer and fatter than all the children that ate of the king's meat."
      v:016: 'DAG:1:16 | 16 | 16 | So Malasar took their portions, and the wine that they should drink: and he gave them pulse.'
      v:017: 'DAG:1:17 | 17 | 17 | And to these children God gave knowledge, and understanding in every book, and wisdom: but to Daniel the understanding <i>also</i> of all visions and dreams.'
      v:018: 'DAG:1:18 | 18 | 18 | And when the days were ended, after which the king had ordered they should be brought in: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nabuchodonosor.'
      v:019: "DAG:1:19 | 19 | 19 | And when the king had spoken to them, there were not found among them all such as Daniel, Ananias, Misael, and Azarias: and they stood in the king's presence."
      v:020: 'DAG:1:20 | 20 | 20 | And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the diviners, and wise men, that were in all his kingdom.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'DAG:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Year,</i> from the death of his father, Nabopolassar; for he had reigned before as partner with his father, in the empire. (Challoner) --- In that quality he conquered Syria, (in the year of the world 3397) took Daniel, &c. in the year 3399. He succeeded his father. (Usher) (Calmet) --- After he had enlarged his empire by the conquest of Egypt, &c. he had this dream. (A. R. 25.[in the 25th year of his reign?]) (Worthington) --- <i>Mind.</i> Septuagint, "his sleep departed from him." (Haydock) --- He was restless, recollecting enough to fill him with trouble. When the dream was repeated over, he knew that it was the same. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'DAG:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>The Chaldeans.</i> That is, the astrologers, that pretended to divine by stars. (Challoner) --- They dwelt on the banks of the Euphrates, and were highly esteemed. (Diod. Sic. i.) --- They were the most ancient philosophers. (Civ. Div. i.)'
      v:003:
        - 'DAG:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>I know.</i> Hebrew also, "to know or understand what," &c.'
      v:004:
        - 'DAG:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Syriac.</i> It was originally the same as the Chaldean. Daniel understood this language, as well as Hebrew and writes in it what concerned the Chaldeans, to Chap. viii. This shews his accuracy, as he makes his speakers use their own tongue. Spinosa ignorantly asserts, that all the seven first chapters are in Chaldean and taken from the records of that nation by Judas Maccabeus. How then did Matthathias become acquainted with the contents?'
      v:005:
        - 'DAG:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Put.</i> Chaldean, "torn to pieces, and your house become infamous places;" (Calmet) Protestant, "a dunghill" (Haydock) --- Such cruel punishments were not uncommon. (1 Esdras vi. 11.) (Calmet) --- Bessus was torn in pieces by the relations of Darius; (Diod. xvii.) and the Persians generally cut off some member of criminals. (Brisson ii.)'
      v:008:
        - "DAG:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Gain.</i> Literally, \"redeem\" (Haydock) --- St. Paul uses a similar expression, exhorting us to save our souls even at the expense of our temporal interest. (Calmet) --- The diviners wished to give the king's fury time to abate, (Haydock) and to save their lives; (Calmet) or delay punishment, at least, as much as possible. (Haydock)"
      v:009:
        - 'DAG:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Thereof.</i> It is indeed more easy to discover what dream a person has had, than to explain it; since the devil might disclose the former, but he can only guess at what will happen, and herein his agents are often deceived. (See Genesis xl.) (Worthington) --- It is not even certain that the devil can know the dreams which we have not divulged, as it is the privilege of God to discern the secrets of the heart. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'DAG:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Men.</i> They acknowledged greater and less gods. (Stanley, p. 13. Chap. i.) --- They pretend not to have any communication with the superior ones, (Calmet) and by their answer unguardedly bear testimony to the excellence of the God whom Daniel served. (St. Jerome)'
      v:013:
        - 'DAG:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Slain.</i> Literally, "were slaughtering;" <i>interficiebantur.</i> (Haydock) --- Many think that some had already suffered. (Geier.; Menochius) --- They had been perhaps jealous of Daniel, and had not informed him of the matter. (St. Jerome)'
      v:014:
        - "DAG:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>General.</i> He occupied the same office as Putiphar, in Egypt. (Genesis xxxix. 1.) It was no disgrace for such a one to execute himself the king's order, as Banaias slew the brother of Solomon. (3 Kings ii.)"
      v:015:
        - 'DAG:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Cruel.</i> Chaldean also, "precipitate." (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'DAG:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Declare</i> the dream. (Haydock) --- The Chaldeans had promised only to explain it, and the king knew the superior merit of Daniel. (Chap. i. 19.) (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - 'DAG:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Secret.</i> Literally, "sacrament." Greek, "mystery," which seems to be derived from (Calmet) <i>mosthor,</i> "a secret." (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - 'DAG:2:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Night,</i> while he was probably asleep, (Calmet) or praying with his companions. (Villet.)'
      v:020:
        - 'DAG:2:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>His.</i> He grants them to whom he pleases, and disposes of kingdoms (Calmet) without control. (ver. 21.)'
      v:027:
        - 'DAG:2:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Soothsayers.</i> Chaldean <i>Gazerin,</i> (Haydock) who inspect entrails, (Ezechiel xxi. 21. St. Jerome) or tell fortunes by sticks. (Chap. iii. 3.)'
      v:028:
        - 'DAG:2:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Times.</i> In the Old Testament, this commonly signifies when Christ shall appear; but in the New, it refers to the end of the world. (Calmet)'
      v:029:
        - 'DAG:2:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Begin.</i> By thus telling what thoughts the king had entertained before his dream, he would be heard with greater confidence. (Worthington)'
      v:031:
        - 'DAG:2:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Terrible,</i> or unusual. (Calmet) --- The statue denoted the four great empires of the Chaldeans, Persians, Greeks and Romans. The metals did not mean that the empire of <i>gold</i> was greater than the rest, as that signified by the <i>iron</i> was far more powerful; but only that the empire of the Chaldeans was then the greatest, and that the Persians would acquire still more power and be surpassed by the Greeks, as they were by the Romans, till the kingdom of Christ should be spread over all the earth. (Worthington)'
      v:037:
        - 'DAG:2:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Of kings.</i> This title was used by the Persians. Nabuchodonosor was at that time the most potent monarch on earth. He conquered many nations, and greatly embellished the city of Babylon, surrounding it with three walls in fifteen days, and building hanging gardens, which were the wonder of the world. See Eusebius, præp. ix. 41. and x. 42. &c. (Calmet)'
      v:039:
        - 'DAG:2:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Another kingdom;</i> viz. that of the Medes and Persians. (Challoner) --- <i>Inferior;</i> later, of less duration and extent. (Calmet) --- <i>Third,</i> &c. That of Alexander the Great. (Challoner) --- <i>World.</i> Alexander received ambassadors at Babylon, from the most distant nations, testifying their submission. He conquered beyond the river Indus, &c. (Diod. A. 1. Olym. 14.[year 1 of the 14th Olympiad.?]) (Calmet)'
      v:040:
        - "DAG:2:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>The fourth kingdom,</i> &c. Some understand this of the successors of Alexander, the kings of Syria and Egypt: others, of the Roman empire and its civil wars. (Challoner) --- The former supposition seems best, though the latter is almost universally received, and will be explained hereafter. (Calmet) --- The Roman empire did not immediately rise out of Alexander's, and had no relation to the Jews, &c. (Grotius, L'Empereus.) --- But it surely swallowed up all that he had left to his generals, and proved the greatest scourge to the Jewish nation; which has been ever since scattered, while the kingdom of Christ gains ground, and will flourish till that of Rome shall be no more. Antichrist will then appear to cast a cloud over, but not destroy it for three years and a half. It is the opinion of many Fathers, &c. that the Roman empire will subsist till that event take place; (see 2 Thessalonians ii. 3, 7.) and thus it may be said, that the fourth empire shall not be given <i>to another people.</i> For antichrist will not strive to exalt a particular nation, but to rule over all. Yet his dominion will be short, and will end in the general dissolution of nature; so that the Roman empire may be deemed to last for a long time, or even <i>for ever.</i> (ver. 44.) Those who adopt the former system, allow (Haydock) that the <i>stone</i> designates both the Roman empire and that of Christ; so that some parts of the prediction may refer to one and some to the other. The origin and progress of the Roman empire, might be a figure of the spiritual power of the Church. It is certain that the successors of Alexander owed their dominion to their valour, and established it by the slaughter of many great generals. The kings who followed Seleucus and Ptolemy were remarkable for a mixture of good and bad qualities. Their efforts to preserve their power by intermarriages, proved abortive. The prophet seems also to have had them in view, chap. vii. 7., and viii. 22. (Calmet)"
      v:041:
        - 'DAG:2:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Clay.</i> The iron was in a rude state, mixed with earth. The Roman power was at last partly exercised by consuls and partly by emperors. (Menochius) --- Florus (1.) compares it to the four states of a man, infancy, childhood, youth, and old age. Its youth may be dated from the conquest of all Italy to Tiberius; afterwards it fell to decay, while the eternal kingdom of Christ was forming, ver. 44.'
      v:043:
        - "DAG:2:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Man.</i> Pompey and Cæsar, Anthony and Augustus, married each other's relations; but they soon quarrelled, and the race of the Cæsars was extinct in Nero. But this is better understood of the kings of Syria and of Egypt. (Calmet)"
      v:044:
        - "DAG:2:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>Kingdom</i> of Christ, in the Catholic Church, which cannot be destroyed. (Challoner) --- This alone cannot be destroyed. (Worthington) --- All other empires change. The Catholic Church has stood for seventeen centuries in the midst of persecutions, which gives us an assurance that she will continue for ever. (Calmet) --- \"Then,\" says Munster, \"was the kingdom of Christ set up, not by arms,...but by the divine power.\" This interpretation arises from the improper version, <i>without hands;</i> whereas the sequel shews that the empire here spoken of, is attended with the like violence as the four others, which it destroys. The Roman empire was in no degree connected with others by marriage. In the following verse, Munster improperly turns to the second coming of our Saviour. Grotius here asserts that the stone alludes to the Roman armies, prefiguring the Son of man, whose gospel is indicated by the progress of the Roman empire, as both sprung from small beginnings. But who informed him that there were such figures in that empire as in the Old Testament? All empires begin in that manner, and types should have some greater resemblance with the reality. The Church meddles not with the temporal powers. It is therefore plain that the prophet speaks of empires which shall succeed each other. (Houbigant. perf. Prop. 340.) --- <i>Kingdoms.</i> That of Rome comprised all the former. The persecuting emperors are forced to yield, and the colossal power of infidelity and vice falls before the gospel. Christ's dominion is spiritual, exercised against wickedness; (Calmet) is heavenly and eternal. (Haydock) --- The blood of martyrs was more efficacious in the establishing of Christianity, than fire and sword had been in forming other empires. (Menochius)"
      v:045:
        - 'DAG:2:45 | 45 | 45 | <i>Hands.</i> Protestant marg.: "mountain, which was not in hand." (Haydock) --- Christ was born of a virgin; and his kingdom was not established by ambition, like others. Yet it presently became a mountain, and filled the earth. (St. Justin, dial.; St. Augustine, tr. 9. in Jo.) --- <i>God</i> himself sets up this <i>kingdom.</i> (Calmet)'
      v:046:
        - 'DAG:2:46 | 46 | 46 | <i>Daniel,</i> taking him for a little god, under the great one, ver. 17. (Worthington) --- <i>Victims.</i> Chaldean <i>mincha,</i> (Haydock) of flour, &c. But the prophet had already declared his sentiments on this head, (ver. 28.) and abhorred such honours, like St. Paul, (Acts xiv. 10.; Calmet) though this is not here recorded. (Menochius)'
      v:047:
        - 'DAG:2:47 | 47 | 47 | <i>Of gods,</i> above all those of the country for explaining hidden things: yet he did not acknowledge him to be the only true God. (Calmet) --- He afterwards erected an idol to represent his own greatness. (Worthington)'
      v:048:
        - 'DAG:2:48 | 48 | 48 | <i>Provinces,</i> or that of Babylonia, which was the first. --- <i>Wise men.</i> This would not engage him in any idolatrous practices.'
      v:049:
        - 'DAG:2:49 | 49 | 49 | <i>Works</i> of agriculture, (Calmet) which the ancient kings of Persia encouraged with great attention, appointing officers to reward or punish according as their land was cultivated. (Xenophon, Cyr. 8. & Œcon.) --- St. Jerome thinks they were appointed judges, (Calmet) or assistants of Daniel. (Grotius) --- <i>Palace.</i> Literally, "gates," (Haydock) as receiver of the taxes, particularly at Susa. (Chap. viii. 2.) (Marsham Egypt. sæc. 18.)'

Tell me, therefore, the dream, that I may know that you also give a true interpretation thereof.'
      v:010: 'DAG:2:10 | 10 | 10 | Then the Chaldeans answered before the king, and said: There is no man upon earth, that can accomplish thy word, O king; neither doth any king, though great and mighty, ask such a thing of any diviner, or wise man, or Chaldean.'
      v:011: 'DAG:2:11 | 11 | 11 | For the thing that thou askest, O king, is difficult: nor can any one be found that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose conversation is not with men.'
      v:012: 'DAG:2:12 | 12 | 12 | Upon hearing this, the king in fury, and in great wrath, commanded that all the wise men of Babylon should be put to death.'

      v:024: 'DAG:2:24 | 24 | 24 | After this Daniel went in to Arioch, to whom the king had given orders to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and he spoke thus to him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will tell the solution to the king.'
      v:025: 'DAG:2:25 | 25 | 25 | Then Arioch in haste brought in Daniel to the king, and said to him: I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Juda, that will resolve the question to the king.'
      v:026: 'DAG:2:26 | 26 | 26 | The king answered, and said to Daniel, whose name was Baltassar: Thinkest thou indeed that thou canst tell me the dream that I saw, and the interpretation thereof?'
      v:027: 'DAG:2:27 | 27 | 27 | And Daniel made answer before the king, and said: The secret that the king desireth to know, none of the wise men, or the philosophers, or the diviners, or the soothsayers, can declare to the king.'
      v:028: 'DAG:2:28 | 28 | 28 | But there is a God in heaven that revealeth mysteries, who hath shewn to thee, O king Nabuchodonosor, what is to come to pass in the latter times. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these:'

      v:030: 'DAG:2:30 | 30 | 30 | To me also this secret is revealed, not by any wisdom that I have more than all men alive: but that the interpretation might be made manifest to the king, and thou mightest know the thoughts of thy mind.'

Some take it for Nabolpolassar, (Calmet) or for the king himself. (St. Jerome) (Worthington) --- But he never complains of the injury shewn to his own person, and therefore it probably was meant for Bel, the chief god, chap. iv. 5., and xiv. 1. This nation adored statues, Baruch vi. 3. The Persians worshipped only the elements. (Calmet) --- Ochus first set up the statue of the goddess Tanais or Anais. (Clem. Protr.) --- <i>Dura.</i> Septuagint, \"enclosed.\" (St. Jerome) --- This happened towards the end of the king's reign, (ver. 98, &c.) of course the three young men might be about fifty years old.

(Calmet) --- <i>Governors.</i> Literally, \"the grandees who were in power;\" (Haydock) counsellors. The original adds, (Calmet) <i>Thopthia,</i> (Haydock) \"lawyers\" and orators. The head of the Turkish religion is called <i>muphti,</i> from the same root, (Calmet) <i>peti,</i> \"to teach.\" (Haydock)"

But as it was in all the Greek Bibles, (which were originally translated from the Hebrew) it is more than probable that it had been formerly in the Hebrew; or rather in the Chaldaic, in which the Book of Daniel was written. But this is certain: that it is and has been of old, received by the Church, and read as canonical Scripture in her liturgy and divine offices. (Challoner) --- See the preface. (Worthington)'

But they had done so already, (ver. 26) and make this confession, (Haydock) as Daniel does, chap. ix.; reflecting, that if the nation had not transgressed, they would not thus have been exposed to the fury of the king.

Yet the republic was in disorder. (Calmet) --- Sedecias was dead, Joakim in prison, so that no Jewish king ruled over the people; nor was there any prophet in the promised land, Jeremias being either dead or in Egypt.

      v:013: 'DAG:3:13 | 13 | 13 | Then Nabuchodonosor in fury, and in wrath, commanded that Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago should be brought: who immediately were brought before the king.'
      v:014: 'DAG:3:14 | 14 | 14 | And Nabuchodonosor, the king, spoke to them, and said: Is it true, O Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, that you do not worship my gods, nor adore the golden statue that I have set up?'
      v:015: 'DAG:3:15 | 15 | 15 | Now, therefore, if you be ready, at what hour soever, you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, flute, harp, sackbut, and psaltery, and symphony, and of all kind of music, prostrate yourselves, and adore the statue which I have made: but if you do not adore, you shall be cast the same hour into the furnace of burning fire: and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hand?'
      v:016: 'DAG:3:16 | 16 | 16 | Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, answered, and said to king Nabuchodonosor: We have no occasion to answer thee concerning this matter.'

      v:020: 'DAG:3:20 | 20 | 20 | And he commanded the strongest men that were in his army, to bind the feet of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the furnace of burning fire.'

      v:095: "DAG:3:95 | 95 | 95 | Then Nabuchodonosor breaking forth, said: Blessed be the God of them, to wit, of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that believed in him: and they changed the king's word, and delivered up their bodies, that they might not serve nor adore any god, except their own God."

(Challoner) --- <i>Gods.</i> He speaks conformably to his false opinion; (St. Jerome) or, being instructed by Daniel, he testifies that the Holy Spirit enlightens the prophet. (Theod.) Greek has "god," which St. Jerome disapproves; though the plural is often used for the true God. Reason evinces that only the Deity can disclose the secrets of futurity, Genesis xli. 38. (Calmet)'

      v:013:
        - "DAG:4:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Changed,</i> &c. It does not appear, by Scripture, that Nabuchodonosor was changed from human shape, much less that he was changed into an ox, but only that he lost his reason, and became mad; and in this condition remained abroad in the company of beasts, eating grass like an ox, till his hair grew in such a manner as to resemble the feathers of eagles, and his nails to be like birds' claws. (Challoner) --- Origen represents the whole as an allegorical description of the fall of Lucifer. See St. Jerome. But his arguments have made little impression: and it is universally believed that Nabuchodonosor was thus punished for his pride, after a whole year had been allowed him to see if he would repent. The manner of this strange metamorphose has been variously explained. But it seems that he was seized with the species of madness styled Lycanthropy, (Calmet) as Virgil (Ec. vi. 48.) relates of the daughters of Prœtus, who \"with mimick'd mooings fill'd the fields.\" (Haydock) --- Thus many fancy they are kings, or horses, (Calmet) and that they are continually mounting above the clouds, of which we have an instance in a woman still living at Whitby, who in other respects appears to be sufficiently sensible, (Haydock) as Tertullian and others think Nabuchodonosor was, that he might suffer more. Yet it is commonly supposed he lost his senses for a while, till God was pleased to restore them at the time appointed; when his former humiliating state might make a deep impression upon his mind, as well as upon his subjects, and caution all future generations to guard against the fatal consequences of pride. His son, Evilmerodac, probably ruled during his absence. Most of the Chaldean writings have perished; so that we need not be surprised if they take no notice of this event, which was so disgraceful to the nation. Yet Megasthenes, (in Eusebius præp. ix. ult.) seems to hint at it, when he represents the king seized with a divine fury, and crying out: (Calmet Diss.) \"I, the same Nabuchodonosor, foretell unto you, Babylonians, a fatal calamity, which neither my ancestor Belus, nor even the kingdom of Bel, (Haydock, <i>the gods</i>) have power to avert. For a Persian mule (<i>Cyrus</i>; Calmet) shall come, assisted by your demons, and bring on slavery....Having uttered this oracle, he suddenly disappeared.\" (Haydock) --- <i>Beast's heart.</i> In his hypochondriac temper he imagined himself (Calmet) to be an ox, (Haydock) avoided the society of men, going naked and feeding on grass, upon his hands and feet, till (after seven years) God restored him to his senses and kingdom. (Worthington) --- The food which he used would tend to purge him, and naturally abate the disorder. (Barthol.) --- Yet none but God could tell precisely when the madness would seize or leave him. --- <i>Times.</i> This usually denotes years, in Daniel; (vii. 25. and xii. 7.) and of course (Calmet) we must understand it here in this sense; (Worthington) though some have explained it of an indeterminate length of time, or of weeks, months, or seasons. Only winter and summer were admitted, so that half this period would thus suffice. See Theod. (Calmet)"

      v:016:
        - "DAG:4:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Hour.</i> Chaldean <i>shaha,</i> (Haydock) implies \"a little while;\" (Grotius) yet of some duration, not precisely like one of the modern hours. The prophet was silent, being troubled by the divine spirit, (Chap. x. 8.) at the view of impending misery; or unwilling to hurt the king's feelings, till he should urge him to speak. (Calmet) --- He was sorry to denounce such calamities, yet must speak the truth. (Worthington) --- <i>Trouble.</i> Theodotion, \"make thee hurry.\" He perceived the prophet's anxiety, and encouraged him."

(Worthington) --- Yet this is very doubtful, ver. 31.'

(Calmet) or 122.; Worthington) seems to think that he was saved; and the author [St. Augustine?] of the Book on Pred. & grace, (chap. 15) attributes to him, remarks that his repentance was different from that of Pharao. Hence none must despair. (St. Jerome, ep. vii. to Læta.) --- See Theod.; Cornelius a Lapide, &c., who maintain that same opinion: but St. Thomas Aquinas expresses his doubts. Isaias (xiv. 9.) seems to consign him to <i>hell;</i> and the king here manifests his adhesion to <i>Bel,</i> (ver. 5.) and great inconstancy, chap. ii. 47., and iii. 15. His conviction seems therefore to have been only in speculation, (Calmet) or momentary, like that of the philosophers, (Romans i.) which would render them only more criminal; and we must confess, (Haydock) that this conversion is very equivocal. (Sanctius, ver. 24 and 34.) (Haydock)'

(Challoner) (Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 10.) --- This is the last act of his which is recorded. If he had lived much longer, he would probably have restored the Jews. (Worthington) --- But the time decreed by heaven for their liberation was not yet arrived. (Haydock)'

      v:007: 'DAG:4:7 | 7 | 7 | This was the vision of my head in my bed: I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was exceeding great.'
      v:008: 'DAG:4:8 | 8 | 8 | The tree was great and strong: and the height thereof reached unto heaven: the sight thereof was even to the ends of all the earth.'
      v:009: 'DAG:4:9 | 9 | 9 | Its leaves were most beautiful, and its fruit exceeding much: and in it was food for all: under it dwelt cattle, and beasts, and in the branches thereof the fowls of the air had their abode: and all flesh did eat of it.'
      v:010: 'DAG:4:10 | 10 | 10 | I saw in the vision of my head upon my bed, and behold a watcher, and a holy one came down from heaven.'
      v:011: 'DAG:4:11 | 11 | 11 | He cried aloud, and said thus: Cut down the tree, and chop off the branches thereof: shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruits: let the beasts fly away that are under it, and the birds from its branches.'
      v:012: 'DAG:4:12 | 12 | 12 | Nevertheless, leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and let it be tied with a band of iron and of brass, among the grass, that is without, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let its portion be with the wild beasts in the grass of the earth.'
      v:013: "DAG:4:13 | 13 | 13 | Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given him: and let seven times pass over him."

      v:015: 'DAG:4:15 | 15 | 15 | I, king Nabuchodonosor, saw this dream: thou, therefore, O Baltassar, tell me quickly the interpretation: for all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to declare the meaning of it to me: but thou art able, because the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.'
      v:016: 'DAG:4:16 | 16 | 16 | Then Daniel, whose name was Baltassar, began silently to think within himself for about one hour: and his thoughts troubled him. But the king answering, said: Baltassar, let not the dream and the interpretation thereof trouble thee. Baltassar answered, and said: My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thy enemies.'
      v:017: 'DAG:4:17 | 17 | 17 | The tree which thou sawest, which was high and strong, whose height reached to the skies, and the sight thereof into all the earth:'
      v:018: 'DAG:4:18 | 18 | 18 | And the branches thereof were most beautiful, and its fruit exceeding much, and in it was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and the birds of the air had their abode in its branches.'

      v:023: 'DAG:4:23 | 23 | 23 | But whereas he commanded, that the stump of the roots thereof, that is, of the tree, should be left: thy kingdom shall remain to thee, after thou shalt have known that power is from heaven.'

      v:025: DAG:4:25 | 25 | 25 | All these things came upon king Nabuchodonosor.
      v:026: DAG:4:26 | 26 | 26 | At the end of twelve months he was walking in the palace of Babylon.

      v:028: "DAG:4:28 | 28 | 28 | And while the word was yet in the king's mouth, a voice came down from heaven: To thee, O king Nabuchodonosor, it is said: Thy kingdom shall pass from thee."
      v:029: 'DAG:4:29 | 29 | 29 | And they shall cast thee out from among men, and thy dwelling shall be with cattle and wild beasts: thou shalt eat grass like an ox, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.'
      v:030: "DAG:4:30 | 30 | 30 | The same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nabuchodonosor, and he was driven away from among men, and did eat grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven: till his hairs grew like the feathers of eagles, and his nails like birds' claws."
      v:031: 'DAG:4:31 | 31 | 31 | Now at the end of the days, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}I, Nabuchodonosor, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my sense was restored to me: and I blessed the most High, and I praised and glorified him that liveth for ever: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 1}for his power is an everlasting power, and his kingdom is to all generations.'
      v:032: 'DAG:4:32 | 32 | 32 | And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing before him: for he doth according to his will, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}as well with the powers of heaven, as among the inhabitants of the earth: and there is none that can resist his hand, and say to him: Why hast thou done it?'
      v:033: 'DAG:4:33 | 33 | 33 | At the same time my sense returned to me, and I came to the honour and glory of my kingdom: and my shape returned to me: and my nobles, and my magistrates, sought for me, and I was restored to my kingdom: and greater majesty was added to me.'
      v:034: 'DAG:4:34 | 34 | 34 | Therefore I, Nabuchodonosor, do now praise, and magnify, and glorify the King of heaven: because all his works are true, and his ways judgments, and them that walk in pride he is able to abase.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'DAG:5:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Baltassar.</i> He is believed to be the same as Nabonides, the last of the Chaldean kings, grandson to Nabuchodonosor. He is called his son (ver. 2, 11, &c.) according to the style of the Scriptures, because he was a descendant from him. (Challoner; St. Jerome in Isaiah xiii.; Usher, &c.) --- Some think that he was brother of Evilmerodac, ver. 11., and Baruch i. 11. But he seems rather to have been his son, Jeremias xxvii. 7. Profane authors place Neriglissor and Laborosoarchod between them. They were not of the royal family, and might be looked upon as usurpers, or reigned in some other place; or they did not meddle with the Jews. (Calmet) --- It is wonderful that Josephus should prefer these authors; (Tirinus) yet he abandons the dates given by them. (Jewish Antiquities x. 12. & contra Apion 1.) They represent Nabonides as a simple Babylonian raised to the throne, defeated by Cyrus, and suffered to retire into Carmania; whereas, Baltassar was slain, ver. 29. (Calmet) --- The others were of a different lineage, and are mentioned by Eusebius, &c. Evilmerodac certainly preceded him on the throne, and honoured Joachin in the 37th year of his captivity. (Worthington) --- <i>Thousand;</i> or, "for his officers over a thousand men." (Theodotion) --- <i>Every.</i> Chaldean, "and drank wine before the thousand," more than any, for this was deemed a great perfection; or he drank in their presence, but apart. (Calmet) --- The Persian monarchs used to sit in a separate apartment, with a veil before the door, so that they could see the guests without being seen. A great chandelier was before them; (Athen. iv. 10.) probably on the outside, otherwise it would have defeated their purpose. Light sufficient would appear for Baltassar to see the hand-writing on his chamber wall, ver. 5. (Haydock) --- According to the order of time, this chapter should be placed after the vii. and viii. (Calmet) --- But those contain visions. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - 'DAG:5:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Loosed,</i> so that he quaked for fear, Ezechiel xxix. 7. (Calmet) --- He was not so drunk as to be deprived of sense. (Haydock) --- This happened in the 17th and last year of his reign, when Daniel was about a hundred years old, (Worthington) though we have no certain account of his age. (Haydock) --- He might be eighty-two when he died. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'DAG:5:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Purple.</i> This and the <i>chain</i> were reserved for the highest nobility. --- <i>Third,</i> or one of the three great officers, chap. vi. 1., and 2 Kings xxiii. 8, 19.'
      v:008:
        - 'DAG:5:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Read.</i> It was written in Samaritan characters; or, for want of vowels, could not be read or understood. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - 'DAG:5:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>The queen.</i> Not the wife, but the mother of the king; (Challoner) Amyit, widow of Nabuchodonosor, and sister of Darius, the Mede; or (Calmet) Nitocris, the mother of Labynithus, (Herod. i.) whom many confound with Baltassar. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'DAG:5:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Father.</i> So a grandfather might be styled, Jeremias xxvii. 7.(Worthington) ---Daniel was not perhaps at the head of the wise men. (Calmet) --- They were too jealous to mention him; and the intoxicated king and courtiers remembered not his merit, till an aged matron suggested that he should be consulted. He was probably (Haydock) in some office, at Susa, yet happened to be then in Babylon, (Calmet) which was besieged; and thither he might have retired at the approached of Cyrus.'
      v:016:
        - 'DAG:5:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Difficult.</i> Literally, "things which are tied," or perplexing. (Haydock) --- The Persians still use the like expressions, to imply an intelligent governor. (Chardin.)'
      v:017:
        - 'DAG:5:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Another.</i> He does not refuse the offers, but civilly replies that he will give satisfaction without regard to any recompense.'
      v:019:
        - 'DAG:5:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Slew.</i> He was an absolute monarch, and considered his subjects as so many slaves. (Calmet) --- Xerxes having called together his nobles, that he might not seem to have resolved on the war with Greece alone, said: "Nevertheless, remember that you have to obey rather than to advise." (V. Max. 9. 5. 2.)'
      v:021:
        - 'DAG:5:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Beasts.</i> His disordered imagination made him dwell with them. (Worthington) --- It is strange that such an example should have been so soon forgotten, that Daniel is forced to repeat it so explicitly, chap. iv. 13.'
      v:023:
        - 'DAG:5:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Vessels.</i> Only part had been returned to Sedecias: (Chap. i. 2.) but they were taken again, and kept in the palace, or in the temple of Bel. (Haydock) --- <i>Breath,</i> or soul, Genesis ii. 7. (Calmet)'
      v:025:
        - "DAG:5:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Phares.</i> These words consist of three letters, <i>mona, thokol, pros,</i> as we add <i>o</i> merely for pronunciation. Being unconnected and almost destitute of vowels, (Haydock) it is not easy even for the learned to read these words, or to ascertain their meaning. Thus <i>d b r</i> being placed in a similar situation, it would be impossible to determine the sense; as it may have ten different meanings, according as it is pronounced, ver. 8.  (Calmet) --- <i>Mane</i> is twice repeated, to shew the certainty and exactitude of the numbering. (Menochius) --- Yet in the sequel each word occurs once and unconnected, as it is here in the Vulgate; not <i>Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin,</i> (Protestants; Haydock) \"He hath numbered, numbered, weighed, and the dividers <i>or</i> the Persians\" are upon thee, (T.[Tirinus?]) as Dalila said to Samson. Only three words (Haydock) were written. (St. Jerome) --- The rest contain the prophet's explanation. The Chaldean empire had now attained its utmost height. Its king brought ruin upon himself by his wicked life. (Haydock) --- He would soon be divided with the sword, and his kingdom shared between the Medes and Persians. (St. Jerome)"
      v:028:
        - "DAG:5:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Persians.</i> Those who confound Baltassar with Nabonides, say that Cyrus made himself master of all the empire. How then was it divided? Darius rather took possession of the greatest part while Cyrus had Persia, (Calmet) till his uncle's death. (Haydock)"
      v:029:
        - "DAG:5:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Third,</i> or over a third part. (St. Jerome; ver. 7.; Haydock) The honours were conferred without delay, and they would have been made public in the morning. But death prevented the king; and Daniel did not enjoy them till they were ratified by Darius, to whom he adhered. (Calmet) --- The Medes then besieged the city, which they took that night, when most part were drunk. (Worthington) --- It was a solemn festival, Isaiah xxi. (St. Jerome) --- Cyrus rushed in by the channel of the Euphrates, and two of the king's guards slew him to revenge themselves. (Xenoph. 7.; Beros.)"
      v:031:
        - "DAG:5:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Darius.</i> He is called <i>Cyaxares</i> by the historians, and was the son of Astyages, and uncle to Cyrus (Challoner) as well as to Baltassar, by the mother's side. He is styled Astyages, (Chap. xiii. 65.) or Artaxerxes. (Septuagint, chap. vi. 1.) He takes the title of king both of the Medes and Persians, chap. vi. 8., &c. (Calmet)"

      v:011: 'DAG:5:11 | 11 | 11 | There is a man in thy kingdom that hath the spirit of the holy gods in him: and in the days of thy father knowledge and wisdom were found in him: for king Nabuchodonosor, thy father, appointed him prince of the wise men, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers, thy father, I say, O king:'
      v:012: 'DAG:5:12 | 12 | 12 | Because a greater spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, and interpretation of dreams, and shewing of secrets, and resolving of difficult things, were found in him, that is, in Daniel: whom the king named Baltarssar. Now, therefore, let Daniel be called for, and he will tell the interpretation.'
      v:013: 'DAG:5:13 | 13 | 13 | Then Daniel was brought in before the king. And the king spoke, and said to him: Art thou Daniel of the children of the captivity of Juda, whom my father, the king, brought out of Judea?'

But if this did not take place at Babylon, it would be rather at Susa, chap. viii. Josephus counts 300 or 360 governments, though when the monarchy was increased there were only 127, Esther i. (Calmet) --- He may therefore speak here of large towns, which had each a magistrate. Such regulations easily vary. (Haydock) --- Darius acts as master of the whole empire.'

        - 'DAG:6:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Kingdom,</i> as prime minister, to whom the three princes should be accountable, as the inferior governors were to them. (Haydock) ---The king was now advanced in years, and wished to ease himself of part of the burden, (Calmet) as he could entirely confide in Daniel. (Haydock) --- He reigned only one year, chap. xiii. 65. (Worthington) --- <i>King.</i> Chaldean, "kingdom," (Haydock) to accuse him of treason, (Grotius) or to get him removed. (Calmet) --- This is an old and malignant trick, to call religion treason, and to get laws made for that purpose. (Worthington) --- <i>In him</i> a great proof of integrity! (Menochius)'
      v:006:
        - 'DAG:6:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Craftily.</i> Chaldean, "came tumultuously to," &c. (Calmet) --- They hoped thus to convince the king, as they were so unanimous. He would not perceive the drift of their petition, adn was flattered with the idea of being like a god. Daniel was not consulted, though on other occasions the king reposed such confidence in him, as the deputies so impudently asserted that the wish was universal! So easily are princes deceived!

      v:009:
        - 'DAG:6:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>It.</i> Nabuchodonosor of Babylon, and of Ninive, had both pretended to be gods; (Chap. iii. 15; Judith v. 29.) (Calmet) and Curtius (8.) remarks, "that the Persians follow the dictates of prudence as well as of piety, in worshipping their kings among the gods, the majesty of empire being its best protection." (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - 'DAG:6:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Before.</i> He did not open the windows that he might be seen, as that would have been rashness; nor did many perceive what he was doing, (ver. 11.; Worthington) as it was in an <i>upper room,</i> but only those who rushed in. (Haydock) --- It was the usual practice of the Jews, (Calmet) to pray turning towards the temple, as Solomon had directed, (3 Kings viii. 48; St. Jerome in Ezechiel viii. 16.) though it was now in ashes. (Haydock) --- Daniel observed the third, sixth, and ninth hours, as the Church still does, Acts ii. 15., and x. 9. (St. Jerome)'

(Worthington) --- These wretches deserved to perish, though they had spoken nothing but the truth. (Haydock) --- <i>Wives.</i> Many examples of such punishments occur, (Calmet) as it was presumed the children and wives were infected by the bad example, and would imitiate it, (Junius) if they had not concurred already. (Menochius) --- This must have been the case, to make it just. (Haydock) See Joshua vii. --- <i>Abominandœ leges,</i> says Ammianus, (23) speaking of the customs of Persia, <i>per quas ob noxam unius omnis propinquitas perit.</i> (Calmet)'

      v:003: 'DAG:6:3 | 3 | 3 | And Daniel excelled all the princes, and governors: because a greater spirit of God was in him.'
      v:004: 'DAG:6:4 | 4 | 4 | And the king thought to set him over all the kingdom; whereupon the princes, and the governors, sought to find occasion against Daniel, with regard to the king: and they could find no cause, nor suspicion, because he was faithful, and no fault, nor suspicion was found in him'
      v:005: 'DAG:6:5 | 5 | 5 | Then these men said: We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, unless perhaps concerning the law of his God.'
      v:006: 'DAG:6:6 | 6 | 6 | Then the princes, and the governors, craftily suggested to the king, and spoke thus unto him: King Darius, live for ever:'
      v:007: 'DAG:6:7 | 7 | 7 | All the princes of the kingdom, the magistrates, and governors, the senators, and judges, have consulted together, that an imperial decree, and an edict be published: That whosoever shall ask any petition of any god, or man, for thirty days, but of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.'
      v:008: 'DAG:6:8 | 8 | 8 | Now, therefore, O king, confirm the sentence, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}and sign the decree: that what is decreed by the Medes and Persians may not be altered, nor any man be allowed to transgress it.'
      v:009: 'DAG:6:9 | 9 | 9 | So king Darius set forth the decree, and established it.'
      v:010: 'DAG:6:10 | 10 | 10 | Now, when Daniel knew this, that is to say, that the law was made, he went into his house: and opening the windows in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem, he knelt down three times a day, and adored, and gave thanks before his God, as he had been accustomed to do before.'
      v:011: 'DAG:6:11 | 11 | 11 | Wherefore those men carefully watching him, found Daniel praying and making supplication to his God.'
      v:012: 'DAG:6:12 | 12 | 12 | And they came and spoke to the king concerning the edict: O king, hast thou not decreed, that every man that should make a request to any of the gods, or men, for thirty days, but to thyself, O king, should be cast into the den of the lions? And the king answered them, saying: The word is true, according to the decree of the Medes and Persians, which it is not lawful to violate.'
      v:013: 'DAG:6:13 | 13 | 13 | Then they answered, and said before the king: Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Juda, hath not regarded thy law, nor the decree that thou hast made: but three times a day he maketh his prayer.'
      v:014: 'DAG:6:14 | 14 | 14 | Now when the king had heard these words, he was very much grieved, and in behalf of Daniel he set his heart to deliver him, and even till sun-set he laboured to save him.'
      v:015: "DAG:6:15 | 15 | 15 | But those men perceiving the king's design, said to him: Know thou, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no decree which the king hath made, may be altered."
      v:016: 'DAG:6:16 | 16 | 16 | Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of the lions. And the king said to Daniel: Thy God, whom thou always servest, he will deliver thee.'
      v:017: 'DAG:6:17 | 17 | 17 | And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den: which the king sealed with his own ring, and with the ring of his nobles, that nothing should be done against Daniel.'
      v:018: 'DAG:6:18 | 18 | 18 | And the king went away to his house, and laid himself down without taking supper, and meat was not set before him, and even sleep departed from him.'

      v:021: 'DAG:6:21 | 21 | 21 | And Daniel answering the king, said: O king, live for ever:'

      v:023: 'DAG:6:23 | 23 | 23 | Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and he commanded that Daniel should be taken out of the den: and Daniel was taken out of the den, and no hurt was found in him, because he believed in his God.'
      v:024: "DAG:6:24 | 24 | 24 | And by the king's commandment, those men were brought that had accused Daniel: and they were cast into the lions' den, they and their children, and their wives: and they did not reach the bottom of the den, before the lions caught them, and broke all their bones in pieces."
      v:025: 'DAG:6:25 | 25 | 25 | Then king Darius wrote to all people, tribes, and languages, dwelling in the whole earth: <b>Peace</b> be multiplied unto you.'

But some rather choose to understand the fourth beast of the successors of Alexander the great, more especially of them that reigned in Asia and Syria, (Challoner) or in Egypt, chap. ii. 40.(Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - 'DAG:7:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Man.</i> The emperors of Babylon were forced to confess that they were nothing more. (Calmet) --- Their cruel and rapid conquests (Worthington) are denoted by this monstrous animal. Its wings shew how the lands were divided between the Medes and Persians. Perhaps Neriglissor, &c., shared a part, chap. v. 1. (Calmet)'

(Calmet) --- <i>Rows.</i> Greek, "wings or sides" of an animal, (Haydock) or "bones." (Grotius) --- Cyrus was always at war; and Justin (1.) says, that Tomyris II of Scythia, ordered his head to be cut off, and thrown into a vessel full of blood. His troops are styled robbers, Jeremias li. 48. The ambition of Cambyses, Hystaspes, &c. are insatiable.'
      v:006:
        - 'DAG:7:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Leopard,</i> a small spotted beast, may denote the size and disposition of Alexander, as well as his rapid conquests. When he was asked how he had subdued so many, he answered, "by never putting off." (Calmet) --- <i>Four.</i> He led his forces on all sides; (Haydock) and after his death, his empire was divided into four, (Worthington) Egypt, Syria, Asia, and Macedon, (Theod.) as he had united in his person the empire of the Chaldeans, Medes, Persians, and Greeks. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'DAG:7:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Unlike.</i> It is not named: but shews the incomparable power of the Romans, governed by kings, consuls, tribunes, dictators, and emperors, at different times. (Worthington) --- This is the opinion generally received, which we shall explain. Yet many think that the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt are designated, as [in] chap. ii. 40. St. Jerome acknowledges that what is understood of antichrist, had been partly verified in Epiphanes, his figure. The beast was to be slain before the coming of the Son of man, ver. 11, 26. It would persecute for three years and a half; but God would grant victory to his saints, as he did to the Machabees. Yet they only exhibited a faint idea of what has been done by the Church. The same subject is treated, chap. xi. Many things caused the dominion of the successors of Alexander to be unlike that of others. It was never united, and was very destructive to the Jews. (Calmet) --- <i>Horns.</i> That is, ten kingdoms, (as [in] Apocalypse xvii. 12.) among which the empire of the fourth beast shall be parcelled: or ten kings of the number of the successors of Alexander, as figures of such as shall be about the time of antichrist. (Challoner) --- Epiphanes was the eighth king, and Laomedon, Antigonus, and Demetrius, had been governors of Syria before. Most understand this of antichrist, whom Epiphanes foreshewed. Others think that it points out Vespasian, the tenth successor of Cæsar, who made war on the Jews. The same prediction may regard different events, as the <i>abomination</i> (Chap. ix.) may allude to the profanations committed by Epiphanes, by the Romans at the last siege, and by antichrist. Others apply this to the Turkish empire, which may be paving the way for the great antagonist of Christ. (Calmet) Dioclesian and Julian may also be meant, as well as other forerunners of the <i>man of sin.</i> (Haydock) --- He shall overcome many, but his fury shall continue but a short time, ver. 25. (Worthington)'
      v:008:
        - "DAG:7:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Little horn.</i> This is commonly understood of antichrist. It may also be applied to that great persecutor, Antiochus Epiphanes, as a figure of antichrist. (Challoner) --- He was the youngest son of Antiochus the great, and was a hostage of Rome. While he was returning, his elder brother died, and Epiphanes excluded his son Philometor, of Egypt, and the usurper Heliodorus. He also defeated <i>three,</i> Philometor, on the <i>south;</i> Artaxias, king of Armenia, on the <i>east;</i> and <i>the strength,</i> or God's people, ver 24., and chap. viii. 9. --- <i>Man.</i> He gained several at first, by his affability. --- <i>Things:</i> blasphemy, 1 Machabees i. 23, 43.

      v:011:
        - 'DAG:7:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Spoke.</i> I wished to see how the king would be punished. He felt the hand of God as he was going to destroy all the Jews, when he pretended to repent, 1 Machabees vi., and 2 Machabees ix. 4. His successors could not much disturb the Jews, ver. 13. (Calmet)'

By his power antichrist is overthrown. (Worthington)'

(Challoner) (Apocalypse xi. 2. and xii. 14.) --- Josephus (Jewish Wars, preface) says the sacrifices were discontinued so long, or rather this time elapsed from the publishing his edict till the temple was purified.

      v:013: 'DAG:7:13 | 13 | 13 | I beheld, therefore, in the vision of the night, and lo, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and he came even to the ancient of days: and they presented him before him.'

      v:015: 'DAG:7:15 | 15 | 15 | My spirit trembled; I, Daniel, was affrighted at these things, and the visions of my head troubled me.'
      v:016: 'DAG:7:16 | 16 | 16 | I went near to one of them that stood by, and asked the truth of him concerning all these things, and he told me the interpretation of the words, and instructed me:'
      v:017: 'DAG:7:17 | 17 | 17 | These four great beasts, are four kingdoms, which shall arise out of the earth.'
      v:018: 'DAG:7:18 | 18 | 18 | But the saints of the most high God shall take the kingdom: and they shall possess the kingdom for ever and ever.'
      v:019: 'DAG:7:19 | 19 | 19 | After this I would diligently learn concerning the fourth beast, which was very different from all, and exceeding terrible: his teeth and claws were of iron: he devoured and broke in pieces, and the rest he stamped upon with his feet:'
      v:020: 'DAG:7:20 | 20 | 20 | And concerning the ten horns that he had on his head: and concerning the other that came up, before which three horns fell: and of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and was greater than the rest.'
      v:021: 'DAG:7:21 | 21 | 21 | I beheld, and lo, that horn made war against the saints, and prevailed over them,'
      v:022: 'DAG:7:22 | 22 | 22 | Till the ancient of days came and gave judgment to the saints of the most High, and the time came, and the saints obtained the kingdom.'
      v:023: 'DAG:7:23 | 23 | 23 | And thus he said: The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be greater than all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.'
      v:024: 'DAG:7:24 | 24 | 24 | And the ten horns of the same kingdom, shall be ten kings: and another shall rise up after them, and he shall be mightier than the former, and he shall bring down three kings.'
      v:025: 'DAG:7:25 | 25 | 25 | And he shall speak words against the High One, and shall crush the saints of the most High: and he shall think himself able to change times and laws, and they shall be delivered into his hand until a time, and times, and half a time.'
      v:026: 'DAG:7:26 | 26 | 26 | And judgment shall sit, that <i>his</i> power may be taken away, and be broken in pieces, and perish even to the end.'
      v:027: 'DAG:7:27 | 27 | 27 | And that the kingdom, and power, and the greatness of the kingdom, under the whole heaven, may be given to the people of the saints of the most High: whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all kings shall serve him, and shall obey him.'
      v:028: 'DAG:7:28 | 28 | 28 | Hitherto is the end of the word. I, Daniel, was much troubled with my thoughts, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the word in my heart.'

        - 'DAG:8:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Castle;</i> some read "city." Here the kings had a palace; and Hystaspes, &c. generally resided in it. Nabuchodonosor seems to have subdued Elam. Cyrus had it for his share; but Darius, the Mede, appears from Eschylus to have plundered Susa again. Daniel probably spent the latter part of his life in this city. (Calmet) --- <i>Gate,</i> or "stagnant water;" (<i>paludem.</i> ver. 3.; Haydock) though most understand the river Euleus, on the side of Susiana.

Others think that he alludes to Codomannus, whom Alexander certainly attacked. --- <i>Afterward</i> is not in Hebrew. St. Jerome supposed that another <i>ram</i> was designated, but it is the same.'
      v:004:
        - 'DAG:8:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>South.</i> Codomannus reigned in peace for two years, when he was invaded. But his predecessors had made war chiefly in Greece, Scythia, and Egypt. The stupendous preparations of Xerxes against Greece only accelerated the fall of his own kingdom, by irritating the two nations. (Calmet)'

(Challoner) --- He succeeded his father when only twenty years old, and the next year was chosen generalissimo of the Greeks against Persia, which he invaded at the head of 30,000 foot and 4,000 horses, having only seventy talents of silver and provisions for one month. With this he attacked the most flourishing empire, and conquered it in less than four years' time, when Darius was slain in the year of the world 3674 [326 B.C.]. Alexander survived only six years and ten months, yet subdued so many nations that it is almost incredible that he should have travelled over them. He is the belly of brass and the leopard, chap. ii. 39., and vii. 6. (Calmet) --- He died in the midst of his prosperity, (Haydock) when not quite thirty-three years old, (Worthington) and left no heirs to succeed him. This conqueror would be painted with two horns, to intimate that he was the son of Jupiter Ammon. (Calmet)"

(Challoner) --- Other generals held out for some time. Philip was only a nominal king; Antipater governed Macedon and Greece. Syria, Asia, and Egypt, formed three other kingdoms. All four marked out by the four heads of the leopard, chap. vii. 6. But the prophet is intent upon Syria and Egypt, which had most to do with the Jews. (Calmet)'

While several contended for the high priesthood, and imitated the manners of the Greeks, the sacrifices were neglected, and then Antiochus prevailed, 2 Machabees iv. 7. --- <i>Ground.</i> The ambitious pontiffs, as well as the king and his officers, kept not their promises. Onias, the lawful high priest, being displaced, went to seek redress at Antioch, in the asylum at Daphne. Andronicus prevailed on him to come out by treacherous promises, and slew him; whereupon even Epiphanes wept, and ordered the murderer to be punished, 2 Machabees iv. 32. The following year he entered Jerusalem, and committed horrible profanations.'
      v:013:
        - "DAG:8:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Another.</i> We do not inquire how the angels explained themselves, or whether they instruct each other. This conversation was for the prophet's information. (Calmet) --- One angel asked the other a question about futurity. (Worthington)"

(Challoner) --- He began in the year 143, and died in the year 149, according to the era of Seleucus. (Haydock) --- The temple was purified in the mean time, 1 Machabees i. 21., and vi. 16. (Worthington) --- Full days are specified. Sacrifice entirely ceased for three years, in the year 145, chap. vii. 25. Symmachus has 2,400, others 2,200, as quoted by St. Jerome. We know not whether the solar year of 365 days, or the lunar of 354, be meant.'

      v:001: 'DAG:8:1 | 1 | 1 | In {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}the third year of the reign of king Baltassar, a vision appeared to me. I, Daniel, after what I had seen in the beginning,'
      v:002: 'DAG:8:2 | 2 | 2 | Saw in my vision when I was in the castle of Susa, which is in the province of Elam: and I saw in the vision that I was over the gate of Ulai.'
      v:003: 'DAG:8:3 | 3 | 3 | And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold a ram stood before the water, having <i>two</i> high horns, and one higher than the other, and growing up. Afterward'
      v:004: 'DAG:8:4 | 4 | 4 | I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west, and against the north, and against the south: and no beasts could withstand him, nor be delivered out of his hand: and he did according to his own will, and became great.'
      v:005: 'DAG:8:5 | 5 | 5 | And I understood: and behold a he-goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and he touched not the ground, and the he-goat had a notable horn between his eyes.'
      v:006: 'DAG:8:6 | 6 | 6 | And he went up to the ram that had the horns, which I had seen standing before the gate, and he ran towards him in the force of his strength.'
      v:007: 'DAG:8:7 | 7 | 7 | And when he was come near the ram, he was enraged against him, and struck the ram: and broke his two horns, and the ram could not withstand him: and when he had cast him down on the ground, he stamped upon him, and none could deliver the ram out of his hand.'
      v:008: 'DAG:8:8 | 8 | 8 | And the he-goat became exceeding great: and when he was grown, the great horn was broken, and there came up four horns under it towards the four winds of heaven.'
      v:009: 'DAG:8:9 | 9 | 9 | And out of one of them came forth a little horn: and it became great against the south, and against the east, and against the strength.'
      v:010: 'DAG:8:10 | 10 | 10 | And it was magnified even unto the strength of heaven: and it threw down of the strength, and of the stars, and trod upon them.'
      v:011: 'DAG:8:11 | 11 | 11 | And it was magnified even to the prince of the strength: and it took away from him the continual sacrifice, and cast down the place of his sanctuary.'
      v:012: 'DAG:8:12 | 12 | 12 | And strength was given him against the continual sacrifice because of sins: and truth shall be cast down on the ground, and he shall do and shall prosper.'
      v:013: 'DAG:8:13 | 13 | 13 | And I heard one of the saints speaking, and one saint said to another I know not to whom, that was speaking: How long shall be the vision, concerning the continual sacrifice, and the sin of the desolation that is made: and the sanctuary, and the strength be trodden under foot?'
      v:014: 'DAG:8:14 | 14 | 14 | And he said to him: Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred days: and the sanctuary shall be cleansed.'
      v:015: 'DAG:8:15 | 15 | 15 | And it came to pass when I, Daniel, saw the vision, and sought the meaning, that behold there stood before me as it were the appearance of a man.'
      v:016: 'DAG:8:16 | 16 | 16 | And I heard the voice of a man between Ulai: and he called, and said: Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.'
      v:017: 'DAG:8:17 | 17 | 17 | And he came and stood near where I stood: and when he was come, I fell on my face trembling, and he said to me: Understand, O son of man, for in the time of the end the vision shall be fulfilled.'
      v:018: 'DAG:8:18 | 18 | 18 | And when he spoke to me, I fell flat on the ground: and he touched me, and set me upright,'
      v:019: 'DAG:8:19 | 19 | 19 | And he said to me: I will shew thee what things are to come to pass in the end of the malediction: for the time hath its end.'
      v:020: 'DAG:8:20 | 20 | 20 | The ram, which thou sawest with horns, is the king of the Medes and Persians.'
      v:021: 'DAG:8:21 | 21 | 21 | And the he-goat, is the king of the Greeks, and the great horn that was between his eyes, the same is the first king.'
      v:022: 'DAG:8:22 | 22 | 22 | But whereas when that was broken, there arose up four for it, four kings shall rise up of his nation, but not with his strength.'
      v:023: 'DAG:8:23 | 23 | 23 | And after their reign, when iniquities shall be grown up, there shall arise a king of a shameless face, and understanding dark sentences.'
      v:024: 'DAG:8:24 | 24 | 24 | And his power shall be strengthened, but not by his own force: and he shall lay all things waste, and shall prosper, and do more than can be believed. And he shall destroy the mighty, and the people of the saints,'
      v:025: 'DAG:8:25 | 25 | 25 | According to his will, and craft shall be successful in his hand: and his heart shall be puffed up, and in the abundance of all things he shall kill many: and he shall rise up against the prince of princes, and shall be broken without hand.'
      v:026: 'DAG:8:26 | 26 | 26 | And the vision of the evening and the morning, which was told, is true: thou, therefore, seal up the vision, because it shall come to pass after many days.'
      v:027: "DAG:8:27 | 27 | 27 | And I, Daniel, languished, and was sick for some days: and when I was risen up, I did the king's business, and I was astonished at the vision, and there was none that could interpret it."

        - "DAG:9:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Darius,</i> the Mede, chap. v. 31. If his reign had commenced at the same time with that of Cyrus, at Babylon, as it is commonly supposed, Daniel would have been under no anxiety respecting the people's liberation, as it took place that year, (Calmet) though perhaps not at the commencement. (Haydock) --- Cyrus had now ruled over the Persians above two years, so that the first of Darius at Babylon agrees with the third of his reign over his countrymen, chap. x. (Calmet) --- <i>Assuerus,</i> or Achasuerus, is not a proper name, but means \"a great prince.\" (Worthington)"
      v:002:

Knowing that many predictions were conditional, he was afraid lest this might be so; notwithstanding a part of it seemed to be verified by the death of Baltassar. (Calmet) --- Darius had reigned in Persia before. He only ruled part of a year, at Babylon, the 70th of the captivity, 2 Paralipomenon xxxvi. 22. Daniel perceiving that the time of the Jews' deliverance was at hand, prayed with great zeal and confidence. (Worthington)"

      v:024:
        - 'DAG:9:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Seventy weeks</i> (viz. of years, or seventy times seven, that is, 490 years) <i>are shortened;</i> that is, fixed and determined, so that the time shall be no longer. (Challoner) --- This is not a conditional prophecy. Daniel was solicitous to know when the seventy years of Jeremias would terminate. But something of far greater consequence is revealed to him, (Worthington) even the coming and death of the Messias, four hundred and ninety years after the order for rebuilding the walls should be given, (Calmet) at which period Christ would redeem the world, (Worthington) and abolish the sacrifices of the law. (Calmet) --- <i>Finished,</i> or arrive at its height by the crucifixion of the Son of God; (Theod.) or rather sin shall be forgiven. Hebrew, "to finish crimes to seal (<i>cover or remit</i>) sins, and to expiate iniquity." --- <i>Anointed.</i> Christ is the great anointed of God, the source of justice, and the end of the law and of the prophets, (Acts x. 38. and 1 Corinthians i. 30; Romans x. 4.; Calmet) as well as the pardoner of crimes. These four characters belong only to Christ. (Worthington)'
      v:025:
        - "DAG:9:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Word,</i> &c. That is, from the twentieth year of king Artaxerxes, when, by his commandment, Nehemias rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem, 2 Esdras ii. From which time, according to the best chronology, there were just sixty-nine weeks of years, that is 483 years, to the baptism of Christ, when he first began to preach and execute the office of Messias. (Challoner) --- The prophecy is divided into three periods: the first of forty-nine years, during which the walls were completed; (they had been raised in fifty-two days, (2 Esdras vi. 15.) but many other fortifications were still requisite) the second of four hundred and thirty-four years, at the end of which Christ was baptized, in the fifteenth of Tiberius, the third of three years and a half, during which Christ preached. In the middle of this last week, the ancient sacrifices became useless, (Calmet) as the true Lamb of God had been immolated. (Theod.) --- A <i>week</i> of years denotes seven years, as Leviticus xxv. and thus seventy of these weeks would make four hundred and ninety years. (Ven. Bede, Rat. temp. 6 &c.; Worthington) --- Origen would understand 4900 years, and dates from the fall of Adam to the ruin of the temple. Marsham begins twenty-one years after the captivity commenced, when Darius took Susa, and ends in the second of Judas, when the temple was purified. This system would destroy the prediction of Christ's coming, and is very uncertain. Hardouin modifies it, and acknowledges that Christ was the end of the prophecy, though it was fulfilled in figure by the death of Onias III. See 1 Machabees i. 19; Senens. Bib. viii. hær. 12; and Estius. From chap. vii. to xii., the changes in the East, till the time of Epiphanes, are variously described. After the angel had here addressed Daniel, the latter was still perplexed; (Chap. x. 1.) and in order to remove his doubts, the angel informs him of the persecution of Epiphanes, as if he had been speaking of the same event. We may, therefore, count forty-nine years from the taking of Jerusalem (when Jeremias spoke, chap. v. 19.) to Cyrus, <i>the anointed,</i> (Isaias xlv. 1.) who was appointed to free God's people. They should still be under the Persians, &c., for other four hundred and thirty-four years, and then Onias should be slain. Many would join the Machabees; the sacrifices should cease in the middle of the seventieth week, and the desolation shall continue to <i>the end</i> of it. Yet, though this system may seem plausible, it is better to stick to the common one, which naturally leads us to the death of Christ, dating from the tenth year of Artaxerxes. (Calmet) --- He had reigned ten years already with his father. (Petau.) --- All the East was persuaded that a great king should arise about the time; when our Saviour actually appeared, and fulfilled all that had been spoken of the Messias. (Calmet, Diss.) --- Ferguson says, \"We have an astronomical demonstration of the truth of this ancient prophecy, seeing that the prophetic year of the Messias being cut off was the very same with the astronomical.\" In a dispute between a Jew and a Christian, at Venice, the Rabbi who presided....put an end to the business by saying, \"Let us shut up our Bibles; for if we proceed in the examination of this prophecy, it will make us all become Christians.\" (Watson, let. 6.) --- Hence probably the Jews denounce a curse on those who calculate the times, (Haydock) and they have purposely curtailed their chronology. (Calmet) --- <i>Times,</i> &c. (<i>angustia temporum</i>) which may allude both to the difficulties and opposition they met with in building, and to the shortness of the time in which they finished the wall, viz. fifty-two days. (Challoner)"
      v:026:
        - "DAG:9:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Weeks,</i> or four hundred and thirty-eight years, which elapsed from the twentieth of Artaxerxes to the death of Christ, according to the most exact chronologists. (Calmet) --- <i>Slain.</i> Protestants, \"cut off, but not for himself, and the people of the prince that,\" &c. (Haydock) --- St. Jerome and some manuscripts read, <i>Christus, et non erit ejus.</i> The sense is thus suspended. The Jews lose their prerogative of being God's people. (Calmet) --- Christ will not receive them again. (St. Jerome) -- Greek: \"the unction shall be destroyed, and there shall not be judgment in him.\" The priesthood and royal dignity is taken from the Jews. (Theod.) --- The order of succession among the high priests was quite deranged, while the country was ruled by the Romans, and by Herod, a foreigner. (Calmet) --- <i>Leader.</i> The Romans under Titus. (Challoner; Calmet)"
      v:027:
        - 'DAG:9:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Many.</i> Christ seems to allude to this passage, Matthew xxvi. 28. He died for all; but several of the Jews particularly, would not receive the proffered grace. (Calmet) --- <i>Of the week,</i> or in the middle of the week, &c. Because Christ preached three years and a half: and then, by his sacrifice upon the cross, abolished all the sacrifices of the law. (Challoner) --- <i>Temple.</i> Hebrew, "the wing," (Calmet) or pinnacle, (Haydock) the highest part of the temple. (Calmet) --- <i>Desolation.</i> Some understand this of the profanation of the temple by the crimes of the Jews, and by the bloody faction of the zealots. Others, of the bringing in thither the ensigns and standard of the pagan Romans. Others, in fine, distinguish three different times of desolation: viz. that under Antiochus; that when the temple was destroyed by the Romans; and the last near the end of the world, under antichrist. To all which, as they suppose, this prophecy may have a relation. (Challoner) --- Protestants, "For the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even unto the consummation; and that determined, shall be poured upon the desolate." (Haydock) --- The ruin shall be entire. (Calmet)'

Others assert that this was an evil angel; for how could a good one oppose so long the will of God? Yet this argument may be retorted, as evil spirits themselves must comply. It seems, therefore, that Cyrus was exhorted by the good angels to invade the Chaldeans, and thus to liberate God's people.

(Just. xxx.) --- He followed the suggestions of his proud <i>heart,</i> when he attempted to enter the most holy place of the temple; and though he was visibly chastised by God, he would have vented his resentment on the Jews, if Providence had not miraculously protected them. (3 Machabees; Calmet) See Ecclesiasticus l. (Haydock)'

When Philopator was dead, and his son Epiphanes not above five years old, Antiochus and Philip of Macedon basely attempted to divide his dominions.

(Calmet) --- Many revolted in Egypt on account of the arrogance of Agathocles, who ruled in the king's name, ver. 14. (St. Jerome)"

All allow that he transgressed the law, by offering sacrifice there after God had pitched upon Jerusalem. But this was done (Calmet) under Philometor, forty-seven years (Usher) or longer after <i>those times,</i> when Epiphanes fought against Antiochus. The rebellion of the Jews against Egypt may therefore be meant. It was decreed that they should be under Antiochus, that his son might cause them to <i>fall,</i> (Calmet) and punish them for their crimes. (Haydock)'

(Challoner) --- He came with her to Raphia, and gave her Judea, &c. for her dowry, reserving half of the revenues. Hebrew and Greek have, "to corrupt her;" (Calmet) Vulgate <i>eam;</i> as he wished his daughter to act perfidiously, that he might seize the whole kingdom.

(Challoner) --- Protestants, "for a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease, without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him." (Haydock) --- Being defeated at Magnesia, he chose the wisest plan of avoiding fresh reproach, by making peace, though (Calmet) the terms were very hard.

What is here said of this prince, is accommodated by St. Jerome and others to antichrist, of whom this Antiochus was a figure. (Challoner) --- He lived and died basely; as the origin and end of antichrist will be ignominious. (Worthington) --- All that follows, to the end of chap. xii., regards Epiphanes. He had no title to the crown, which he procured by cunning, and held in the most shameful manner. He canvassed for the lowest offices, so that many styled him <i>Epimanes,</i> :"the madman."

        - 'DAG:11:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Fighter.</i> That is, of them that shall oppose him, and shall fight against him. (Challoner) --- Heliodorus, who had murdered his brother and usurped the throne, and Ptolemy Epiphanes, were discomfited. The latter was making preparations against Seleucus, and said that his riches were in the purses of his friends, upon which they poisoned him. (St. Jerome) (Calmet) --- <i>Covenant,</i> or <i>of the league.</i> The chief of them that conspired against him; or the king of Egypt, his most powerful adversary. (Challoner) --- This title belongs to antichrist, who will join the Jews, and be received as their Messias. (St. Irenæus v. 25.; St. Jerome, &c. Jo. 543.) (Worthington)'

      v:026:
        - 'DAG:11:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Slain.</i> This was the perfidious policy of Epiphanes, who expected that the two brothers would destroy each other, so that he might easily seize Egypt, of which he kept the key, retaining the city of Pelusium. They were however reconciled, and reigned together. The Scripture often represents that as done which is only intended.'

(Livy xliv.) --- <i>Romans.</i> Popilius and the other Roman ambassadors, who came in galleys, and obliged him to depart from Egypt. (Challoner) --- He was only four or seven miles from Alexandria, and went to meet the ambassadors, who gave him the senate's letter, ordering him to desist from the war. He said he would consult his friends: but Popilius formed a circle round him with his wand, requiring an answer before he went out of it. Hereupon the king withdrew his forces. (Polyb. xcii.; V.

(Calmet) --- <i>Women.</i> He kept many concubines, (Diod.) and committed the greatest obscenities publicly: <i>mimis et scortis.</i> (St. Jerome) --- Hebrew may have quite a different sense. He had no regard for the sex, (Calmet) killing all indiscriminately. (Grotius)'
      v:038:
        - 'DAG:11:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>The god Maozim.</i> That is, the god of <i>forces</i> or <i>strong holds.</i> (Challoner) --- <i>Mahuzzim</i> denotes "strong ones," (Haydock) <i>guardians,</i> &c. Dr. Newton (Diss.) explains, the <i>king</i> (ver. 36) of the Roman state; and supposes that here the <i>guardian saints</i> and angels are meant, whose worship he shews "began in the Roman empire, very soon after it became Christian. This exposition seems far preferable to that which interprets" <i>Jupiter</i> or <i>the heavens,</i> and understands the idol set up by Epiphanes. See Univ. Hist. x. Parkhurst. --- If these authors speak of the inferior veneration shewn to saints and angels in the Catholic Church, it had a much earlier commencement, being coeval with religion itself. But only the blindest prejudice can represent this as idolatrous, and of course this system must fall to the ground. (Haydock) --- Others suppose that Mars, Hercules, <i>Azizus,</i> or Jupiter, may be designated. Hebrew, "He will rise up against all, (<b>38</b>) and against the strong God (<i>of Israel,</i> ver. 31., and chap. viii.. 10.; Calmet) he will, in his place, worship a strange god, " &c. (Junius) --- None of the ancestors of Epiphanes had ever adored Jupiter on the altar of holocausts. (Calmet) --- He and antichrist adore either the great Jupiter or their own strength. (Worthington)'

      v:040:
        - 'DAG:11:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Fight.</i> Epiphanes made war on Egypt, till the Romans forced him to desist. The prophet explains his preceding attempts, to which he only alluded, ver. 29, 30.'

      v:045:
        - 'DAG:11:45 | 45 | 45 | <i>Apadno.</i> Some take it for the proper name of a place; others, from the Hebrew translate it, <i>his palace.</i> (Challoner) --- He fixed his royal tent between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. (Worthington) ---Porphyrius explains this of the march beyond the Euphrates, which St. Jerome does not disapprove. Apadno may denote Mesopotamia, which is styled Padan Aram. --- <i>Glorious.</i> Hebrew <i>Zebi,</i> (Calmet) or <i>Tsebi,</i> (Haydock) may allude to Mount Taba, where the king perished, without <i>help,</i> 1 Machabees vi. 11., and 2 Machabees ix. 9.  St. Jerome and many others explain all this of antichrist, and no doubt he was prefigured. The like events will probably take place again towards the end of the world. But as the particulars cannot be ascertained, we have adhered to the history of Antiochus. (Calmet)'

Only about seven thousand ill-armed men adhered to Judas: yet these delivered the country by God's decree. --- <i>Book.</i> God seemed to keep a register of his friends. (Calmet) --- Michael, the guardian of the Church, will protect her against antichrist, as her pastors will do visibly. (Worthington)"

In a figurative sense, the Jews who seemed buried shall appear and fight. --- <i>To see.</i> Hebrew, "everlasting." (Calmet) --- St. Jerome has not seen a <i>d</i> (Haydock) in the word. This text is express for eternal happiness or misery. (Calmet) --- Some have understood, <i>deraon,</i> "stench," or contempt, to denote the ignominy of the damned; but the prophet speaks of the times of the Machabees. (Houbigant.) --- All shall rise in their bodies, but all shall not be changed for the better, 1 Corinthians xv. 51. (Worthington)'

(Challoner) --- Hebrew, "instructors." --- <i>Instruct.</i> Hebrew, "justify," in the same sense. The Machabees and other priests, &c. who instructed people in the law, and stood up for its defence, may be meant. (Calmet) --- "There is as much difference between a learned sanctity and a holy rusticity, as there is between heaven and the stars." (St. Jerome) --- Teachers, martyrs, and virgins are entitled to an <i>aureola,</i> or accidental reward, besides the essential beatitude. (Worthington) --- <i>Many.</i> Th.[Theodotion?] and the Vulgate read, "and of the just many <i>shall be</i> like for an age and after." (St. Jerome)'

      v:007:
        - "DAG:12:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Heaven.</i> He thus shews that he is not God. (Calmet) --- <i>Time</i> often implies a year, chap. iv. 13. Hence he means three years and a half. Christ assures us that those days shall be <i>shortened,</i> (Matthew xxiv. 22.) and the persecutor shall tarry a <i>short time,</i> Apocalypse xvii. 10., and xii. 14. The same period is insinuated by 1290 days, (ver. 11) and 1330, ver. 12. The two witnesses prophesy 1260 days, during which the Church shall be fed in the wilderness, Apocalypse xii. 6. But the term is most exactly specified by forty-two months, Apocalypse xi. 2., and xiii. 5. Hence all the Fathers agree that the last persecution shall continue no longer. (Worthington) --- How absurdly do some Protestants explain this of <i>years</i> during which, they say, the papacy shall subsist! Whence will they date its origin? But they will readily trifle with the word of God, and admit any one to indulge his fancy, as long as he does not strike at the thirty-nine articles. If he do, he may expect the treatment of poor Stone, (Haydock) whose death in the King's Bench, aged 75, has been just announced. He pleaded that one article decided, \"nothing was to be maintained which could not be proved by Scripture.\" Yet he was deprived of his living by Dr. Porteus, who at one time was as eager to procure a change in the articles, yet was not prevented by his scruples from mounting the episcopal throne of Chester or of London. Stone had not this <i>discretion.</i> (Rock. N. 306.) He fell a victim to contradictory articles. He might be in error. But what right had Proteus to throw the first stone at him? or how will Protestants shew that any man is reprehensible for adopting the principles of the Reformation, which was entirely built on private interpretation? They applaud Luther, who established Scripture self-interpreted for the only rule, and they condemn Stone, Wesley, &c. for acting accordingly. If they have such <i>just weights and measures</i> for their own, what wonder then if the rights of Catholics be disregarded? (Haydock) --- <i>Half a time.</i> The idol of Jupiter remained just three years. Yet the temple was not ready for sacrifices till other ten days had elapsed. They had been interrupted six months before that idol was set up. (Calmet) --- We must date from the profanation and distress caused by Apollonius, 1 Machabees iv. 52. (Jos. [Josephus?]; S. Hypol. [St. Hippolytus?]; Usher, the year of the world 3836.; Calmet) --- <i>Band.</i> Literally, \"hand.\" (Haydock) --- When the people shall be destitute of strength, God will miraculously deliver them."

What regarded Antiochus and the Church was almost inexplicable before the event, as the times of antichrist are to us, ver. 9.'

      v:011:
        - "DAG:12:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Days:</i> thirteen more than three and a half, as we reckon. The odd number might be neglected, ver. 7. The abomination continued three years and ten days, but the sacrifices had been discontinued six months and three days before. See Chap. viii. 14. If Daniel speak of lunar years, as it is probable, the difference would only be two days. (Calmet) --- From the abolishing of the mass as much as possible, and the practice of heresy and <i>abomination,</i> unto the end of antichrist's persecution, 1290 days shall elapse. (Worthington)"
      v:012:
        - 'DAG:12:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Days.</i> After the three years and a half, fifty-eight days will occur before the death of Antiochus, when Judas will disperse the troops of his three generals. (Calmet) --- Some respite will be granted for forty-five days, during which sinners may repent. (Menochius) --- It is difficult to say why forty-five days are here added to the former number. We are content to depart with Daniel, (ver. 9.) without searching any farther into these high mysteries. (Worthington)'

(Calmet) --- According to the order of time, it should be placed after the first chapter. (Menochius)"

(Calmet) --- The captives under Joakim, were better treated than those who were taken nineteen years afterwards, when all fell into a heavier bondage. (Worthington) --- The might enjoy possessions, (Haydock) and have judges of their nation. (Calmet) --- Cappel. urges this difficulty, and many others, to shew that this account is fabulous. But as the Jews were allowed to follow their religion, the Chaldeans would strive to keep them in good order. It is not said that Joakim was one of the captives. He might have settled long before at Babylon, where Helcias probably brought up his daughter in the fear of God, ver. 3.

    intro: 'This history of Susanna, in all the ancient Greek and Latin Bibles, was placed in the beginning of the Book of Daniel, till St. Jerome, in his translation, detached it from thence, because he did not find it in the Hebrew; which is also the case of the history of Bel and the dragon. But both the one and the other are received by the Catholic Church, and were from the very beginning a part of the Christian Bible. (Challoner) --- Daniel seems not to have written the history of Susanna, at least in the volume which contains his prophecies, though it be unquestionably canonical. (Cornelius a Lapide) --- It has been doubted whether it was ever in Hebrew. (Calmet) --- But Origen solves the difficulties of Africanus. (Haydock) --- Susanna means "lily," and is proposed as a pattern of conjugal chastity. (Calmet) --- Daniel was about twelve years old when he disclosed the malice of her accusers.

      v:027: 'DAG:13:27 | 27 | 27 | But after the old men had spoken, the servants were greatly ashamed: for never had there been any such word said of Susanna. And on the next day,'
      v:028: 'DAG:13:28 | 28 | 28 | When the people were come to Joakim, her husband, the two elders also came full of wicked device against Susanna, to put her to death.'
      v:029: 'DAG:13:29 | 29 | 29 | And they said before the people: Send to Susanna, daughter of Helcias, the wife of Joakim. And presently they sent.'
      v:030: 'DAG:13:30 | 30 | 30 | And she came with her parents, and children, and all her kindred.'
      v:031: 'DAG:13:31 | 31 | 31 | Now Susanna was exceeding delicate, and beautiful to behold.'
      v:032: 'DAG:13:32 | 32 | 32 | But those wicked men commanded that her face should be uncovered, (for she was covered) that so at least they might be satisfied with her beauty.'
      v:033: 'DAG:13:33 | 33 | 33 | Therefore her friends, and all her acquaintance wept.'
      v:034: 'DAG:13:34 | 34 | 34 | But the two elders rising up in the midst of the people, laid their hands upon her head.'
      v:035: 'DAG:13:35 | 35 | 35 | And she weeping looked up to heaven, for her heart had confidence in the Lord.'
      v:036: 'DAG:13:36 | 36 | 36 | And the elders said: As we walked in the orchard alone, this woman came in with two maids, and shut the doors of the orchard, and sent away the maids from her.'
      v:037: 'DAG:13:37 | 37 | 37 | Then a young man that was there hid came to her, and lay with her.'
      v:038: 'DAG:13:38 | 38 | 38 | But we that were in a corner of the orchard, seeing this wickedness, ran up to them, and we saw them lie together.'
      v:039: 'DAG:13:39 | 39 | 39 | And him indeed we could not take, because he was stronger than us, and opening the doors, he leaped out:'
      v:040: 'DAG:13:40 | 40 | 40 | But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was, but she would not tell us: of this thing we are witnesses.'
      v:041: 'DAG:13:41 | 41 | 41 | The multitude believed them, as being the elders, and the judges of the people, and they condemned her to death.'
      v:042: 'DAG:13:42 | 42 | 42 | Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said: O eternal God, who knowest hidden things, who knowest all things before they come to pass,'
      v:043: 'DAG:13:43 | 43 | 43 | Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me: and behold I must die, whereas I have done none of these things, which these men have maliciously forged against me.'
      v:044: DAG:13:44 | 44 | 44 | And the Lord heard her voice.
      v:045: 'DAG:13:45 | 45 | 45 | And when she was led to be put to death, the Lord raised up the holy spirit of a young boy, whose name was Daniel:'
      v:046: 'DAG:13:46 | 46 | 46 | And he cried out with a loud voice: I am clear from the blood of this woman.'
      v:047: 'DAG:13:47 | 47 | 47 | Then all the people turning themselves towards him, said: What meaneth this word that thou hast spoken?'
      v:048: 'DAG:13:48 | 48 | 48 | But he standing in the midst of them, said: Are ye so foolish, ye children of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of the truth, you have condemned a daughter of Israel?'
      v:049: 'DAG:13:49 | 49 | 49 | Return to judgment, for they have borne false witness against her.'
      v:050: 'DAG:13:50 | 50 | 50 | So all the people turned again in haste, and the old men said to him: Come, and sit thou down among us, and shew it us: seeing God hath given thee the honour of old age.'
      v:051: 'DAG:13:51 | 51 | 51 | And Daniel said to the people: Separate these two far from one another, and I will examine them.'
      v:052: 'DAG:13:52 | 52 | 52 | So when they were put asunder one from the other, he called one of them, and said to him: O thou that art grown old in evil days, now are thy sins come <i>out</i>, which thou hast committed before:'
      v:053: 'DAG:13:53 | 53 | 53 | In judging unjust judgments, oppressing the innocent, and letting the guilty to go free, whereas the Lord saith: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}The innocent and the just thou shalt not kill.'
      v:054: 'DAG:13:54 | 54 | 54 | Now then if thou sawest her, tell me under what tree thou sawest them conversing together: He said: Under a mastic tree.'
      v:055: 'DAG:13:55 | 55 | 55 | And Daniel said: Well hast thou lied against thy own head: for behold the angel of God having received the sentence of him, shall cut thee in two.'
      v:056: 'DAG:13:56 | 56 | 56 | And having put him aside, he commanded that the other should come, and he said to him: O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beauty hath deceived thee, and lust hath perverted thy heart:'
      v:057: 'DAG:13:57 | 57 | 57 | Thus did you do to the daughters of Israel, and they for fear conversed with you: but a daughter of Juda would not abide your wickedness.'
      v:058: 'DAG:13:58 | 58 | 58 | Now, therefore, tell me, under what tree didst thou take them conversing together. And he answered: Under a holm tree.'
      v:059: 'DAG:13:59 | 59 | 59 | And Daniel said to him: Well hast thou also lied against thy own head: for the angel of the Lord waiteth with a sword to cut thee in two, and to destroy you.'
      v:060: 'DAG:13:60 | 60 | 60 | With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, and they blessed God, who saveth them that trust in him.'
      v:061: 'DAG:13:61 | 61 | 61 | And they rose up against the two elders, (for Daniel had convicted them of false witness by their own mouth) and they did to them as they had maliciously dealt against their neighbour,'
      v:062: 'DAG:13:62 | 62 | 62 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}To fulfill the law of Moses: and they put them to death, and innocent blood was saved in that day.'
      v:063: 'DAG:13:63 | 63 | 63 | But Helcias, and his wife, praised God, for their daughter, Susanna, with Joakim, her husband, and all her kindred, because there was no dishonesty found in her.'
      v:064: 'DAG:13:64 | 64 | 64 | And Daniel became great in the sight of the people from that day, and thence forward.'
      v:065: 'DAG:13:65 | 65 | 65 | And king Astyages was gathered to his fathers; and Cyrus, the Persian, received his kingdom.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'DAG:14:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Guest.</i> It seems most probable that the king here spoken of was Evilmerodac, the son and successor of Nabuchodonosor, and great favourer of the Jews; (Challoner; Worthington) or it might be Darius, (Houbigant.) or Cyrus, under whose reign St. Irenæus (iv. 11.) and others place this history. (Calmet) --- The more correct Greek editions begin with the preceding verse. (Menochius) --- Septuagint read, "Prophecy of Abaum, son of Juda, of the tribe of Levi. There was a priest, Daniel, son of Abda, who was a guest of the king of Babylon," &c. See Pref. (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - 'DAG:14:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Angry.</i> Cappel thinks the priests would not be so easily caught, or that such an imposture would not be so long concealed. But it was their interest to keep the secret, particularly if the king furnished the provisions; and in the night time they would not perceive the small ashes. (Houbigant.) --- The pagans stupidly believed (Calmet) that the idols eat. (Aristophanes, Plutus. iii. 2.) --- All the objections against this history are refuted by Jeremias li. 5. (Houbigant.) --- It is wonderful that so learned a man as Cappel should urge so many. (Haydock)'
      v:022:
        - 'DAG:14:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Dragon.</i> The devil had seduced our first parents in the form of a serpent, and caused most nations to adore it. (Calmet) --- They expected benefit, or to be preserved from harm. (Valer. i. 8.; St. Augustine, de Civ. Dei. xiv. 11.; Worthington)'
      v:026:
        - 'DAG:14:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Asunder,</i> being choked, and not poisoned. (Vales. 81.) (Menochius) --- The throat is narrow. (Solin. 43.)'
      v:027:
        - 'DAG:14:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Jew,</i> or "a Jew is king;" Daniel governs all. (Grotius)'
      v:028:
        - 'DAG:14:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>House.</i> Religion is daring. Darius was weak, and only a sort of viceroy, left by Cyrus. (Houbigant.)'
      v:030:
        - "DAG:14:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>The den of lions.</i> Daniel was twice cast into the den of lions: once under Darius, the Mede, because he had transgressed the king's edict, by praying three times a day; and another time under Evilmerodac, by a sedition of the people. This time he remained six days in the lions' den; the other time only one night. (Challoner)"
      v:031:
        - 'DAG:14:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Carcasses:</i> people condemned, (Calmet) or dead. (Houbigant.)'
      v:032:
        - 'DAG:14:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Habacuc.</i> The same, as some think, whose prophecy is found among the lesser prophets: but others believe him to be different. (Challoner) --- About twenty years before there was no prophet in Judea, chap. iii. 38. Habacuc, the eighth of the minor prophets, lived before the Babylonian monarchy was formed, chap. i. 6. (Worthington) --- Yet he might still survive. If this had not been a true history, such an extraordinary mode of conveyance would not have been mentioned. Cappel imagines it was an allusion to Philip, the deacon, and fabricated by some Christian. But Theodotion found it in Hebrew (Houbigant.) and he was no friend to Christianity when he wrote; though he had once followed Tatian, and the Marcionites. (Haydock)'
      v:039:
        - 'DAG:14:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Seventh.</i> He had not come before, supposing he was dead, till at last a rumour got to his ears, notwithstanding the precautions of the Babylonians, who hoped that Daniel would be starved to death. (Houbigant, Proleg. p. 2. p. 425 which end here.)'
      v:040:
        - 'DAG:14:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Daniel.</i> Greek adds, "besides thee there is no other." (Haydock)'
      v:041:
        - 'DAG:14:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Den,</i> by the law of retaliation, chap. vi. 24. (Menochius)'
      v:042:
        - 'DAG:14:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>Then,</i> &c. is not in Greek nor in the ancient manuscripts of St. Jerome. The verse may be taken from chap. ii. 26. (Calmet)'

      v:001: "DAG:14:1 | 1 | 1 | And Daniel was the king's guest, and was honoured above all his friends."
      v:002: 'DAG:14:2 | 2 | 2 | Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel: and there was spent upon him every day twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and sixty vessels of wine.'
      v:003: 'DAG:14:3 | 3 | 3 | The king also worshipped him, and went every day to adore him: but Daniel adored his God. And the king said to him: Why dost thou not adore Bel?'
      v:004: 'DAG:14:4 | 4 | 4 | And he answered, and said to him: Because I do not worship idols made with hands, but the living God, that created heaven and earth, and hath power over all flesh.'
      v:005: 'DAG:14:5 | 5 | 5 | And the king said to him: Doth not Bel seem to thee to be a living god? Seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh every day?'
      v:006: 'DAG:14:6 | 6 | 6 | Then Daniel smiled, and said: O king, be not deceived: for this is but clay within, and brass without, neither hath he eaten at any time.'
      v:007: 'DAG:14:7 | 7 | 7 | And the king being angry, called for his priests, and said to them: If you tell me not who it is that eateth up these expenses, you shall die.'
      v:008: 'DAG:14:8 | 8 | 8 | But if you can shew that Bel eateth these things, Daniel shall die, because he hath blasphemed against Bel. And Daniel said to the king: Be it done according to thy word.'
      v:009: 'DAG:14:9 | 9 | 9 | Now the priests of Bel were seventy, besides their wives, and little ones, and children. And the king went with Daniel into the temple of Bel.'
      v:010: 'DAG:14:10 | 10 | 10 | And the priests of Bel said: Behold we go out: and do thou, O king, set on the meats, and make ready the wine, and shut the door fast, and seal it with thy own ring:'
      v:011: 'DAG:14:11 | 11 | 11 | And when thou comest in the morning, if thou findest not that Bel hath eaten up all, we will suffer death, or else Daniel, that hath lied against us.'
      v:012: 'DAG:14:12 | 12 | 12 | And they little regarded it, because they had made under the table a secret entrance, and they always came in by it, and consumed those things.'
      v:013: "DAG:14:13 | 13 | 13 | So it came to pass after they were gone out, the king set the meats before Bel: and Daniel commanded his servants, and they brought ashes, and he sifted them all over the temple before the king: and going forth, they shut the door, and having sealed it with the king's ring, they departed."
      v:014: 'DAG:14:14 | 14 | 14 | But the priests went in by night, according to their custom, with their wives, and their children: and they eat and drank up all.'
      v:015: 'DAG:14:15 | 15 | 15 | And the king arose early in the morning, and Daniel with him.'
      v:016: 'DAG:14:16 | 16 | 16 | And the king said: Are the seals whole, Daniel? And he answered: They are whole, O king.'
      v:017: 'DAG:14:17 | 17 | 17 | And as soon as he had opened the door, the king looked upon the table, and cried out with a loud voice: Great art thou, O Bel, and there is not any deceit with thee.'
      v:018: 'DAG:14:18 | 18 | 18 | And Daniel laughed: and he held the king, that he should not go in: and he said: Behold the pavement, mark whose footsteps these are.'
      v:019: 'DAG:14:19 | 19 | 19 | And the king said: I see the footsteps of men, and women, and children. And the king was angry.'
      v:020: 'DAG:14:20 | 20 | 20 | Then he took the priests, and their wives, and their children: and they shewed him the private doors by which they came in, and consumed the things that were on the table.'
      v:021: 'DAG:14:21 | 21 | 21 | The king, therefore, put them to death, and delivered Bel into the power of Daniel: who destroyed him and his temple.'
      v:022: 'DAG:14:22 | 22 | 22 | And there was a great dragon in that place, and the Babylonians worshipped him.'
      v:023: 'DAG:14:23 | 23 | 23 | And the king said to Daniel: Behold, thou canst not say now, that this is not a living god: adore him, therefore.'
      v:024: 'DAG:14:24 | 24 | 24 | And Daniel said: I adore the Lord, my God: for he is the living God: but that is no living god.'
      v:025: 'DAG:14:25 | 25 | 25 | But give me leave, O king, and I will kill this dragon without sword or club. And the king said: I give thee leave.'
      v:026: "DAG:14:26 | 26 | 26 | Then Daniel took pitch, and fat, and hair, and boiled them together: and he made lumps, and put them into the dragon's mouth, and the dragon burst asunder. And he said: Behold him whom you worshipped."
      v:027: 'DAG:14:27 | 27 | 27 | And when the Babylonians had heard this, they took great indignation: and being gathered together against the king, they said: The king is become a Jew. He hath destroyed Bel, he hath killed the dragon, and he hath put the priests to death.'
      v:028: 'DAG:14:28 | 28 | 28 | And they came to the king, and said: Deliver us Daniel, or else we will destroy thee and thy house.'
      v:029: 'DAG:14:29 | 29 | 29 | And the king saw that they pressed upon him violently: and being constrained by necessity: he delivered Daniel to them.'
      v:030: 'DAG:14:30 | 30 | 30 | And they cast him into the den of lions, and he was there six days.'
      v:031: 'DAG:14:31 | 31 | 31 | And in the den there were seven lions, and they had given to them two carcasses every day, and two sheep: but then they were not given unto them, that they might devour Daniel.'
      v:032: 'DAG:14:32 | 32 | 32 | Now there was in Judea a prophet called Habacuc, and he had boiled pottage, and had broken bread in a bowl: and was going into the field, to carry it to the reapers.'
      v:033: "DAG:14:33 | 33 | 33 | And the angel of the Lord said to Habacuc: Carry the dinner which thou hast into Babylon, to Daniel, who is in the lions' den."
      v:034: 'DAG:14:34 | 34 | 34 | And Habacuc said: Lord, I never saw Babylon, nor do I know the den.'
      v:035: 'DAG:14:35 | 35 | 35 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And the angel of the Lord took him by the top of his head, and carried him by the hair of his head, and set him in Babylon, over the den, in the force of his spirit.'
      v:036: 'DAG:14:36 | 36 | 36 | And Habacuc cried, saying: O Daniel, thou servant of God, take the dinner that God hath sent thee.'
      v:037: 'DAG:14:37 | 37 | 37 | And Daniel said: Thou hast remembered me, O God, and thou hast not forsaken them that love thee.'
      v:038: DAG:14:38 | 38 | 38 | And Daniel arose and eat. And the angel of the Lord presently set Habacuc again in his own place.
      v:039: 'DAG:14:39 | 39 | 39 | And upon the seventh day the king came to bewail Daniel: and he came to the den, and looked in, and behold Daniel was sitting in the midst of the lions.'
      v:040: "DAG:14:40 | 40 | 40 | And the king cried out with a loud voice, saying: Great art thou, O Lord, the God of Daniel. And he drew him out of the lions' den."
      v:041: 'DAG:14:41 | 41 | 41 | But those that had been the cause of his destruction, he cast into the den, and they were devoured in a moment before him.'
      v:042: "DAG:14:42 | 42 | 42 | Then the king said: Let all the inhabitants of the whole earth fear the God of Daniel: for he is the Saviour, working signs, and wonders in the earth: who hath delivered Daniel out of the lions' den."
