      v:000:
        - 'SNG:1:0 | 0 | Title | <i>Canticles.</i> Hebrew <i>shir hashirim asher Lishlomo,</i> "the Canticle of Canticles which <i>is</i> for (Haydock) <i>or</i> according to Solomon," (Menochius) dictated to him by the Holy Ghost.'
      v:001:
        - "SNG:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Let.</i> Hebrew <i>yishakeni,</i> (Haydock) \"kiss <i>or</i> instruct me,\" as if to insinuate that we must raise our thoughts from carnal to spiritual things. --- <i>The.</i> Hebrew, \"kisses.\" --- <i>His mouth.</i> Others I reject. (Menochius) --- The synagogue prays for Christ's coming, as the Church does for his glorious appearance. (Worthington) --- The figures of the law and predictions afford not satisfaction; only the Messias can bring it to mankind. (Origen) --- <i>They shall all be taught by God,</i> John vi. 45., and Hebrews i. 2. (Haydock) --- <i>Breasts.</i> Hebrew also, \"loves.\" But the former is the primary signification of (Menochius) <i>dodec.</i> Christ, in his divine and human nature, is the source of all our good. His graces are manifested. He instructs and feeds us with the truths contained in Scripture, and in tradition, (Haydock) or in the Old and New Testament. (Ven. Bede, &c.) --- Spiritual delights are to be preferred before all terrestrial ones. From the incarnation of Christ, and sanctification of man, all other graces proceed. (Tirinus) --- At first the spouse speaks to the bridegroom in the third person, to show her respect, though he was certainly present. Her companions attend her. (Calmet) --- <i>Wine.</i> All seem to agree that these words are addressed to the bridegroom: which shews that they must be understood in the mystical sense. (Haydock)"
      v:002:
        - 'SNG:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Ointments.</i> The bosom used to be perfumed. (Athen. xv. 5., and xv. 14.) --- <i>Thy name.</i> Thou thyself. The preaching of the gospel produced a wonderful change in the world, 2 Corinthians ii. 15. (Calmet) --- The Church honours the name of Jesus on the second Sunday after the Epiphany. (A. Butler, p. 130.) (Haydock) --- <i>Thee.</i> The martyrs and Christian virgins are inflamed with divine love.'
      v:003:
        - "SNG:1:3 | 3 | 3-4 | <i>To,</i> &c., is in the Septuagint; but not in Hebrew or Complutensian. (Calmet) --- Grace must draw, and then people will run, John vi. 44., and xii. 32., and Philippians iii. 12. (St. Ambrose) (Bossuet) --- <i>Rooms.</i> Where there is abundance of wine and ointments. The extraordinary favours of heaven are not granted to all, Matthew xiii. 11. (Calmet) --- <i>Righteous.</i> The apostles, and faithful souls, (Haydock) and all who form a right judgment of things, (Menochius) having their thoughts, works, and actions composed. (Tirinus) --- <i>Black.</i> Or brown, ver. 5. (Haydock) --- The Egyptians were of a less fair complexion, and she had been exposed to the sun, ver. 5. (Calmet) --- The synagogue gloried in her advantages; but the Gentiles being chosen by Christ, obtain the palm. (Theodoret) --- Though outwardly afflicted, the Church is inwardly fair. (Worthington) --- <i>Cedar.</i> Or of the Arabs, who dwelt in <i>tents,</i> made of black goat's hair. (Calmet) --- The tents of the eastern kings were equal in magnificence to our palaces. (Bernier, Valle, &c.)"
      v:005:
        - 'SNG:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Altered.</i> Hebrew, "looked upon me," (Protestants) or "darted his rays at me." (Montanus) (Haydock) --- The Church of the Gentiles was quite disfigured before Christ chose it. Persecutors afterwards strove to tarnish its beauty, but in vain. --- <i>Vineyard.</i> My face (Calmet) and person I have not regarded, while I was attentive to serve others. (Haydock) --- Pastors, who are chosen against their will, sometimes pay so much attention to the welfare of their flock, that they neglect their own interior, and fall into small faults, which Christ will know how to excuse and pardon, Ezechiel xxxiii. 2. (St. Bernard, ser. xxx.) (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'SNG:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Liest.</i> Hebrew, "makest thy flock to rest." (Protestants) (Haydock) --- <i>Mid-day.</i> She represents herself and her beloved as guarding flocks, which were usually driven into some shady place during the heat of the day, when the shepherds took their innocent recreations. --- <i>Wander.</i> (Septuagint; Protestants) But marginal note has, "as one that is veiled," which was the mark of a common woman, Genesis xxxviii. 14. The Gentile Church is eager to be guided by the one true Shepherd, and adheres to him with the greatest fervour, (Calmet) during the heat of persecution. (Cassiodorus) --- We ought to imitate the solicitude of the spouse, and hide ourselves under the shadow of the cross when we are tempted, Isaias xxv. 4. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'SNG:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>If.</i> Christ comforts his Church. (Worthington) --- He doubts not of her fidelity. (Menochius) --- But the very insinuation, which she had made, causes him to give her this sort of rebuke. God is jealous, Exodus xxxiv. 14. He punishes the smallest faults. The spouse perceives this, and runs towards him. --- <i>Thyself.</i> He who is ignorant of himself, must be so likewise of God, (Calmet) and will be sentenced to feed goats. (St. Jerome, ep. xxii. ad Eustoc.) --- <i>Kids.</i> Which had been detained at home. They will naturally seek their mothers. All creatures will raise the soul to God, Job xii. --- <i>Shepherds.</i> Though in the midst of a perverse generation of idolaters and philosophers, the Church will continue steadfast. (Menochius)'
      v:008:
        - 'SNG:1:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Company.</i> Hebrew, "mare." Such were preferred, as more gentle and swift. Pharao had probably made his son-in-law a present of a magnificent chariot. Theocritus (xviii.) compares the beautiful Helena to a Thessalian horse in a chariot, so that this idea is not low, Genesis xlix. 14., and Osee x. 11. (Calmet) --- <i>Horsemen.</i> Protestants, "horses." (Haydock) --- Hebrew <i>susa.</i> Septuagint {GREEK:START e ippos}η ιπποσ{GREEK:END} means also "cavalry," as well as a mare. The Church has nothing to fear. (Menochius)'
      v:009:
        - 'SNG:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>As,</i> &c. Hebrew, "with rows <i>of jewels,</i> thy neck with chains of gold." (Protestants) --- Septuagint here read like the Vulgate <i>c</i> instead of <i>b</i> before <i>thurim,</i> which signifies chains, (ver. 10.; Haydock) as well as turtles. We cannot say that this bird has cheeks. (Calmet) --- It is an emblem of the Church mourning, and ever true to her beloved, (Origen, &c.) who bestows a variety of graces on different people, 1 Corinthians xii. 4. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'SNG:1:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>While.</i> The Church meditates on his passion and resurrection. (Worthington) --- <i>Repose.</i> Or bed. Thus our Saviour was treated, Matthew xxvi. 7., and Luke vii. 37. (Calmet) --- <i>Odour.</i> The virtues of the Church please him. (Menochius) --- The saints, before and since his coming, pray with all earnestness, Apocalypse v. 8.'
      v:012:
        - "SNG:1:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Abide.</i> Hebrew adds, \"all night.\" Christ remained nine months in the virgin's womb. (Calmet) --- The faithful discover him in both the Testaments, (Haydock) and meditate on his sufferings. Myrrh is a bitter but odoriferous liquor."
      v:013:
        - 'SNG:1:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Cyprus.</i> A shrub with leaves like the olive-tree, and fruit growing in clusters, of a very agreeable smell. See Pliny, [Natural History?] xii. 24. Christ has given us his sacred blood on the cross, and in the blessed Eucharist. (Menochius)'
      v:014:
        - 'SNG:1:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Behold.</i> Christ praiseth his spouse. (Worthington) --- <i>Doves.</i> Sharp-sighted, and reddish, Genesis xlix. 12. The Holy Ghost came upon Christ in the form of a dove, Matthew iii. 16. We must imitate his simplicity, (Matthew x. 16.) and have a pure and single eye, or intention, (Matthew vi. 22.; Calmet) inviolably to please God. (Origen) --- The Church decides matters of controversy, without any mistakes. (Menochius)'
      v:015:
        - 'SNG:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Behold.</i> The spouse makes a return of praise, and thanksgiving for her repose, to Christ. (Worthington) --- The corporal beauty of Solomon or of our Saviour is not fully ascertained; but their inward perfections are often proclaimed. --- <i>Flourishing.</i> Hebrew, "green." Septuagint, "shaded." (Esther i. 5.) --- This bed was the womb of the blessed Virgin [Mary], the cross, or any faithful soul. St. Bernard says it is a monastery, retired and adorned with all virtues. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'SNG:1:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Beams.</i> Prelates. --- <i>Rafters.</i> Virtuous subjects. (Menochius) --- <i>Cypress.</i> The are both odoriferous and incorruptible. The cypress has leaves from top to bottom, and grows not so large as the cedar. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xii. 17.)'

      v:001: 'SNG:1:1 | 1 | 1 | Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth: for thy breasts are better than wine,'
      v:002: SNG:1:2 | 2 | 2 | Smelling sweet of the best ointments. Thy name <i>is as</i> oil poured out; therefore young maidens have loved thee.
      v:003: 'SNG:1:3 | 3 | 3 | Draw me: we will run after thee to the odour of thy ointments. The king hath brought me into his store-rooms: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, remembering thy breasts more than wine: the righteous love thee.'
      v:004: 'SNG:1:4 | 4 | 4 | I am black, but beautiful, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Cedar, as the curtains of Solomon.'
      v:005: 'SNG:1:5 | 5 | 5 | Do not consider me that I am brown, because the sun hath altered my colour: the sons of my mother have fought against me, they have made me the keeper in the vineyards: my vineyard I have not kept.'
      v:006: 'SNG:1:6 | 6 | 6 | Shew me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou liest in the mid-day, lest I begin to wander after the flocks of thy companions.'
      v:007: 'SNG:1:7 | 7 | 7 | If thou know not thyself, O fairest among women, go forth, and follow after the steps of the flocks, and feed thy kids beside the tents of the shepherds.'
      v:008: "SNG:1:8 | 8 | 8 | To my company of horsemen, in Pharao's chariots, have I likened thee, O my love."
      v:009: "SNG:1:9 | 9 | 9 | Thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtle dove's, thy neck as jewels."

      v:013: 'SNG:1:13 | 13 | 13 | A cluster of cyprus my love is to me, in the vineyards of Engaddi.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'SNG:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>I am.</i> The spouse compares herself to a lily, as she is the fairest flower on the bed, (Calmet) or Christ may here speak. (Worthington) (Isaias xi. 1.) (Origen) --- He praises himself first, that his spouse may hear her own eulogy. (Menochius)'
      v:002:
        - 'SNG:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Thorns.</i> The bridegroom enhances the praise of his spouse. The Church, surrounded by infidels and persecutors, maintains her beauty and station. Heretics, &c., are no better than thorns. (Origen) (Calmet) --- The Church excels all other societies. In her communion the innocent are preferred before sinners, and among the former, the blessed Virgin [Mary] surpasses all.'
      v:003:
        - 'SNG:2:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>As.</i> The Church praises Christ, resting secure under his protection. (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - 'SNG:2:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Cellar.</i> This was not under ground. Homer (Odyssey b. 237.) places the wine near the nuptial bed. (Calmet) --- <i>In me.</i> Hebrew, "he brought me to the banquetting-house, and his banner over me <i>was</i> love." (Protestants) (Haydock) --- He has shewn me the greatest tenderness. Only the religion of Christ lays before us our duties to God, to ourselves, and neighbours. (Calmet) (St. Thomas Aquinas, ii. 2. q. 26.) (Haydock) --- The holy Spirit came on the assembled disciples, who were deemed to be drunk, and Christ nourishes the pious soul with the wine of his own blood. (Menochius)'
      v:005:
        - 'SNG:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Flowers.</i> Hebrew, "bottles." --- <i>Languish.</i> Septuagint, "am wounded." (Haydock) --- Those who enter upon the paths of virtue, are often deprived of consolations. (Calmet) --- They must support themselves by reflecting on the words and sufferings of Christ. (St. Ambrose, psalm cxviii. ser. 5.) (Bossuet)'
      v:006:
        - 'SNG:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Hand.</i> After peace comes affliction: grace is followed by glory, Proverbs iii. 16. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'SNG:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>I.</i> Christ permits not his Church to be persecuted, till she be able to bear it. (Worthington) --- <i>Roes.</i> Septuagint, "armies and power;" the angels and apostles, who have spread the gospel through the world. It would seem that the Jewish women loved hunting, (Calmet) like those of Phœnicia and Lacedæmon. (Virgil, Æneid i.) They were going to sing, (Calmet) the morning epithalamium, (Theocrit. xviii.) after the first night of the marriage. The second meeting takes place, ver. 8, 17. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - "SNG:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>The.</i> Feeling the protection of Christ, the Church preacheth boldly the truth against pagans and heretics. (Worthington) --- She knows the voice of the shepherd, (John viii. 47., and x. 2.) and keeps at a distance the wolves in sheep's clothing, or pretended reformers, who would scatter the flock. --- <i>Hills.</i> She sees him returning in the evening with the utmost speed of a stag, as the Hebrew implies, chap. ii. 9., and viii. 14."
      v:009:
        - 'SNG:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Hart,</i> (Proverbs v. 18.) which is swifter that the dogs. (Xenophon, Cuneg.) --- This animal is said to destroy serpents, as Christ did the power of the devil. (Theodoret) --- <i>Wall.</i> Under the old law, Christ was only seen in figure. He manifested himself in the new. Yet our sins separate him from us, Isaias lix. 2. He is concealed in the sacred mysteries, (Calmet) and his humanity keeps from our sight the glory of his divinity, which alone can impart full content. (St. Ambrose; St. Bernard) --- He shewed a glimpse of it at his transfiguration, and by his miracles. (Menochius)'
      v:010:
        - 'SNG:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Arise.</i> He sings under the window, to ver. 16. --- <i>My dove,</i> is taken from the Septuagint. (Calmet) --- Christ invites his spouse to approach, though he shews not himself as yet; and orders his pastors to root out heresies, ver. 25. (Worthington) --- She is ever faithful, and rejoices in him, 2 Corinthians xi. 2., Matthew ix. 15., and Ephesians v. 26. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'SNG:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Winter.</i> The rigour and darkness of the old law give place to that of light and love. (Origen) --- After persecution had ceased, pruning became more necessary. (Calmet) --- The Israelites and the world were redeemed in spring, and the ceremonies of the law were abolished at the same season. (Menochius)'
      v:012:
        - 'SNG:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Pruning.</i> Protestants, "singing <i>of birds.</i>" (Haydock) --- But the former version is better. (Septuagint, Symmachus, &c.) --- <i>Turtle.</i> Which returns in spring, Isaias viii. 9. (Calmet) --- It denotes the preaching of the gospel, (St. Cyril, ador. 15.) or rather the sighs of a holy soul in exile.'
      v:014:
        - 'SNG:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Rock.</i> Wild pigeons retire thither. (Varro, iii. 7.) {GREEK:START Koilen eiseptato petren}Κοιλην ηισηπτατο πητρην{GREEK:END}. (Il. 20. Ser. xlviii. 28.) (Calmet) --- Holy souls seek protection in the wounds of their Saviour. (St. Gregory; St. Bernard, ser. lxi.) --- <i>Wall.</i> In the holy Scriptures, which defend the Church. She is brought to light for the edification of all. (Menochius)'
      v:015:
        - 'SNG:2:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Foxes.</i> They hurt vines, (Theoc. 5.) and denote false prophets, Ezechiel xiii. 4. (St. Augustine) (Psalm lxxx.) --- <i>For.</i> Hebrew, "and our vines of Semadar," ver. 13. (Calmet) --- Foxes breed in spring, and greatly infested the country, Judges xv. 4.'
      v:016:
        - 'SNG:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Feedeth.</i> "His flock." (Septuagint) He still retains the fragrancy of lilies. As married people are two in one flesh, (Ephesians v. 31.) Christ and his Church are irrevocably united. (Calmet) --- She reposes in him. (Worthington)'
      v:017:
        - 'SNG:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Break.</i> Or "yield <i>a refreshing</i> air," (<i>aspiret</i>) in the morning, (Haydock) and evening, when she begs he will return, (Theodoret) as she could not enjoy his company in the day-time, chap. i. 1., and iv. 6. --- <i>Bether.</i> Or the lower Bethoron, near Jerusalem. These short visits in the night, shew the vicissitudes of comfort and dryness in the most perfect. Those who are still addicted to their passions, and to the world, can have no pretensions to such favours, which amply repay any passing desolation. (St. Bernard, ser. lxxiv.) (Calmet)'

(St. Bernard; St. Anselm, &c.) --- Bethsabee might live to see the marriage of her son, who owed the crown to her, 3 Kings i. 18., and Proverbs iv. 3. Both the parties were crowned, (Isaias lxi. 10.) and no doubt Solomon would display his usual magnificence. The diadem was a bandage, adorned with embroidery, and precious stones. (Calmet)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "SNG:4:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>How.</i> Christ again praises the beauty of his Church. (Worthington) --- The dialogue takes place in the country. (Haydock) --- From corporal beauty, which is often dangerous, and the portion of the most dissolute, we must raise our minds to spiritual advantages, which the Holy Ghost has here in view. --- <i>Within.</i> St. Ambrose, \"besides thy taciturnity.\" Septuagint, \"silence.\" Rabbins, &c., \"hair.\" Protestants, \"within thy locks.\" But what renders this version of <i>tsammathec</i> (Haydock) suspicious is, that none of the ancients knew of it, and the <i>hair</i> is afterwards specified, chap. vi. 4. Moreover, Isaias, (xlvii. 2.) uses it for (Calmet) \"turpitude,\" (St. Jerome) or the parts which are usually \"covered.\" (Septuagint) (Haydock) --- <i>Si qua latent, meliora putat.</i> ([Ovid?] Met. 1500.) --- <i>All the glory of the king's daughter is within,</i> Psalm xliv. 14. Modesty and silence are the best encomium. (Calmet) --- The Lord praises the intention, occupations and doctrine of the Church, the <i>twins</i> of faith and good works; the preaching of Christ's passion without shame, (ver. 3.) and the administration of the sacraments, which, like the <i>neck,</i> unite the members to their head; so that they become invincible, (ver. 4.) whether they be of Jewish or Gentile extraction, ver. 5. (Worthington) --- <i>Up.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, \"appear.\" Jerusalem was the highest part of the country; (Haydock) and <i>coming up</i> and <i>down</i> often means no more than coming or going, Judges xi. 3., and xv. 11. (Calmet) --- The hair of <i>goats</i> in Lycia was beautifully curled. (Ælian xvi. 30.) --- Women used such false hair. (Martial xii. 45.) --- Though the <i>hair</i> be only an ornament, it is not to be neglected; so the pious Christian will always treat with respect the ceremonies established chiefly for the instruction of the ignorant. (Calmet) --- Those simple and fervent souls, by their numbers, adorn the Church, as hair does the body. (St. Gregory) --- The external and internal perfections of the spouse deserve commendation. (Menochius)"
      v:002:
        - 'SNG:4:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Them.</i> Those who lay aside the old man, and receive baptism, are filled with grace, to bring forth the fruits of virtue. (St. Augustine, Doct. ii. 6.) --- Pastors in particular, must lay aside worldly cares, and attend to their flocks. (Menochius)'
      v:003:
        - 'SNG:4:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Scarlet.</i> Preachers of the gospel (St. Gregory) must speak with elegance, and have their lips dyed with the blood of Christ, and purified with coals from the altar. (Calmet) --- So, if we may use the words of a living critic, who is sometimes accurate, "a commentator ought to study at the foot of his crucifix, and write with ink drawn from the heart of Jesus." (Haydock) --- <i>Pomegranate.</i> Plump and ruddy, representing the purity of the Church, and of virgins, who are its "flower," (St. Cyprian) and bring forth fruits of good works. (St. Augustine, de Virg.)'
      v:004:
        - 'SNG:4:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Bulwarks.</i> Hebrew <i>Thalpiyoth,</i> "at the height of the defiles," probably in Libanus, when David conquered Syria. Thalassar, Thelmela, &c., were such "heights." <i>Bucklers,</i> to be used in case of need, or for ornament. Thus the neck of the spouse was adorned with chains and pearls. The Church is this tower, the pillar of truth, 1 Timothy iii., and Matthew xvi. 18. Apostles and prelates are her bucklers.'
      v:005:
        - 'SNG:4:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Roes.</i> This comparison does not seem happy: but exactitude is not required. (Calmet) --- Indeed if we were to take all in the literal sense, a very grotesque figure would arise, with a head like Carmel, a nose like a tower, &c., which shews that the tropological or allegorical sense must be adopted. (Du Hamel) --- The two Testaments given for our instruction, (chap. i. 2.) or the charity towards God and our neighbour, may be meant. (Theodoret)'
      v:006:
        - 'SNG:4:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Retire.</i> In the morning, (Sanctius) or rather the bridegroom takes his leave early, promising to return in the evening, chap. ii. 17. (Calmet) --- <i>Myrrh.</i> To Calvary, where the fervent will pour forth their prayers, and learn mortification. (Calmet) --- Christ dwells in mortified and devout minds.'
      v:007:
        - 'SNG:4:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Thee.</i> All must be pure before they enter heaven, as the blessed Virgin [Mary] was on earth, (Worthington) and the Church is still, Ephesians v. 27. (Calmet) --- Before his departure, Christ heaps praises on her.'
      v:008:
        - 'SNG:4:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Thou.</i> Hebrew, "look from." --- <i>Libanus.</i> So Jerusalem is called, Zacharias xi. 3. (Ribera) (Menochius) --- <i>Amana.</i> Septuagint, "faith." By it and charity, we must do good. (St. Augustine, Psalm lxvii.) Amanus separates Cilicia from Syria. --- <i>Sanir</i> is the name given by the Phenicians to Hermon, (Eusebius) beyond the Jordan, 1 Paralipomenon v. 23. --- <i>Leopards.</i> It is not fit for women to hunt such beasts. Ovid (Met. x. 10.) thus speaks of Venus: <i>Nuda genu, vestemque ritu succincta Dianæ,</i> &c. The Church leaves Jerusalem to preach the gospel without fear. (Menochius)'
      v:009:
        - 'SNG:4:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Wounded.</i> Symmachus, "given." Septuagint, Protestants, "ravished." Mystic writers suppose, that the spouse had been guilty of some negligence; or, on the contrary, that her deportment was most enchanting, bent on God, and on good works. (Calmet) --- <i>Sister.</i> So Assuerus styles himself brother of Esther, xv. 12. Christ died for the unity of his Church. (Menochius)'
      v:010:
        - 'SNG:4:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Spices.</i> He returns her compliment, chap. i. 2.'
      v:011:
        - 'SNG:4:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Lips.</i> Teachers who accommodate their instructions to the capacity of their audience, (Calmet) giving <i>milk</i> to children, Hebrews v. 13., (Haydock) and 1 Corinthians iii. 2. --- In allusion, perhaps, to this passage, (Calmet) it was customary to give milk and honey to the new baptized. (Tertullian, coron.) --- <i>Garments.</i> Which were perfumed, (Genesis xxvii. 17., and Psalm xliv. 9.) and imply good works, (2 Corinthians v. 3., and Romans xiii. 14.; Calmet) and the external service and prayers of the Church, which ascend like incense, Psalm cxl. 2. (Menochius)'
      v:012:
        - 'SNG:4:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Up.</i> She is perfectly chaste, Proverbs v. 14. The Church excludes from her society all unbelievers and schismatics. The wicked serve to exercise the virtuous. Her pastors explain the Scriptures, the fountains of saving knowledge. (Calmet) --- Christ is also a fountain, Zacharias xiii. 1., and John vii. 37. (Menochius)'
      v:013:
        - 'SNG:4:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Plants.</i> The various orders of clergy and laity. --- <i>Cyprus,</i> (chap. i. 13.; Calmet) whence a healing oil is extracted. (Theodoret) --- Protestants, "camphire." (Haydock) --- <i>Spikenard</i> is twice mentioned, as it may be well mixed with cyprus and saffron. (Menochius)'
      v:014:
        - 'SNG:4:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Cinnamon.</i> Very rare, Exodus xxx. 23. --- <i>Libanus,</i> or "incense." (Hebrew)'
      v:015:
        - 'SNG:4:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Libanus.</i> The law of the gospel was proclaimed by the apostles, who were Jews. They explained the pure doctrine of the Scriptures, and converted many.'
      v:016:
        - 'SNG:4:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Wind.</i> At different times. Let all nations be convinced of thy beauty. (Calmet) --- The holy Spirit enabled the apostles to convert the world. (Nys. Rupert.) --- All temptations, whether proceeding from cruelty or deceit, "make constant souls more grateful to God." (Worthington)'

        - "SNG:5:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Apple-trees.</i> The spouse, submitting to God's will, is content to suffer. (Worthington) --- She addresses her beloved, and as he had praised her, under the similitude of a delightful garden, she invites him into it. (Calmet) --- <i>I,</i> &c. Christ again approves of her patience, and invites the saints to congratulate with her. (Worthington) --- He always hears his Church, Matthew xxviii. 20., and Mark xi. 24. (Calmet) --- The saints had prayed for Christ's coming; and accordingly, (Isaias lviii. 9.) he takes flesh of the most pure virgin. (St. Athanasius, Synop.) --- <i>Comb.</i> Septuagint, \"bread.\" --- <i>Milk.</i> Chaldean, \"white wine.\" But (Calmet) milk and wine may be taken together. (Clem. Pæd. i. 6.) --- The chaste delights of retired and penitent souls are thus described: (Calmet) <i>Dulciores sunt lacrymæ orantium quam gaudia theatrorum.</i> (St. Augustine, Psalm cxxviii.\" \"The tears of penitents are the wine of angels, because in them is the odour of life.\" (St. Bernard, ser. 30.) --- <i>Inebriated.</i> Not so as to lose reason, Genesis xliii. 34. (Calmet) --- Protestants marginal note, \"be drunk <i>with</i> loves.\" (Haydock) (Proverbs v. 19., and vii. 18.) This <i>wine</i> of love, is the blessed Eucharist, <i>which maketh virgins to spring forth,</i> (Zacharias ix. 17.) and is a foretaste of heaven, Psalm xxxv. 9. It makes us forget the old man, (Calmet) and raises the mind to God. (St. Cyprian, ep. 63.) --- To this feast Christ invites his disciples, Matthew xxvi., and 1 Corinthians xi. (Menochius) --- <i>Myrrh.</i> Implies that they must be mortified. (Haydock)"
      v:002:

(Calmet) --- She wished to meditate, but is called upon to assist others, and excited by Christ's own example. (Worthington) --- <i>Dew.</i> Having been out in the evening, preceding this fourth night. This denotes imperfect Christians, who remain, indeed, attached to the head, but are a disgrace to it, by their scandalous lives. (St. Augustine, tr. 57 in John) (St. Gregory) (Calmet) --- Such was the state of many in the days of Luther, who accordingly joined the first reformers. See Philips's Life of Card. Pole. p. 364. (Haydock) --- <i>Nights.</i> Anacreon (ode 1.) has something similar. Christ knocks by his inspirations and chastisements, and he is better heard in the <i>night</i> of tribulation, Apocalypse iii. 20. (Calmet) --- Heretics began to blaspheme Christ, after the Church had only enjoyed a short peace, (Menochius) after the ten persecutions."

(Calmet) --- <i>Sapphires.</i> His belt or garment is thus ornamented.

        - 'SNG:6:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Lilies.</i> The church teaches, that God is delighted with the pious desires and works of the faithful. (Worthington) --- She answers the question which had been put to her. (Calmet) --- God associates lilies, or the perfect, to his angels. He "feeds his flock," and "is fed," on works of piety, as Hebrew and Septuagint imply both. (Menochius)'
      v:002:
        - 'SNG:6:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Beloved.</i> She speaks thus, when she finds him, and runs to his embraces, having found what trouble her neglect had occasioned. (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'SNG:6:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Thou.</i> Christ again commends his Church, which is well composed of distinct orders, some governing, others retired from the world, and the rest exercising works of mercy, amid its troubles, who altogether form a complete army, terrible to all her enemies. (Worthington) --- <i>Jerusalem.</i> Which was then one of the finest cities in the east. (Calmet) The Catholic Church resembles the heavenly Jerusalem. (Theodoret) --- <i>Terrible.</i> So great is the power of love, (Romans viii. 35.) in the martyrs, and of the Church, against infidels! (Calmet) --- She is lovely to Christ, and terrible to the wicked. Even her spouse is wounded by her glance. (Menochius)'
      v:004:
        - "SNG:6:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Turn.</i> The more one contemplates God's majesty, the more he will be convinced that it is incomprehensible. (Worthington) --- To pry into mysteries, may cause Christ to retire. (Theodoret, &c.)"
      v:007:
        - 'SNG:6:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Number.</i> The true pastors are numerous, but hirelings more so. The faithful are innumerable, and all are united in the same faith. (Worthington) --- The spouse and the <i>queens</i> represent the more prefect; the <i>concubines,</i> or wives of inferior degree, those who are led by fear; and the <i>maidens,</i> such as are languid and negligent. (Origen) --- The Roman Church is at the head of all metropolitan, episcopal, and parochial Churches. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'SNG:6:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Who.</i> The companions of the spouse, (Calmet) or the synagogue, admire the Christian Church. (Worthington) --- <i>Morning.</i> Aurora. The Church dissipated the darkness of paganism; she appeared as the moon under persecution, and as the sun, after the conversion of Constantine. (Calmet) --- The like will happen in the days of antichrist. (Ven. Bede) --- The religion of the patriarchs may be compared to the morning-star: that of Moses, to the moon; and of Christ, to the sun. (Menochius)'
      v:011:
        - "SNG:6:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Aminadab.</i> The devil, (Theodoret) or probably some renowned general. Aquila explains it \"of the people's leader,\" (Calmet) or \"munificent one.\" (Montanus) --- I knew not what forced me to flee with such speed, as if I had been panic-struck, (Calmet) or the spouse professes that she knew not that he had retired into the garden of nuts, or she would not have been under apprehensions of his being ill-treated by Aminadab, as Christ was by Pilate. (Menochius)"

      v:009:
        - 'SNG:7:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Lips.</i> Septuagint, "sufficient for my lips and teeth." (Haydock) --- The wine in that country was very thick, when kept a long time. It here denotes charity, or the gospel truths, Luke v. 37., and Acts ii. 13. Hebrew, "causing the lips of them who sleep to speak," (Calmet) as the apostles did, in transports of zeal. (Theodoret) --- Yet the reading of the Septuagint, Aquila, &c., seems preferable. (Calmet)'

Nectar was of this description, (Calmet) being composed of wine, honey, and odoriferous flowers. The best was made at Babylon. (Athen. i. 25., and ii. 2.) --- These liquors intimate all the virtues, which Christ has taught; the practice of which affords him the greatest satisfaction, John xiv. 23. They are best learnt in retirement, (Calmet) and from our great <i>teacher,</i> Micheas iv. 2. (Menochius)'

The Jews would put this in the mouth of the spouse. (Calmet) --- <i>Corrupted.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "fell in labour, there she was delivered who bore thee." (Haydock) --- Christ redeemed Eve, who had been seduced to eat the forbidden fruit, and by his sacred blood on the cross, awoke and healed our fallen nature. (Calmet) --- The court of heaven admires the Church of the Gentiles, and every pious soul ascending from this world, particularly the blessed Virgin [Mary]. The synagogue was corrupt, when she called for the death of the Son of God, and said, <i>His blood be upon us,</i> &c.

        - 'SNG:8:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Cedar.</i> Procuring for her a rich and steady husband to protect her. These are the words of the bridegroom. The Christian Church seemed weak at first. But her pastors and martyrs caused her to triumph over all the powers of hell. (Calmet) --- Those who correspond with the first grace, are furnished with others. (Menochius)'
      v:011:
        - "SNG:8:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>The.</i> The bridegroom, in the character of a countryman, asserts that he would not give his vineyard or spouse (Calmet) for all the king's riches."

        - 'SNG:8:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Before me.</i> I am satisfied with my spouse. --- <i>The peaceable.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "Solomon." (Haydock) --- Retain them, and also pay the keepers their wages. I envy not all the treasures of the world; nor would put them in competition with my vineyard, or spouse. The synagogue of Moses and Solomon degenerated, while the Church of Christ has continued faithful, and has always some good workmen. (St. Gregory; Ven. Bede, &c.) (Calmet)'

Amen. (Worthington) --- <i>Flee</i> to heaven, and draw me with thee, chap. i. 4. (Menochius)"

  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "This book is called the <i>Canticle of Canticles,</i> that is to say, the most excellent of all canticles: because it is full of high mysteries, relating to the happy union of Christ and his spouse; which is here begun by love; and is to be eternal in heaven. The <i>spouse</i> of Christ is the Church: more especially as to the happiest part of it, viz., perfect souls, every one of which is his beloved; but above all others, the immaculate and ever blessed Virgin mother [Mary]. (Challoner) --- The bridegroom is Christ, as God and man. His praises and those of his spouse are recorded by various speakers. Solomon has given us three works; for beginners, the more advanced, and the perfect; as the philosophers teach ethics, physics, and metaphysics. All the holy Scriptures contain spiritual food, but they are not all fit for every person, Hebrews v. 13. With what humility ought we not, therefore, to read this most perfect and mystical canticle, as the sentiments of spiritual love are expressed in the same words as that of worldlings, and we are more inclined to follow our own judgment and carnal notions! (Worthington) --- None, therefore, should dare to peruse this work, who has not mastered his passions, having his <i>conversation in heaven.</i> (Haydock) --- The Jews would not allow any to read it before the age of thirty. (Origen and St. Jerome) --- Some of the fathers and commentators have even asserted that the mystical sense is the only one which pertains to this book, (Theodoret; Durham; Tirinus) and it is certainly the true and principal one, though allusion may be made to the marriage of Solomon with Pharao's daughter, (Calmet; Bossuet; Du Hamel) or with a Tyrian princess, (chap. iv. 8., and 3 Kings xiii. 5.) or with Abisag. (Rabbins) --- Grotius shews the corruption of his own heart in his impure comments, as Theodorus, of Mopsuesta, is blamed by the second Council of Const.[Constantinople?] iv. a. 68. The name of <i>God</i> never, indeed, occurs; as he is represented under the idea of the bridegroom, &c., and the piece is allegorical. It might be divided into seven scenes, or <i>nights,</i> as the marriage feast lasted so long, Genesis xxix. 22. During this time the bridegroom saw his spouse seldom, and with great reserve, (Calmet) as was the custom with the Lacedemonians. (Plut.[Plutarch?] in Lyc.) --- We might also refer all to six nights, or to the six ages of the Church, conformably to the system of De la Chetardie and Bishop Walmesley on the Apocalypse. --- <b>I.</b> Age. Chap i. 2., marks the ascension of Christ, and the propagation of Christianity; ver. 4, 5., persecutions; ver. 6, 7., vocation of the Gentiles; ver. 12., protection granted by Christ. <b>II.</b> Chap. ii. 3., peace under Constantine; ver. 11, 17., troubles excited by Arius. <b>III.</b> Chap. iii. 1., irruption of barbarians; ver. 4., does not overturn the Church; ver. 6., they are converted; ver. 11., and Christ is more glorified, as [in] Apocalypse xix. <b>IV.</b> Chap. iv. 5., the Latin and Greek Churches; ver. 8., the Chaldeans, <i>lions,</i> and Greeks, <i>leopards,</i> (Daniel) are converted; the Turks obtain dominion; ver. 12., the Greek schismatics cut off: ver. 16., the Church is persecuted, but protected. <b>V.</b> Chap. v. 2., <i>Dew</i> marks the cooling of charity, (St. Augustine) when Luther appeared; chap. vi. 3., yet the Church triumphs, particularly after the Council of Trent. <b>VI.</b> Chap. vi. 9., after the sounding of the sixth trumpet, the Jews are converted, and adorn the Church, in spite of antichrist's power; ver. 11., she addresses the synagogue, ver. 12. Chap. viii. 2., obtains leave to go into the house of her mother, as the apostles were of Jewish extraction; ver. 7., the constancy of the martyrs appears; (see Rondet.) ver. 8-14., the Church pants for her speedy union with her beloved. We may justly admire her authority, in preserving this and the former work in the canon, notwithstanding the internal and external evidence, and the ill use made of them by infidels, which seemed to militate against them. The Protestant Chateillon styles this \"a wicked book.\" Several passages may, no doubt, be abused by a corrupt heart: but what is there so holy, which may not be perverted? When we meditate on this canticle, we ought to remember the admonition given by the Church in the Mass: \"Let hearts be on high;\" and Oh! that all might answer with truth: \"We have them to the Lord!\""
