      v:001:
        - 'DEU:1:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Beyond.</i> The eastern side of <i>the Jordan</i> is so called in Scripture, with reference to the promised land. (Menochius) --- Hebrew may mean also, "on this side, <i>or</i> at the passage" about <i>Bethabara,</i> "the house of passage," near which the Hebrews were encamped, and where Josue probably crossed over the Jordan, as it was the usual ford. Calmet seems to think that these two first verses have been inverted by Esdras, &c., or interpolated, as he says Moses never crossed the Jordan, and certainly addressed the Hebrews near that river, at a great distance from the Red Sea: but the text does not assert the contrary. It only determines that the place where he harangued them, was a part of the wilderness, or the plains of Moab, <i>over-against the Red Sea,</i> which they had left when they came from Asiongaber, unless the term <i>Suph,</i> which signifies <i>red,</i> may be a proper name of the station Supha, near the torrent Zared, (Numbers xxi. 14,) as Calmet maintains. If this be admitted, this difficulty vanishes, for the camp of Israel was certainly <i>over-against,</i> and not even remote from this place. The other cities may have been in the environs, or Moses may have referred to the stations and places in the desert of Pharan, at Tophel, <i>Laban,</i> or Lebna, <i>Haseroth,</i> (Numbers xxxiii. 17,) <i>where there is very much gold,</i> (Septuagint, "gold mines;" Hebrew, "<i>dizahab,"</i>) and Cades-barne. Lebna, Haseroth, and Cades-barne, were in the territory of the Idumeans, who dwelt to the south-west of the plains of Moab. Tophel and Dizahab are unknown (Calmet) as well as Laban, Haseroth, and Pharan, if they be not the names of encampments. Geographers vary so much in their descriptions of the road, which the Hebrews followed, and in maps of the adjacent countries, that it is now impossible to decide. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - "DEU:1:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Cades-barne.</i> All the distance between Horeb and the Jordan, by Mount <i>Seir,</i> on the road to Cades-barne, might have been travelled in eleven days' time, being about 300 miles; or the Hebrews were so long in going thither, Numbers xxxiii. 17. (Calmet) --- It was to punish the Israelites for their frequent rebellions, that they were condemned to wander in that wilderness forty years. (Du Hamel) --- They might have entered the promised land, when they first came to Cades-barne, from Mount Horeb, (Numbers xiii. 1, 27,) which, even by the circuitous road of Mount Seir, would not have taken them above eleven days. He mentions this to remind them of their folly. Perhaps all the aforesaid places may have been between Horeb and Cades-barne, as Bonfrere maintains that <i>Laban</i> was in the neighbourhood of Sinai, where Moses first received the law which he is now going to explain. His discourse turns upon the chief occurrences of the forty years' journey; and hence, <i>these are the words,</i> (ver. 1,) may refer not only to what he was going to say, but also to the commands which he had already notified to the Israelites, from the passage of the <i>Red Sea</i> till the station Abelsetim, upon the banks of the Jordan, Numbers xxxvi. 13. (Haydock) --- Deuteronomy contains a recapitulation of the law, and therefore it was to be read aloud to all the people on the feast of tabernacles, every seventh year; and the new kings, or rulers of the Hebrews, were commanded to transcribe it, and every day read some part for the rule of their conduct, chap. xvii. 18., and xxxi. 10. (Tirinus)"
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:1:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Month,</i> corresponding with our January, if the ecclesiastical calculation be followed; but if we date from Tisri, this <i>eleventh month</i> will be our July or August. Moses died on the 7th of the following month. (Du Hamel)'
      v:004:
        - 'DEU:1:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Astaroth</i> signifies "sheep," particularly ewes, with their dugs distended with milk. Hence the Sidonians formed the idea of their Astarte, 1 Kings xi. 5. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins say, that Astaroth denotes large mountains, generally covered with sheep. <i>Astaroth-Carnaim,</i> was the city. (Eusebius) --- Here the famous Og resided, though he was defeated at Edrai, as the Hebrew intimates. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:1:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Expound.</i> He begins, as usual, with commemorating the wonders of God, in favour of an ungrateful people. This book may be considered as a supplement to the other four books. (Calmet) --- We need not wonder, therefore, if we find some new observations. The reason why the sabbath is to be kept, is here said to be in the memory of the law being given to the Hebrews, and their liberation from slavery; (chap. v. 15,) whereas in Exodus, it seems to be designed to remind people that God rested on the seventh day. But here is no contradiction. (Watson)'
      v:007:
        - 'DEU:1:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Turn you.</i> The Hebrews, after the passage of the Red Sea, seemed to turn their backs upon the promised land, to go southward. Now, therefore, they are ordered to bend their course to the north, and to enter Chanaan, (Haydock) on the western side of the lake of Sodom, where the <i>Amorrhites</i> dwelt. (Calmet) --- Their <i>mountain,</i> and the other <i>hills,</i> and <i>plains,</i> and <i>vales,</i> (Hebrew <i>sephela,</i> mentioned [in] 1 Machabees xii. 38,) as far as the Nile and the Mediterranean, were the southern limits of the <i>Chanaanites,</i> whose country extended to Libanus. See Numbers xxxiv. (Haydock) --- God promises also to deliver the country as far as the <i>Euphrates</i> to the Hebrews, provided they continue faithful to him, chap. xix. 8. As they neglected this condition, they never possessed the whole country, not even that of Chanaan, unmolested. Yet the whole was <i>tributary</i> to them, in the days of David and Solomon. (St. Augustine, q. 21. in Jos.) (Masius) (Tirinus)'
      v:009:
        - 'DEU:1:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>I said,</i> following the advice of Jethro, Exodus xviii. 18.'
      v:015:
        - 'DEU:1:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Who,</i> &c. Hebrew, "and <i>shoterim</i> (<i>officers</i> like our serjeants, designed to publish and execute the sentence of the judges) over <i>or</i> among your tribes." The Persians still call such officers <i>chaters.</i> The Rabbins say, that the shoterim were generally selected from among the Cinites, the descendants of Jethro, 1 Paralipomenon ii. 55. But we find that the Levites were also chosen, 2 Paralipomenon xix. 11. They seem to have had sometimes the authority of judges, princes, or doctors for the <i>instruction</i> of the people, as the Vulgate here expresses it. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'DEU:1:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Respect.</i> Hebrew, "fear." (Menochius) --- Those who judge ought to be quite impartial, and never suffer their sentence to be dictated either by love or by fear. (Haydock) (Ecclesiasticus vii. 6.) --- <i>Of God,</i> to whom you must give an account of your conduct, Wisdom vi. 4. Speak therefore in his name, and imitate his justice and other perfections. See Psalm lxxxi 1. (Calmet) --- If any one absolve an oppressor because he is rich, that judge is guilty of partiality. (Du Hamel) (Isaias i. 23.) --- <i>Hear it,</i> as the supreme judge. (Menochius) --- The people selected such as might be most proper, out of whom Moses made his choice. (Salien) --- An appeal might be made to himself. (Abulensis, q. 11.)'
      v:023:
        - 'DEU:1:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Pleased me.</i> Even Moses was deceived by the appearance of prudence: and God permitted the people to follow the directions of their cowardice, ver. 26, 32. (Chap. ix. 29., and Numbers xiii. 1.) (Calmet)'
      v:026:
        - 'DEU:1:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Being.</i> Hebrew, "but rebelled against, irritated, or rendered useless," &c. (Calmet)'
      v:027:
        - 'DEU:1:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Hateth us.</i> Such an opinion, can bring nothing but destruction. (Du Hamel)'
      v:030:
        - 'DEU:1:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>For you.</i> Septuagint, "he will defeat them along with you." For man must do something. (St. Augustine, q. 1.)'
      v:037:
        - 'DEU:1:37 | 37 | 37 | <i>Neither,</i> &c. Hebrew simply, "The Lord was also angry with me on your account," &c. Moses had been so long witness to the rebellions of the Hebrews, that at last he gave way to a certain diffidence, when he was ordered by God to give them water out of the rock. He was afraid the Lord would not bear any longer with their repeated acts of ingratitude, nor work a miracle on this occasion, chap. iii. 26., and Numbers xx. 12. (Haydock) --- He had also consented to the sending of the 12 spies imprudently. (Du Hamel) (Ver. 23.)'
      v:039:
        - 'DEU:1:39 | 39 | 39 | <i>Evil.</i> These words were spoken to by God to the Hebrews, after they had refused to go from Cades-barne, to take immediate possession of the land of Chanaan, and not after Moses had offended at the waters of contradiction, which happened only a short time before his death. (Haydock) --- Those who were not come to the use of reason at the former period, (Menochius) or who had not arrived at 20 years of age, were now permitted to enter. (Haydock)'
      v:040:
        - 'DEU:1:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>Sea.</i> This they deferred complying with for a long time, (ver. 46,) and then they directed their course along Mount Seir, towards the west, and encamped at Hesmona. (Calmet) --- Many years after, they arrived at a different branch of the Red Sea from that which they had crossed, Numbers xxxiii. 30, 35. (Haydock)'
      v:041:
        - 'DEU:1:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Armed.</i> Septuagint, "in crowds." Arabic, "quickly." Syriac, "encouraging one another." Chaldean, "impiously." (Calmet) --- The conduct of these people might seem to authorize all these interpretations. The Hebrew term occurs no where else. (Haydock)'
      v:044:
        - 'DEU:1:44 | 44 | 44 | <i>Bees do.</i> This similitude shews the vivacity, courage, and numbers of those who pursued the Hebrews from Seir to Horma. See Numbers xxi. 3., Psalm cvii. 12., and Isaias vii. 18.'
      v:046:
        - 'DEU:1:46 | 46 | 46 | <i>Time.</i> Hebrew adds, "according to the days that you abode." All the time that the Hebrews spent in that neighbourhood, they remained at Cades-barne. The Rabbins say 38 years; but Moses informs us, that they were so long in coming thence to the torrent of Zared, chap. ii. 14. (Calmet)'

      v:028: 'DEU:1:28 | 28 | 28 | Whither shall we go up? the messengers have terrified our hearts, saying: The multitude is very great, and taller than we: the cities are great, and walled up to the sky, we have seen the sons of the Enacims there.'

      v:042: 'DEU:1:42 | 42 | 42 | The Lord said to me: Say to them: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Go not up, and fight not, for I am not with you: lest you fall before your enemies.'
      v:043: 'DEU:1:43 | 43 | 43 | I spoke, and you hearkened not: but resisting the commandment of the Lord, and swelling with pride, you went up into the mountain.'
      v:044: 'DEU:1:44 | 44 | 44 | And the Amorrhite that dwelt in the mountains, coming out, and meeting you, chased you, as bees do: and made slaughter of you from Seir as far as Horma.'

Being arrived at Cades, they attempted to penetrate into Chanaan, by the road of the spies, but were repulsed. Upon which they asked leave of the Idumeans to pass through their country, lying south of the Dead Sea, but could not obtain permission, and God would not suffer them to force a passage, but ordered them to go round their territories, Numbers xx., and xxi. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:2:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Stir.</i> Hebrew <i>gur,</i> meddle not, wage not war, do not molest, &c. The Idumeans near Mount Hor, afterwards refused the Hebrews a passage, and the necessaries of life, though their brethren in Mount Seir had granted them the latter, while they passed quietly along their borders, ver. 28. See Numbers xx. 21. (Haydock)'

      v:009:
        - 'DEU:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Moabites.</i> They allowed the Hebrews to pass, as the Idumeans had done; (ver. 29,) but they treated them with no particular marks of affection, (chap. xxiii. 3,) nor would they suffer them to go across their country, Judges xi. 17. --- <i>Ar,</i> is sometimes called Rabbah Moab, "the great city of the Moabites," (Josue xiii. 25,) and Areopolis. (Eusebius)'
      v:010:
        - 'DEU:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Emim,</i> signifies "the terrible," or "men of cubits <i>or</i> length." See Numbers xiii. 33. They had been probably ruined in the war of Chodorlahomor, (Genesis xiv. 5,) a little before the birth of Moab. (Calmet) --- But those few who remained, were sufficient to strike the beholders with terror, as they were not inferior to the other giants who were known, since the deluge, of the race of Enac, or of Rapha. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'DEU:2:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Giants.</i> Hebrew <i>Raphaim,</i> which Grotius thinks is a word retained from the primitive language. It sometimes denotes giants, and those who groan in hell, on account of the great iniquity of the Raphaim, Job. xxvi. 5. Og was one of their descendants, and inhabited the same country, which they had occupied in the days of Abraham, chap. iii. 2. (Calmet) --- They lost much of their power in the war of Sodom. Some of them fled into the land of the Philistines, and established themselves there, 1 Kings xxi. 16. As these gigantic nations had been overthrown, as well as the Horrhites, when God formerly gave their territories to Moad and to Esau, (Haydock) so the Hebrews may be assured, that nothing will be able to resist their power, while He is with them. (Menochius)'
      v:012:
        - 'DEU:2:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Gave him,</i> on the east side of the Jordan. They had not yet taken possession of Chanaan. But Moses foresees that they shortly will; and in this sense we may translate, "Esau dwelt there, as Israel will in the land," &c., ver. 29.

(Calmet) --- They had lost possession when the Hebrews came; and, as God had authorized the latter to take the land from those kings, without enquiring who were the former proprietors, the Ammonites, who had themselves expelled the Zomzommim, came with a very bad grace to assert their title, after a lapse of near 300 years. God only forbids the Hebrews to molest the actual dominions of the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Esau, in consideration of their fathers, to whom they were so nearly related. (Haydock)'

        - 'DEU:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Turned.</i> Instead of going straight forward across the Jordan, we directed our arms against Basan, in the north. See Numbers xxi. 33.'
      v:004:
        - 'DEU:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Country.</i> Hebrew, "the line" with which lands were measured, chap. xxxii. 9. --- <i>Argob</i> may signify <i>rich</i> and fertile; "all that fertile region, the kingdom of Og." Vatable thinks that Basan, Argob, and Trachonitis, denote the same country. But Cellarius observes, that the last mentioned country was ill cultivated and very poor, the inhabitants living mostly in the caverns of rocks, whereas Argob or Basan was adorned with 60 <i>cities.</i>'
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:3:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Walls.</i> Tacitus remarks, that "a great part of Judea is covered with villages, though towns may likewise be found in the country. (Hist. v. 8.) See 3 Kings iv. 13. Septuagint, "besides the towns of the Pherezites, which were very numerous." (Calmet) --- The spies had not travelled in this county, when they gave an account of the walled towns being as high as heaven. But Moses here informs us, that the cities on the east side of the Jordan were not much inferior to those on the west, and the land was infested also with <i>giants,</i> ver. 13. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - 'DEU:3:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Utterly.</i> Yet out of the ruins they soon raised other strong cities, Numbers xxxii. 26. All the walls were not probably demolished, (ver. 19,) but only a part, so that they might be repaired with no great labour or expense. The inhabitants were all destroyed, that they might not pervert the Hebrews by their bad example; and because God had pronounced the sentence of death upon them, in punishment of their crimes. Hebrew seems to insinuate, that the cities were destroyed only by the death of the inhabitants. "We subjected them to anathema....utterly destroying the men," &c. (Haydock) --- We devoted to utter ruin the men, women, and children of the cities which we took. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - 'DEU:3:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Beyond.</i> East of the promised land of <i>Chanaan,</i> which the sacred writers have generally in view. (Haydock) --- Hebrew <i>heber,</i> means, "alongside, opposite to, at the passage, on this side," &c. See chap. i. 1., and 3 Kings iv. 24. (Calmet) --- There is no need, therefore, to suppose that this and similar passages have been inserted by a later writer. (Haydock) --- <i>Hermon,</i> which profane authors commonly call Antilibanus, (Calmet) was a part of the range of the <i>mountains of Galaad,</i> by which name it goes frequently, though it be also denominated Seon, or Sion, (chap. iv. 48.; Menochius) and the different nations had other names for it, ver. 9. (Haydock) --- It does not appear that Moses went much beyond the torrent of Jeboc. But he knew that the territory, as far as Hermon and Emath, belonged to the Hebrews, and he probably, sent some troops to take possession of it. They did not, however, entirely banish the Hevites, that <i>dwelt from Baal-Hermon to the entering into Emath.</i> These and some other nations were left by God to <i>instruct Israel,</i> Judges iii. 3.'
      v:010:
        - 'DEU:3:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Plain.</i> Hebrew <i>Mishor,</i> which the Septuagint leave untranslated. It has perhaps the same meaning as Argob, ver. 4. (Calmet)'
      v:011:
        - 'DEU:3:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Giants.</i> Hebrew, "Raphaim." Og was the only survivor of this family, in Basan, though there were other giants dispersed throughout the land, 1 Paralipomenon xx. 6. (Tirinus) --- Some of the <i>stock of Rapha,</i> were also seen afterwards at Geth, but they did not reign in the country of their fathers, as Og alone did at this time, Josue xv. 14., and xvii. 15. Hebrew may be, "Now Og, king of Basan, was a remnant of the Raphaim." (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "for, moreover, Og....was left of the Raphaim." <i>His bed</i> was 13½ feet long, and 6½ broad, taking the cubit at 18 inches, with Arbuthnot; though Calmet allows 20½ French inches, which are greater than ours. As beds are commonly made larger than the person who lies in them, he concludes that Og might be 14 or 15 feet high, unless he was possessed with the same vanity as Alexander the Great, who caused beds five cubits long to be left in his camp, when he returned from his Indian expedition, in order that the people might think that his soldiers were of a gigantic stature. Allowances must here be made for a royal bed; and, at any rate, it will not easily be proved that a human body might not exceed 12 or 15 feet in height, without injuring the just proportions, as Thomas Paine would have us to believe. We know that the difference in size between the inhabitants of Shetland and of Patagonia is still very great; and the people of the former island would act very irrationally, if they would not credit the existence of the Lincolnshire ox, or of the large dray horses in London, because their own oxen are not bigger than mastiffs. See Watson, p. 26. --- <i>Iron.</i> Bedsteads are frequently made of iron, brass, silver, or gold, in hot countries, for the sake of cleanliness and grandeur, Proverbs xxv. 11., Esther i. 6. The Parthian kings reserved to themselves the privilege of lying on golden beds. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xx. 20.) The Thebans made beds of iron and brass out of the spoils of Platea, and consecrated them to Juno. (Thucydides, iii.) --- <i>Ammon.</i> Hebrew, "Behold his bedstead was of iron; is it not in Rabbath?" &c. This town is called Rabbatamana, by Polybius; and Ammana, by Eusebius, who says it had afterwards the name of Astarte, till Ptolemy Philadelphus gave it the title of Philadelphia. It lay to the east of Jazer, not far from the Arnon. (Cellarius, iii. 14.) It is probable that the bed of Og continued in this city, till it was taken by David, 2 Kings xxii. 30. How the Ammonites got possession of it, we do not know. It seems that the account of it, and of Jair, (ver. 15,) have been given by some one who lived a long time after these events had taken place. (Calmet) --- This conjecture, however, is not well founded, for though Moses was addressing those who had been witnesses to these transactions not many months before, his appeal to them gives the strongest authority to a narration, which was to be handed down to the latest posterity. They could attest the surprising stature of that giant, whom they had slain, and their neighbours kept his bed as a proof of his having existed, the terror of all that country. <i>Until this present day,</i> (ver. 14,) is an expression often used in Scripture, to denote an event which had taken place at no very great distance of time, chap. xi. 4. Thus St. Matthew, (xxvii. 8,) writing about eight years after the ascension of our Saviour, says, the <i>field was called Haceldama....even to this day.</i> See Josue viii. 29. (Haydock) --- It is sufficient if the thing be still in the same state as it was before. (Menochius) --- <i>Hand.</i> Hebrew, "according to the cubit of a man," from the elbow to the finger ends. (Calmet) --- Syriac, "of giants." Chaldean, "of the king;" whence some have imagined, that the bed was nine times as long as the cubit of Og, which is very improbable. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins, who delight in fables, say that this bed was used by Og only while he was in his infancy: for he grew to be 120 cubits high; and some say his foot alone was this length. He would have hurled a mountain to overwhelm all the Hebrews at once, only a bird, or some ants, made a hole in it, and the mountain falling upon his shoulders, he could not extricate his head, God causing his teeth to grow ten cubits, and in this condition he was taken and killed by Moses. (Lyranus, &c.) --- Noble discovery of these blind guides! (Calmet) --- The poets have not been more extravagant in their descriptions of Typheus, or Typho, whose name signifies <i>burning,</i> as well as that of Og, (or <i>hóg,</i> he burnt) with whom he has probably been confounded. (Vossius on Idolat.) (Haydock)'

The two tribes of Gad and Ruben, occupied the territory lying between the Jeboc and the Arnon, hemmed in by the mountains of Galaad, on the east, and by the Jordan and the most salt sea, and that of Cenereth, on the west. Gad occupied the northern division of this country. (Haydock)'

        - "DEU:3:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>I will.</i> Moses flattered himself, that God's refusal to let him cross the Jordan, was only conditional; and therefore he begs, with all humility, for leave to enter Chanaan, at the head of the people. But, though God had pardoned his fault, he would not deprive Josue of the honour, which to fulfil the mystery, was reserved for him, Numbers xx. 12., and xxvi. 64. (Calmet) --- Moses might very lawfully desire to behold a place, consecrated by the abode of the Patriarchs, and to be honoured still more by the presence of the Messias, a happiness for which he had been labouring now forty years. (Du Hamel) --- <i>And Libanus.</i> Whether this <i>and</i> be an explanation of what mountain he meant, (Tirinus) is a matter of doubt. He unquestionably desired to see, and to put his people in possession of all the country designed for their inheritance, in which various fruitful mountains appeared. That of Bethel was very high, and most delightful where Abraham and Jacob had dwelt. Moria and Sion, the future seat of the temple, might also attract his notice, and the mountains of Judea, as well as all the other lofty hills, which diversify the country from Idumea to Libanus. (Haydock) --- Egypt was a flat country. New and grander prospects now open to his view. Libanus is styled Antilibanus by the Septuatint, and by profane authors, as it lies, in effect, to the land of the Hebrews. Behind it Cœlostria extends, as far as Libanus. This mountain comprises four different hills, rising one above another, and taking in a circuit of 300 miles. The first of these hills, Antilibanus, is remarkable for its fertility in corn; the second has abundance of fine springs: but the third resembles an earthly paradise, being constantly adorned with fruits and flowers. Cedars grow chiefly upon the fourth, amidst the snows which lie there perpetually, notwithstanding the burning heats of the adjacent countries. <i>Lebanon</i> signifies both \"whiteness and incense,\" for which it is very renowned. (Calmet) --- De la Roque thinks that it is higher than the Alps or Pyrenees. It stands in the form of a horse-shoe, extending from above Smyrna to Sidon, and thence towards Damascus, (Buffon) unless this be a part of Antilibanus, which runs north, from Damascus, in a parallel direction to Libanus, and includes the hollow Syria. (Haydock) --- Serarius makes these two mountains run eastward, almost from the Mediterranean sea, as Strabo (xvi.) and Ptolemy seem also to do. (Bonfrere)"
      v:026:
        - 'DEU:3:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Your account.</i> Moses cannot help reminding the people, that they were the occasion of his giving way to diffidence, and thus incurring a most sensible chastisement from the hands of God. Their conduct had provoked him so, that he gave some outward signs of the trouble with which his mind was so much disturbed, chap. xx. 12. Yet God admits of no excuse, particularly in the sins of those who act in his name, and who, of course, ought to guard against the smallest deviation from virtue. <i>Be ye holy and perfect,</i> is addressed to such in a particular manner. (Haydock)'
      v:027:
        - 'DEU:3:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>East.</i> It seems, if Phasga was the eastern boundary of Ruben, (ver. 17,) there was no occasion for Moses to cast his eyes that way. He is ordered to take a full view of the countries allotted by God to the Hebrews; and if we consider that the territory, as far as the Euphrates, was promised to them, if they would continue to be faithful, and that it was made tributary, under Solomon, we need not wonder if Moses should be pleased to behold it, chap. i. 7.

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'DEU:4:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>And judgments,</i> regarding religion and civil affairs. (Calmet) --- Live a happy life. (Menochius)'
      v:002:
        - 'DEU:4:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Add</i> any thing repugnant to the spirit of my law. No interpretation of this kind can be admitted. But this does not condemn well authorized traditions, and laws enacted by lawful superiors. The Jews always boast of their close adherence to the letter of the law, but they often forget the spirit of it, and by their traditions render it deformed, like a carcass. Demosthenes takes notice, that the Locrians had such a regard for their laws, that if any one chose to propose any fresh ones, he came with a rope about his neck, that if they did not meet with the approbation of the people, he might be strangled immediately. (Calmet) --- Moses cannot mean to forbid any more divine or civil commandments being written by Josue and the subsequent prophets. He only enjoins that nothing shall be altered by human authority. The other books of the Old Testament serve to explain the law; and so do the apostolical traditions (Worthington) afford great assistance to understand the true meaning of all the Scriptures, and hence we learn whatever we have to perform, without danger of being led astray. (Haydock) --- To these the Scriptures frequently refer. <i>He that heareth you, heareth me,</i> Luke x. <i>Hold the traditions which you have learnt,</i> 2 Thessalonians ii. <i>The rest I will set in order, when I come,</i> 1 Corinthians xi. 34. Hence St. Augustine (contra Cresc. i. 33) observes, "Though no evident example can be produced from Scripture, yet we hold the truth of the same Scripture, when we do what meets with the approbation of that Church whose authority the Scripture establishes." See ep. 80, St. Chrysostom in 1 Thess. iv.; St. Irenæus, Against Heresies iii. 4. (Worthington) --- The Jews themselves never had the folly to imagine with the modern innovators, that all laws both of a religous or civil nature were here proscribed. Under David, Mardocheus, and the Machabees, various laws and feasts were commanded, and observed in the true spirit of the law, 1 Kings xxx. 25., and Esther ix., and 1 Machabees iv. God does not leave to the discretion of the Jews, the appointing of different victims, &c., in his worship, (chap. xii. 30,) as they might very easily give way to the superstitious observances of their neighbours, and these things had been sufficiently determined. But he enjoins all to obey the declarations of the priests and judges, chap. xvii. 10. (Bellarmine) (Tirinus) --- Thus when the Apocalypse records a prohibition similar to this, (Apocalypse xxii. 18, 19,) it is not intended to seal up the divine volume, so that nothing more shall be admitted into it, for St. John wrote his gospel afterwards. But it must be explained in the same sense as this passage, and condemns all those who, of their own authority, would set up fresh doctrine in opposition to the word of God. Let Protestants consider if they be not concerned in this caution, when they not only cut off whole books of Scripture, but deny the authority of the Church itself, without which the Scripture can be of little service. They are the book <i>sealed with seven seals,</i> impenetrable to man without the aid of the divine author; (Apocalypse v. 5,) and this aid he will never grant to those who obstinately refuse to <i>hear the Church,</i> Matthew xviii. 17., and 2 Peter i. 20. (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:4:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Among you,</i> when the guilty Israelites and the Madianites were slain, Numbers xxv., and xxxi.'
      v:004:
        - DEU:4:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Day.</i> Not but that many of these had fallen into sin; but they had not abandoned the Lord to worship any idol. (Haydock)
      v:006:
        - 'DEU:4:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>This is</i> a proof of <i>your wisdom,</i> &c., if you observe these commands. Your conduct will excite the admiration of all. (Menochius) --- Solomon often inculcates the same truths, Proverbs i. 7., and Ecclesiasticus i. 34. Even profane writers applauded the laws and fidelity of the Jews. See Josephus, Jewish Wars i. 5.; Strabo xvi. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'DEU:4:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Gods.</i> Supposing they deserved that title, which of them has the power to shew their votaries such favours as the true God hath shewn to us? The idols are nothing but <i>devils,</i> which seek to destroy. (Calmet) --- But God had manifested his power and love to the Hebrews in the most astonishing manner. He seemed to choose his residence among them, in the tabernacle. (Haydock) --- This Jesus does in a still more wonderful manner, with respect to Christians, remaining with them in the sacrament of love. The other sacraments which he has instituted, are more noble and efficacious than those of the old law. He was pleased to take our nature, (Calmet) and to <i>dwell among us,</i> John i. The providence of God pervades all things; and, though all live <i>in Him,</i> (Acts xvii. 28,) yet he shews the marks of the most paternal tenderness to his elect. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'DEU:4:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Eyes.</i> Most of these laws had been already promulgated, so that the people could set a just value upon them. But Moses undertakes to place the in a more beautiful point of view, as it were altogether, and accompanied with some fresh regulations. How imperfect are all the codes of the ancient lawgivers, when compared with this of Moses! (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'DEU:4:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Words.</i> Hebrew also, "things." (Haydock) --- Both sacred and profane authors use the term of <i>seeing,</i> to denote any of the senses, ver. 12. Eschylus (in Prometh.) says, "you shall neither see the form nor the <i>voice</i> of mortals."'
      v:012:
        - 'DEU:4:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>At all.</i> Hebrew, "but saw no similitude, only a voice." See Exodus xx. 18.'
      v:013:
        - 'DEU:4:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Stone.</i> Josephus (Antiquities iii. 4, 6,) says, that each table contained five precepts, two and a half being inscribed on one side. The Jews now suppose that four appeared on one table, and six on the other. But each table probably contained an entire copy of the law. (Calmet) --- It hence appears, that there are just ten precepts. (Worthington) --- But the manner of dividing them is rather uncertain. St. Augustine and Catholics in general, place the three commandments, which regard God, by themselves. See Exodus xx. 1. Their greater importance and length would require as much space as the other seven, which ascertain the mutual duties of people to each other. (Haydock)'
      v:015:
        - 'DEU:4:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Carefully.</i> Hebrew, "Be therefore particularly attentive, as much as you love your own soul." (Vatable) By keeping my commandments, you can alone obtain salvation, ver. 9. (Menochius) --- <i>Similitude</i> of any living creature, such as were the objects of adoration among the pagans. Some represented their gods under the forms of men, women, beasts, birds, or reptiles; while others adored the sun, moon, and stars. (Haydock) --- This last was indeed the most ancient species of idolatry, Job xxi. 26. Baal, Astarte, Moloc, Chamos, &c., were different names by which they denoted the heavenly bodies. But the Egyptians carried their superstition to the greatest excess. There was hardly any sort of animal which did not obtain sovereign worship among them. (Calmet) --- Their great gods, Isis and Osiris, were sometimes depicted like a man and woman; at other times, like beasts, and frequently they appeared with parts of both. The head of Isis was generally adorned or disfigured with the horns of a bull; (Haydock) and that animal, either alive or in a picture, as well as dogs and cats, were adored throughout the country, while some places had their peculiar idols. The lion, the wolf, and the fish called <i>latus,</i> gave their names to the cities Leontopolis, &c., which had a particular veneration for them. Moses takes care to inform the Hebrews, that the true God is like none of these things; and that they cannot pretend to represent him under any such forms, without doing him an injury. (Calmet) --- If Catholics endeavour to put the people in mind of the blessed Trinity, by representing a venerable old man, Jesus Christ in his human nature, and a dove, under which forms the Scripture has introduced the three divine persons, they do not pretend that their divine and most spiritual nature can be thus expressed. "If," says the Council of Trent, Session 25, "the historical accounts of Scripture be sometimes set forth in paintings, for the benefit of the illiterate, let the people be informed that the Divinity is not thus represented, with a design to insinuate that it may be seen with the eyes of the body." So neither can the figure of a triangle, with the ineffable name of God in Hebrew, &c., explain this adorable mystery. But such things may recall to our remembrance, the innumerable benefits which we have received from the three divine persons, after we have been once informed what we have to believe respecting them. This is the laudable motive which has induced the Church to encourage the keeping of such pictures, as well as those of the saints, with due respect. "Not as if we believed that any divinity or virtue resided in them for which they were to be worshipped, or that we should ask any thing of them, or place our confidence in images, as the Gentiles formerly did, who hoped in their idols, (Psalm cxxxiv.,) but because the honour given to them is referred to the originals, which they represent," &c. (Council of Trent, Session 25.) (Haydock)'
      v:019:
        - 'DEU:4:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Service.</i> How then could the nations give way to such stupidity, but because they had forgotten the design of God in creating the heavenly bodies, which Moses therefore takes care to inculcate? (Genesis i. 14.) Hebrew and Septuagint, "which God has divided unto all," &c.; whence some have falsely supposed, that God had tolerated the worship of the stars in other nations. See chap. xxix. 26. (Drusius) (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - 'DEU:4:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Furnace.</i> This expression gives us some idea of the cruelties to which the Hebrews had been exposed, 3 Kings viii. 51. Iron and other metals were melted in furnaces: Hebrew <i>cur,</i> Ezechiel xxii. 20. In the countries of the East, workmen have them in the middle of their shops, and sit round them to work. (Bellon., iii. 45.) (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - 'DEU:4:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Words.</i> The murmurs of the people occasioned the diffidence of Moses, and he often reminds them of it, that they may reflect how severely God will punish them, if they transgress, since he spares not his greatest favourites. (Calmet) --- Even venial faults must be punished. (Worthington)'
      v:023:
        - 'DEU:4:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Made.</i> Hebrew, "and make to thyself a sculpture, the likeness of any thing which the Lord thy God commanded thee." He ordered them to abstain from idolatry. (Du Hamel)'
      v:024:
        - 'DEU:4:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Fire.</i> God often appeared in the midst of fire. <i>All the land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy,</i> Sophonias i. 18., and iii. 8. (Calmet) --- By these expressions, we are exhorted not to do any thing which would excite the indignation of our true lover, nor ever be unfaithful to him. (Haydock) --- The pagans thought that fire was the fittest symbol of the divinity. (Porphyr. de Abstin.)'
      v:026:
        - 'DEU:4:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>And earth,</i> or all their rational inhabitants. (St. Jerome and St. Basil in Isa. i. 2.) Moses conjures the Israelites, by all that is most sacred, to continue faithful. He speaks with the greatest earnestness, as he does again, chap. xxxii. 1. (Calmet) --- He makes use of a sort of oath, by the creatures, in which God shines forth. (Menochius) --- <i>Destroy you.</i> He will take from you that delightful country, though he will save a remnant of you out of the captivity of Babylon, and in the latter days, ver. 31. The Jews, in the promised land, were almost always prone to idolatry; till God severely chastised them by the hands of the Babylonians. Since that time, few of them have willingly yielded to the worship of idols, though some have fallen by compulsion, as we read, Daniel iii., and 1 Machabees i. 53., and ii. 16. Jeremias (v. 19) foretold that this would be the case. <i>As you have forsaken me, and served a strange god in your own land, so shall you serve strangers in a land that is not your own.</i> (Haydock)'
      v:027:
        - 'DEU:4:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Nations.</i> This prediction we see verified at the present day. They are despised by all. No one of their numerous masters embraces their religion. They are so few, as hardly to possess a single town. (Calmet)'
      v:029:
        - 'DEU:4:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>There.</i> Hebrew, "thence" from the place of captivity, or returning from the love of idols to the services of the true God. --- <i>Soul.</i> Hebrew, "with all thy soul. (Ver. 30) In thy tribulation after," &c. (Calmet) --- God often sends chastisements as the most effectual means of salvation, to make his children enter into themselves. In this state, the soul is more at liberty to consider the folly of adhering to any thing in opposition to the sovereign Lord. Then she is forced to confess that her idols cannot afford her any protection. How, in effect, could any one fall into such an abyss of corruption and stupidity, as to imagine those things to be gods which have not even the dignity and advantages which they themselves possess? Their soul must first have been strangely blinded, and their heart corrupt. Even the more enlightened pagans acknowledged the folly of pretending to represent the Divinity under sensible forms. "God, says Empedocles, has no human members....He is a pure and ineffable spirit, who governs the world by his profound wisdom." Numa would not allow any picture of Him, conformably to the doctrine of Pythagoras; and, for the first 170 years of Rome, no representation of God was set up in the temples. (Plutarch) --- The ancient Phœnicians seemed to have acted on the same principle, as the temple of Hercules, at the Straits, had no image. It is well known that the Persians rejected both the statues and temples erected in honour of the gods; and the Germans esteemed it beneath the majesty of the heavenly Beings, to represent them under any human form. (Tacitus, Hist. v.) (Calmet) --- Yet these sages gave way to the folly of the people, and, against their better knowledge, adored the stupid and senseless idols. (Haydock)'
      v:030:
        - 'DEU:4:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Voice,</i> after the captivity of Babylon, or rather at the end of the world. The nation at large has not embraced the worship of idols since the former period. But it will not be perfectly converted, <i>until the fulness of the Gentiles....come in.---And so all Israel....be saved,</i> Romans xi. 25. (Calmet) --- St. Paul terms their present state <i>a blindness in part,</i> because, though few have embraced the revelation of God, made to all by his only Son, the far greater part have obstinately shut their eyes, so that, even while they read the clearest prophecies, they seem to have a <i>veil</i> on then. But, after they shall have been the sport of their passions and errors till the <i>latter time,</i> when <i>the man of sin</i> shall be fully <i>revealed,</i> they will see how wretchedly they have been deluded, and, the grace of God touching their hearts, they will remember the <i>covenant,</i> and embrace Christ, the end of all the law. Happy those who do not defer their conversion till that awful period! (Haydock)'
      v:032:
        - 'DEU:4:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Heaven.</i> To our senses the sky seems to rest upon the horizon. So Jesus says, <i>Then he....shall gather....his elect....from the uttermost part of earth, to the uttermost part of heaven,</i> Matthew xxiv. 31. Vatable translates, "from the east to the west." In no age or place did God ever declare his will, as he had done at Sinai. (Calmet)'
      v:033:
        - 'DEU:4:33 | 33 | 33 | <i>And lived.</i> It was generally supposed, that those who had seen a vision of God, or of his angel, would instantly die. See Genesis xvi. 13. (Haydock) (Chap. v. 24.)'
      v:034:
        - "DEU:4:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Temptations.</i> The Chaldean and Arabic understand this of the prodigies which God wrought in favour of his people; though they may also denote the trials to which the Patriarchs and the Hebrews had been exposed, that their virtue might shine more brightly. Many indeed lost courage under these trials, but they were of great service to form a perfect people; and those who continued to lead a virtuous life, received the reward of their labours. (Calmet) --- <i>Visions,</i> during the three days' darkness mentioned, Wisdom xvii. 9, 18, &c., (Menochius) or those terrible appearances on Sinai, ver. 33, 36., and chap. v. 22. (Calmet) Hebrew may be, \"by great terrors.\" --- <i>In Egypt.</i> God himself fought for his people, when he brought them out of that country. He repeatedly made the king and his people feel the impressions of terror, but as they presently recovered their wonted insolence and pride, he at last miraculously divided the Red Sea, and buried vast multitudes in its waters.

        - 'DEU:4:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Then,</i> &c. This piece of history seems to be placed out of its natural order, by another hand. (Calmet) --- Yet if we attend to the method of Moses, in his other works, we shall not hastily conclude that it is an interpolation. He frequently repeats what has been already specified. He had received an order from God to appoint these three cities of refuge, (Numbers xxxv. 14,) after he had given the land to the tribes of Ruben, &c., Numbers xxxii. This he executes at the conclusion of this discourse; and hence takes occasion to mention how they had taken possession of this country. (Haydock)'

        - 'DEU:5:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>All Israel:</i> not one was wanting, chap. xxix. 10. God enabled all to hear the words of their lawgiver, (Menochius) by an evident miracle. (Jansenius) (Calmet)'
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:5:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Fathers,</i> the ancient patriarchs, who were not favoured in such a signal manner. (Menochius) --- Though many of those who had heard the words of God at Horeb, were dead, and had not enjoyed the full benefit of the covenant, some still remained, and the children of the deceased were about to enter the land which had been there promised. (Haydock) --- God did not make a covenant with the Patriarchs only, but also with their posterity at Horeb. (Du Hamel)'
      v:004:
        - 'DEU:5:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>To us.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "to you." --- <i>Face to face,</i> in such a manner that no doubt could be entertained of his presence. (St. Augustine) --- God addressed the decalogue to all the people, who saw no similitude. But to Moses he delivered the rest of his ordinances, with as much familiarity and condescension as one friend would use in speaking to another, Exodus xxxiii. 2. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:5:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Mediator.</i> St. Paul acknowledges this title of Moses, (Galatians iii. 9,) who was a figure of Jesus Christ, the mediator of the New Testament, Hebrews viii. 6., ix. 15., and xii. 24. (Calmet) --- Let not Protestants, therefore, reject this title with so much indignation, when it is applied in the like limited sense to the saints, to denote that they pray for us, as we pray for one another. Christ is the <i>one mediator</i> (1 Timothy ii.) of redemption. (Haydock)'
      v:007:
        - 'DEU:5:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Sight.</i> Chaldean, "Thou shalt not have any other god but me." <i>Elohim</i> often designates the true God. (Calmet) --- See the decalogue explained, (Exodus xx.) where we have observed, that pictures are only forbidden when they are the objects of sovereign worship, as the context here plainly shews, ver. 9. Other images God himself authorized, (Worthington) even in the old law, and in the most sacred place, where people were ordered to fall prostrate before the ark, to <i>adore his footstool,</i> Psalm xcviii. 5. If, therefore, a people so prone to idolatry as the Jews were, might have pictures in the temple of God without danger, how can any one suppose that the images of Jesus Christ, and of his saints, are necessary incentive to idolatry among Christians, who all know that God will allow of no rival! (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - "DEU:5:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Serve.</i> We must neither treat idols, nor their images, with the honour due to God alone. (St. Augustine, q. 61, in Gen.) --- If we do, he will punish our infidelity. --- <i>Generation,</i> for a long time, or as long as the remembrance of the parents' wickedness subsists, so as to have an influence upon others. (Haydock) --- God mercifully defers correction. (St. Jerome in Ezec. xviii.) He chastises those who imitate their wicked forefathers."
      v:011:
        - 'DEU:5:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>In vain,</i> by perjury. See ver. 20, where the same word is used, (Du Hamel) or by any irreverent speech. (Menochius)'
      v:015:
        - 'DEU:5:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Therefore.</i> This is another reason why the Jews were to observe the sabbath with particular rigour. The institution of a day of rest every week, (Haydock) was intended to preserve the memory of the creation. (Calmet) --- God also requires that his people should be grateful on this day for the <i>rest</i> which he had granted to them, (Haydock) and preserve carefully all the monuments of the true religion. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - 'DEU:5:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Adultery.</i> Under this name God forbids every species of impurity. (St. Augustine, q. 71.) (Menochius)'
      v:020:
        - 'DEU:5:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>False.</i> Hebrew <i>shave,</i> "vain," is synonymous with <i>sheker,</i> "false," used [in] Exodus xx. 16.'
      v:021:
        - 'DEU:5:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>His.</i> Here the Samaritan copy inserts the order for erecting an altar upon Mount Garizim, which we have given, Exodus xx. 27. It occurs below, chap. xxviii. 2., &c. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - 'DEU:5:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>More</i> to the people: the other precepts were communicated to Moses. The Chaldean and others gives a contrary turn to the Hebrew, "and he ceased not" ever since to instruct us. (Calmet) --- Moses gives the sense, not the very words of the decalogue, in which he is not guilty of any lie. (St. Augustine, q. 8.) (Du Hamel)'
      v:023:
        - 'DEU:5:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>You said,</i> by the mouths of your princes, Exodus xx. 19.'
      v:025:
        - 'DEU:5:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Die.</i> Past experience did not entirely remove from them the fear which was so generally entertained, that the sight of the heavenly beings would prove destructive. So Daniel (chap. x. 17) said on a similar occasion, <i>my breath is stopped.</i> (Haydock)'
      v:029:
        - 'DEU:5:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>A mind.</i> God speaks like men, and insinuates how agreeable to him is a disposition influenced by a salutary fear. He does not mean that He cannot convert the heart of man. (Estius) --- God exerts his power over our will by persuasive invitations. (Maimonides)'
      v:032:
        - 'DEU:5:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Left:</i> a proverbial expression, to signify that no sort of transgression is to be allowed. (Menochius) --- It is of the same import as, <i>You shall not add,</i> &c., chap. iv. 2. (Calmet)'

    commentary:
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:6:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Hear.</i> The Jews have a particular respect for the seven following verses, which they write on vellum, and recite every day, as a preservative against the power of the devil. (Clarius.) --- <i>To do.</i> It will not suffice to hear nor to <i>learn</i> the law, we must also put it in execution, chap. v. 1. (Worthington)'
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:6:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Whole heart....soul....and strength.</i> God admits of no partner, nor will he suffer any rivulet to be drawn from the fountain of love, which is not ultimately referred to himself. Our neighbour we must love only for his sake, and by the observance of this two-fold precept, we shall fulfil the whole law and the prophets, Matthew xxii. 40. (Haydock) See St. Augustine, de Doct. i. 22. --- We must love God disinterestedly for his own sake: we must sacrifice our <i>soul</i> and life for his honour, with all our <i>strength,</i> beginning every good work with fervour, and persevering in our undertakings. All our faculties and senses must be consecrated to the divine service, as well as all our goods; in which sense the Chaldean, &c., understand the word <i>strength.</i> Hebrew literally, <i>ex toto valde tuo.</i> By this singular expression, Moses seems to insinuate, that he cannot find words to specify how much we ought to love the Sovereign Good. (Calmet) --- "The measure of loving God, is to love without measure." (St. Bernard) (Haydock) --- By many words, the same thing is more forcibly inculcated. (Tirinus) (Menochius) --- In the gospel we find, <i>with thy whole mind,</i> (Luke x. 27,) added by the lawyer. (Haydock) --- We must give God the preference before all, and thus have our heart perfect before him, like David, &c. (Tirinus)'
      v:007:
        - 'DEU:6:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Tell.</i> Hebrew, "thou shalt chew them" as nurses do bread for their little ones; or thou shalt "sharpen," like a razor, "explain clearly and often," these precepts, which are of the utmost importance. --- <i>Meditate;</i> speak of them to others, (Calmet) and entertain thyself with them in thy own heart. <i>The mouth of the just man shall meditate wisdom, and</i> (that is) <i>his tongue shall speak judgment,</i> Psalm xxxvi. 30., and Exodus xiii. 9. --- <i>Sleeping.</i> The spouse, in the canticle, (Canticle of Canticles v. 2,) says, <i>I sleep, and my heart watcheth</i>. If we carefully direct our intention, we may merit even when we are incapable of thinking. God will reward our good desires. Our last and first thoughts ought, in a particular manner, to be consecrated to God, (Haydock) when we go to rest and when we arise, (Menochius) as he is our first beginning, the source of all graces, and our last end, to whom we ought to refer every thing, even our ordinary actions of sleeping, labour, and diversion. If we make his divine perfections and his law the subject of our daily meditations, our soul will naturally be affected with the same sentiments during the night. <i>Quicquid luce fuit tenebris agit.</i> "The occurrences of the day have an influence upon our dreams;" (Petronius) and as we are accountable for many things by placing the cause, which in the hours of sleep or of drunkenness we are not able to prevent, so it cannot be doubted but that we shall increase in virtue, if we regulate our thoughts and actions in a proper manner, even when our soul is incapable of exerting her faculties. Hence we may perceive, of what vast importance it is to have a pure intention. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'DEU:6:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Sign,</i> or seal, (Canticle of Canticles viii. 6.; Calmet) attached to the ring which the Jews wore on their fingers, (Haydock) to seal their letters, after they were enveloped and tied with linen. The Jews have bandages of vellum on their hand, with sentences of the law inscribed upon them, (Calmet) as well as others upon their forehead; while many get the whole law, particularly the Book of Deuteronomy, by heart: for which purpose, the Rabbins inform us, there were above 400 schools and synagogues at Jerusalem, where the law of God was learnt and explained. The design of this injunction was not, however, to enforce the wearing of such bandages, as the Pharisees imagined, (Matthew xxiii. 5,) but to put all in mind that they ought to meditate frequently upon the commandments, (Tirinus) and regulate their lives by their direction. --- <i>Shall move.</i> Septuagint adds a negation, but to the same import, "it (the sign) shall not be removed from before thy eyes." (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "they shall be as <i>totaphoth,</i> frontlets," ornaments hanging between the eyes. (Exodus xiii. 9.; Calmet) "Tephilim," (Chaldean) or "spectacles." (Grotius)'
      v:012:
        - 'DEU:6:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Full.</i> Our Saviour seems to apply this to his disciples, in a spiritual sense, remarking that Moses and the prophets had prepared the way for them. <i>Others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours,</i> John iv. 38. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - 'DEU:6:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Only.</i> This is omitted in Hebrew; but the Septuagint and Jesus Christ retain it, (Matthew iv. 10,) as the sense requires. <i>You cannot serve God and mammon,</i> Luke xvi. 13. (Calmet) --- <i>Name,</i> and not by that of idols, whenever you may be authorized to take an oath. (Haydock) --- To <i>swear</i> by any other, is to acknowledge him in some sort for a god. When we take an oath on proper occasions, and with due respect and caution, we perform an act of religion. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'DEU:6:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Temptation.</i> Hebrew, "in <i>Massa,</i>" where Moses gave the people water from Horeb, Exodus xvii. 7.'
      v:025:
        - 'DEU:6:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Merciful.</i> Hebrew, "he will justify us." Chaldean, "reward us." Justice often denotes the mercy which God shews to his people, and the punishment which he inflicts upon their enemies. (Calmet) (Matthew vi. 1.) --- Past, present, and future benefits concur to make the Hebrews observe the commandments. God had rescued them from slavery; (ver. 21,) he had already given them great possessions, and would grant them still more if they would be faithful; as on the other hand, all will be lost if they prove rebellious, ver. 15. (Haydock)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'DEU:7:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Destroyed.</i> So the Vulgate often expresses the Hebrew term, which signifies, "to cast out." --- <i>Seven.</i> Ten are mentioned, Genesis xv. 9; but some of the less powerful nations were either mixed with the others, or were exterminated. The Hevites are omitted in the passage of Genesis, and sometimes no notice is taken of the Gergezite or the Pherezite. The latter had been already conquered by Moses, as well as the Raphaim and Amorrhites, over whom Og and Sehon ruled, chap. iii. 5. (Calmet) --- It seems, however, that some of the same nations, on the other side of the Jordan, remained to be subdued, and that any one of them was naturally too strong for the Hebrews, ver. 7. Hence the latter might be convinced, that their victories were to be attributed to God.'
      v:002:
        - "DEU:7:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>League.</i> Yet Josue, (ix. 3,) by mistake, entered into one with the Gabaonites, and observed it; (Haydock) whence we may conclude, that only such leagues are forbidden as would leave these nations in possession of their lands and idols, chap. xx. 10., and xxiii. 6. With foreign nations it was lawful to make leagues defensive and offensive, as David, Asa, and the Machabees did with Hiram, Benadad, and the Romans, 3 Kings xv. 18, &c. If the Hebrews were so hostile to the nations of Chanaan, it was in execution of God's decree, who had sentenced them to die; and Tacitus hence unjustly inferred, that <i>they hated all</i> but their own nation. See Grotius, Jur. ii. 15. --- <i>Them.</i> This was ill executed. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xiii. 13.) (Judges i.) (Menochius)"
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:7:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Marriages.</i> Some believe that it was unlawful to marry the people of Chanaan, if they were even converted, and also those of other nations, as we find that Esdras (1 Esdras x. 2, 12,) ordered such <i>strange wives</i> to be sent away. But the context shews, as well as the practice of most pious Hebrews, that it was only forbidden to marry with those who adhered to their idolatry, ver. 4. Salmon took to wife Rahab, of Jericho; Mahalon and Booz successively married Ruth, the Moabitess, and Moses himself allows the Hebrews to espouse their captives, and to preserve the lives of women and children, chap. xx. 14., and xxi. 11. (Calmet) See Exodus xxxiv. 15. --- Hence all the Chanaanites were not necessarily to be slain. The few exceptions did not hinder the rule from being general. See ver. 16., and Numbers xiv. 23.'
      v:004:
        - 'DEU:7:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Gods.</i> So great is the natural tendency to evil, that though a woman be generally inclined to follow the inclinations and religion of her husband, yet, when his method of living is more repugnant to flesh and blood, she is but too apt to influence him to glide smoothly with her down the hill of pleasure, into the very abyss of dissolution. The prediction, <i>she will turn,</i> &c., is so often verified, that those who marry with unbelievers ought to tremble. (Haydock)'
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:7:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Things.</i> This was to be done with regard to the idols of Chanaan, when it was first conquered, ver. 25. Afterwards David made no scruple in wearing a crown, which had been taken from the spoils of Melchon, the idol of the Ammonites, 1 Paralipomenon xx. 2. (Calmet)'
      v:006:
        - 'DEU:7:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Peculiar.</i> Hebrew <i>sogula,</i> laid up like something most precious and desirable. (Menochius) --- God seemed to have abandoned other nations to the corruption of their own heart. "This was, by a particular mystery, a prophetical nation." (St. Augustine, ep. cii.) (Exodus xix. 5.) (Calmet) --- Therefore must they destroy every idol in their land, to set a pattern to all other less favoured nations how they ought also to treat them.'
      v:007:
        - 'DEU:7:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Joined.</i> Hebrew, "has set his love upon you." God is the most disinterested lover. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'DEU:7:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Strong.</i> Hebrew <i>el,</i> means also God. He requires us to imitate his perfections, as much as we are able. Being <i>faithful,</i> he will comply with his <i>covenant</i> exactly, and will punish those who neglect it. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - 'DEU:7:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Deserve.</i> Hebrew, "he will repay to his face," or "he will punish immediately the person who hateth him to his face." God does not always defer the correction of the wicked till their death. (Calmet) --- But this seems to be spoken principally of those who have engaged in the covenant, 2 Machabees vi. 12. (Du Hamel) --- Thus he immediately chastised those who adored the calf, Core, Mary [Miriam], &c., (Menochius) and he does not dissemble the faults even of his chosen servants. (Tirinus) --- The Chaldean and some Rabbins give another interpretation. "The Lord rewards his enemies for the good works which they perform in this life, reserving their punishment till the life to come. He does not delay to reward what good they do, but he will punish them (for their crimes) in another world." (Calmet)'
      v:012:
        - DEU:7:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>If.</i> The promises of God to the Hebrews were conditional. (Worthington)
      v:013:
        - 'DEU:7:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Womb.</i> He will grant thee many children. (Menochius) --- This was esteemed a very great blessing, at a time when they might hope to give birth to the Messias. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'DEU:7:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Cattle.</i> This shews, that no precept to marry is here given, but only a blessing. Even men cannot be commanded not to be <em>barren</em>, as that is not in their own power. It was, however, deemed a mark of some secret transgression when married people had no children. (Vasques.) (Tirinus)'
      v:015:
        - 'DEU:7:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Sickness,</i> sent in punishment of sin, (Haydock) like the plagues <i>of Egypt,</i> Exodus ix. (Menochius) --- Egypt was afflicted with some peculiar disorders, such as the leprosy, called <i>Elephantiasis.</i> (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxvi. 1.) The people were also much troubled with sore eyes, or blindness, and with ulcers upon their legs. (Juvenal, Sat. xiii. 91.) One-fourth of the inhabitants of Grand Cairo have sore eyes, or are blind. (Brun.) --- Joinville speaks of the diseases which attacked the army of St. Louis in Egypt, preying chiefly upon the legs and gums, and causing them to putrify. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'DEU:7:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Consume.</i> Kill the inhabitants, plunder their effects, (Menochius) destroy their idols.'
      v:019:
        - 'DEU:7:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Plagues.</i> Hebrew, "trials." God manifested by this means the latent dispositions of the Egyptians, while he punished their wickedness at the same time. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'DEU:7:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Hornets.</i> Abenezra understands the leprosy, which the Hebrew may also signify. But hornets and such like insects are very destructive in hot countries; and Pausanias informs us that the Minsiens were driven out of their country by them. (Calmet) --- God destroyed the army of Sapor II, the Persian king, by sending an army of gnats, at the prayer of St. James of Nisibis, A.D. 350. "Lord, said the saint, thou art able by the weakest means to humble the pride of thy enemies, defeat these multitudes by an army of gnats." (Butler, Lives of the Saints, July 11.) --- We may, therefore, explain this text in a literal sense. (Calmet) (Wisdom xii. 8., and xvi. 9., and Josue xxiv. 12.)'
      v:021:
        - 'DEU:7:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Fear.</i> Septuagint, "be wounded." In the war with the Madianites, not one was killed, (Numbers xxxi. 49,) as Josephus ([Antiquities?] iii. 2,) informs us, was also the case when king Amalec and his people attacked the Hebrews, Exodus xvii. 13. The people seem to have expected such a miraculous interference of Providence in their favour; and hence, when 36 were slain at the siege of Hai, all were greatly dejected, Josue vii. 5. (Haydock)'
      v:022:
        - 'DEU:7:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Thee.</i> Three millions of people not being sufficient to cultivate the land, Exodus xxiii. 29. (Menochius) --- God could easily have destroyed those mighty nations at once; but he would not give the Israelites any occasion of boasting. (Du Hamel) --- If they never succeeded to expel them entirely out of the country, they might attribute it to their own negligence and other sins. (Haydock)'
      v:025:

      v:026:
        - 'DEU:7:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>An anathema.</i> That is, a thing devoted to destruction; and which carries along with it a curse. (Challoner) --- <i>Like it.</i> The curse rested upon those who kept any of the spoils. This brought death upon Achan, (Josue vii. 1,) and upon some of the soldiers of Judas the Machabee, who had secreted <i>some of the donaries of the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbiddeth to the Jews,</i> 2 Machabees xii. 40.

      v:001: 'DEU:7:1 | 1 | 1 | When {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, which thou art going in to possess, and shall have destroyed many nations before thee, {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 1}the Hethite, and the Gergezite, and the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, seven nations much more numerous than thou art, and stronger than thou:'
      v:002: 'DEU:7:2 | 2 | 2 | And the Lord thy God shall have delivered them to thee, thou shalt utterly destroy them. {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Thou shalt make no league with them, nor shew mercy to them:'
      v:003: 'DEU:7:3 | 3 | 3 | Neither shalt thou make marriages with them. Thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son, nor take his daughter for thy son:'
      v:004: 'DEU:7:4 | 4 | 4 | For she will turn away thy son from following me, that he may rather serve strange gods, and the wrath of the Lord will be kindled, and will quickly destroy thee.'
      v:005: 'DEU:7:5 | 5 | 5 | But thus rather shall you deal with them: {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Destroy their altars, and break their statues, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven things:'
      v:006: 'DEU:7:6 | 6 | 6 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God. {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 1}The Lord thy God hath chosen thee, to be his peculiar people, of all peoples that are upon the earth.'
      v:007: 'DEU:7:7 | 7 | 7 | Not because you surpass all nations in number, is the Lord joined unto you, and hath chosen you, for you are the fewest of any people:'
      v:008: 'DEU:7:8 | 8 | 8 | But because the Lord hath loved you, and hath kept his oath, which he swore to your fathers: and hath brought you out with a strong hand, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, out of the hand of Pharao the king of Egypt.'
      v:009: 'DEU:7:9 | 9 | 9 | And thou shalt know, that the Lord thy God, he is a strong and faithful God, keeping his covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments, unto a thousand generations:'
      v:010: 'DEU:7:10 | 10 | 10 | And repaying forthwith them that hate him, so as to destroy them, without further delay, immediately rendering to them what they deserve.'
      v:011: 'DEU:7:11 | 11 | 11 | Keep therefore the precepts and ceremonies, and judgments, which I command thee this day to do.'
      v:012: 'DEU:7:12 | 12 | 12 | If after thou hast heard these judgments, thou keep and do them, the Lord thy God will also keep his covenant to thee, and the mercy which he swore to thy fathers:'
      v:013: 'DEU:7:13 | 13 | 13 | And he will love thee and multiply thee, and will bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy vintage, thy oil, and thy herds, <i>and</i> the flocks of thy sheep upon the land, for which he swore to thy fathers that he would give it thee.'
      v:014: 'DEU:7:14 | 14 | 14 | Blessed shalt thou be among all people. {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}No one shall be barren among you of either sex, neither of men, nor cattle.'
      v:015: 'DEU:7:15 | 15 | 15 | The Lord will take away from thee all sickness: and the grievous infirmities of Egypt, which thou knowest, he will not bring upon thee, but upon thy enemies.'
      v:016: 'DEU:7:16 | 16 | 16 | Thou shalt consume all the people, which the Lord thy God will deliver to thee. Thy eye shall not spare them, neither shalt thou serve their gods, lest they be thy ruin.'
      v:017: 'DEU:7:17 | 17 | 17 | If thou say in thy heart: These nations are more than I, how shall I be able to destroy them?'

      v:019: 'DEU:7:19 | 19 | 19 | The exceeding great plagues, which thy eyes saw, and the signs and wonders, and the strong hand, and the stretched-out arm, with which the Lord thy God brought thee out: so will he do to all the people, whom thou fearest.'
      v:020: 'DEU:7:20 | 20 | 20 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Moreover the Lord thy God will send also hornets among them, until he destroy and consume all that have escaped thee, and could hide themselves.'
      v:021: 'DEU:7:21 | 21 | 21 | Thou shalt not fear them, because the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee, a God mighty and terrible:'
      v:022: 'DEU:7:22 | 22 | 22 | He will consume these nations in thy sight by little and little and by degrees. Thou wilt not be able to destroy them altogether, lest perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase upon thee.'
      v:023: 'DEU:7:23 | 23 | 23 | But the Lord thy God shall deliver them in thy sight: and shall slay them until they be utterly destroyed.'
      v:024: 'DEU:7:24 | 24 | 24 | And he shall deliver their kings into thy hands, and thou shalt destroy their names from under heaven: no man shall be able to resist thee, until thou destroy them.'
      v:025: 'DEU:7:25 | 25 | 25 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Their graven things thou shalt burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver and gold, of which they are made, neither shalt thou take to thee any thing thereof, lest thou offend, because it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.'
      v:026: 'DEU:7:26 | 26 | 26 | Neither shalt thou bring any thing of the idol into thy house, lest thou become an anathema, like it. Thou shalt detest it as dung, and shalt utterly abhor it as uncleanness and filth, because it is an anathema.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - "DEU:8:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Live</i> a long and happy life; which was often promised to the carnal Jews, to encourage them to fulfil God's commands. Christians are willing to forego these temporal advantages, that they may obtain such as may last for ever. (Calmet)"
      v:002:
        - 'DEU:8:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Prove,</i> which is done frequently by posterity also, ver. 3, 12, 14. After trying the fidelity of his people by various means, to make them sensible of their own weakness and inability to do good, God takes pity on them, ver. 16. (Calmet) --- <i>Known.</i> Hebrew, "to know (by experience) what was in thy heart, whether," &c. The original term signifies also to make known to others, Genesis xxii. 12. (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - "DEU:8:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Not in bread alone,</i> &c. <i>i.e.</i> That God is able to make food of what he pleases for the support of man. (Challoner) --- Obedience to his law will ensure a happy life, ver. 1. --- God can support a person's life without any sustenance, as he did Moses, Elias, &c., for a long time. When the usual food is wanting, he can send some of a supernatural kind, as he did the <i>manna.</i> --- <i>Word.</i> Hebrew, \"by whatever proceedeth,\" &c. The Septuagint and our Saviour (Matthew iv. 4,) cite it, however, agreeably to the Vulgate. The word of God and Jesus Christ nourish our souls. (St. Chrysostom) --- Philo says, \"God feeds us with his most universal word...which is more ancient than the creation.\" (Calmet) --- God could make the most poisonous things afford more nutrition, if he commanded us to eat them, than even the most delicious viands. (Abulensis) (Tirinus) --- God can make food of whatever He pleases, or sustain men without meat. (Worthington)"
      v:004:
        - "DEU:8:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Worn,</i> for want of shoes, chap. xxix. 5. (Chaldean) This miracle of the Hebrews, being so well provided with raiment in a desert country, is mentioned, 2 Esdras ix. 21. Cosmas (B. v.) allows only that merchants constantly supplied them, and Abenezra thinks that they had brought plenty for change out of Egypt. (Calmet) --- But the Scripture seems to acknowledge something more wonderful; namely, the good condition of the people's feet, and of their garments, after they had been worn for such a length of time. As their numbers had not increased, the children might be supplied with the clothes of the deceased; so that there is no need of making the miracle still greater, by asserting, as some have done, that the garments grew larger with the bodies of those who wore them. (Haydock) --- The miracle was in favour both of good and bad, like manna, &c. (Tirinus)"
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:8:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Up,</i> by mildness and correction alternately. Hebrew, "chastiseth thee," Proverbs iii. 12.'
      v:007:
        - 'DEU:8:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Out.</i> The Jordan was the only river of consequence; but there were many torrents, &c., which rendered the country very different from that where they had been travelling for 40 years. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "of fountains, of abysses, which spring in vales and on mountains," having their origin in the sea. (Chaldean; Ecclesiastes i. 7.) "Judea is famous for its waters," says Solinus, (35,) "and the Jordan, a most enchanting river, runs through regions of equal beauty." (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - 'DEU:8:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Honey,</i> extracted from dates. (Du Hamel) --- Almost all the luxuries of the earth might be found in the promised land; so that it was justly said to flow <i>with milk and honey.</i> (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'DEU:8:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Iron,</i> equal in hardness, and used to cut things, in the same manner as we use iron or steel, Isaias lx. 17. --- <i>Brass.</i> There were mines of both in Mount Libanus; and David collected great quantities of such metals from Cœlosyria, 3 Kings xviii. 8., and 1 Paralipomenon xxii. 3, 14. Sidon was noted for its brass. (Homer, Odyssey xv. 425.) Sarepta probably took its name from the "foundry" established there. Dan and Aser had abundance of iron and of brass, chap. xxxiii. 25., and Ezechiel xxvii. 19. Cadmus brought from this country the art of melting gold, &c., into Greece. (Pliny, [Natural History?] vii. 56. In latter ages, many Christians were condemned to work in the mines of Palestine. (Eusebius)'
      v:010:
        - "DEU:8:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Bless,</i> not forgetting to give thanks after meat, as well as to beg God's blessing before: <i>for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer,</i> 1 Timothy iv. 45. (Menochius) --- <i>In all things give thanks,</i> 1 Thessalonians v. 18. Our Saviour did so at the last supper, Matthew xxvi. 26. At taking the cup, the Jews say, \"Blessed be thou, O Lord, who createdst the fruit of the vine.\" At the end of the repast, one of the most dignified at table, holding a cup full of wine, says, \"Let us bless Him, who has fed us with his goods, and who preserves our life by his goodness;\" and all answer, \"Blessed be He from whom we have received food and life:\" after which a long prayer is recited. (Fagius) --- In compliance with this custom, our Lord took the <i>cup after supper,</i> and recited (Haydock) or sung a <i>hymn,</i> Luke xxii. 20., and Matthew xxvi. 30. (Calmet)"
      v:015:
        - 'DEU:8:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Breath.</i> Hebrew <i>saraphh,</i> or the basilisk, as it is rendered, Isaias xxx. 6. It destroys both the grass and animals, by the burning infection of its breath. (Galen; Pliny, [Natural History?] viii. 19. See Numbers xxi. 6. (Tirinus) --- <i>Scorpion</i> stings with its tail. --- <i>Dipsas.</i> A serpent whose bite causes a violent thirst: from whence it has its name; for in Greek, <i>dipsa</i> signifies <i>thirst.</i> (Challoner) --- It is impossible to quench this thirst, (Worthington) and those who are bitten by this serpent can discharge no water. (Calmet) --- They drink till they burst, unless they can procure some treacle, or remedy against the poison. (Dioscorides) (Tirinus) --- Some translate the Hebrew, "scorpions, and (<i>at the place of</i>) drought, where there was no water: he brought," &c., whether <i>Tsommaon</i> be the name of a particular place, (Isaias xxxv. 7.; Onkelos; Calmet) or it may be applied to the greatest part of that desert, where the want of water so often occasioned the murmurs of the people. (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - 'DEU:8:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>For me.</i> Hebrew, "hath procured me this wealth," or <i>strength,</i> ver. 18.'
      v:019:
        - 'DEU:8:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Thee.</i> Hebrew, "I attest this day against you, (Septuagint add heaven and earth,) that you shall," &c. God had already forbidden the worship of strange gods, Exodus xx. 3. He now threatens to punish the transgressors most severely. All nations have deemed it criminal to abandon the religion of their ancestors, unless when there were evident proofs of its absurdity, as was the case when so many embraced the doctrine of Jesus Christ, for which they were so cruelly persecuted. The Athenians would not suffer a word to be spoken against their gods; (Josephus, contra Ap. ii.) and Cicero (Leg. ii.) lays down this as a law, "Let no one have gods to himself, nor any new ones: let him not adore, even in private, strange gods; unless they have been publicly acknowledged." (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - 'DEU:8:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Destroyed.</i> Hebrew, "destroys." Some were already subdued, others on the brink of ruin. --- <i>Disobedient to.</i> God punished this sin in the most exemplary manner. (Haydock)'

        - 'DEU:9:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Stand.</i> Hebrew, "who can stand before the sons of Enak?" as if this were a sort of proverb. (Calmet) --- The spies had formerly terrified the people with the report of the high walls and gigantic inhabitants of Chanaan, Numbers xiii. 18.'

      v:007:
        - 'DEU:9:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Strove.</i> Hebrew, "irritated." (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "continually disbelieved the Lord." Moses hence takes occasion to lay before the people their frequent and most heinous offences, on account of which they might justly have feared being destroyed, as much as the infamous nations whom they were about to supplant. They might thus be convinced that they had been chosen gratuitously. (Haydock) --- For God hates nothing more than ingratitude and presumption. (Calmet)'

        - 'DEU:9:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Have quickly.</i> Hebrew, "have become corrupt; they have quickly abandoned the way which I commanded them." (Haydock) --- Septuagint, "the people hath sinned....they have quickly transgressed," &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Idol.</i> Protestants have "image." The Hebrews had called the similitude of a calf their god, Exodus xxxii. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - 'DEU:9:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Sinned,</i> by idolatry, which comprises every sort of sin. Hence the Scripture only specifies that Jeroboam caused Israel <i>to sin,</i> when it means to assert that he engaged the people in the worship of idols. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - 'DEU:9:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Sins.</i> Many believe that Moses spent the whole time in obtaining pardon. Hiscuni agrees herein with the other Rabbins, only he thinks Moses was all the time in the tabernacle. Other 40 days, or a third rigid fast, were requisite to obtain the second tables of the law, as the text seems to insinuate, (ver. 25., and chap. x. 10,) unless Moses repeat what he has here asserted, as many able chronologers suppose. (Torneil; Usher; &c.) (Calmet) (Tirinus) --- The former opinion is maintained, however, by Salien, &c., Exodus xxxiv. (Haydock)'
      v:021:
        - 'DEU:9:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Sin.</i> The Scripture designates by this name not only the evil action, but also the propensity to it, the object, matter, occasion, punishment , or victim of sin. --- <i>The calf.</i> He broke the idol in pieces, and then ground it small, Exodus xxxii. 20. (Calmet)'

        - 'DEU:9:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Burning,</i> &c. The places called in Hebrew, "Tabera, Masa, and Kibroth Hattaavah." (Haydock) --- At the first, the murmurers were burnt; (Numbers xi. 1) at the second, or at Raphidim, (Calmet) the people demanded water, and were supplied from Horeb; (Exodus xvii. 2, 7.; Menochius) though some confound this with the former place. It seems rather to refer to the <i>temptation,</i> or murmur of the people, on account of quails, Numbers xi. 34., and Psalm lxxvii. 18. (Calmet)'

        - 'DEU:9:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Slighted.</i> Hebrew, "rebelled against," &c., as [in] ver. 24. Septuagint, "you were incredulous to." See Numbers xiii. 3.'
      v:024:
        - 'DEU:9:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>To know you.</i> When Moses slew the Egyptian, and would have pacified two of his contending brethren, they refused to receive his mediation; so also, when he returned from Madian, to rescue them from slavery, they presently began to murmur against him, and continued to do so frequently for 40 years. (Haydock) --- Septuagint refers this to God, "from the day that he was known to you," and received you for his peculiar people, Exodus xi. 25.'

(Haydock) --- Some people believe that Moses was thrice 40 days in the mountain. He mentions the prayer which he addressed to God before his first descent, Exodus xxxii. 11. (Menochius)'

        - 'DEU:10:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Wood.</i> Moses had received this injunction, before he ascended the mount the second time, Exodus xxv. 10. But he executed it only after he had received the second tables of the law, Exodus xxxvii. 1. (Menochius) --- Some pretend that the made an ark of setim-wood, to contain the tables, till Beseleel should have completed his, which was covered with gold, and inclosed the former. (Drusius) --- But this seems unnecessary. (Calmet)'

      v:006:
        - 'DEU:10:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Mosera,</i> by Mount Hor, for there Aaron died, Numbers xx. This and the following verses seem to be inserted by way of parenthesis, (Challoner) as far as the 10th. The reason of their insertion here cannot easily be explained; but we must adore, in silence, the designs of the Holy Spirit. (Calmet) --- Moses had just mentioned the ark, designed to contain the tables of the law; and as the priests and Levites were to be the guardians of those sacred things, he takes occasion to specify something with respect to their institution, &c. Mosera was perhaps twice visited by the Hebrews. The first time, they came thither from <i>Beroth</i>-Benejaacan, or from "the well <i>of the children of Jacan,</i>" and thence measured back their steps; though, the second time, Mosera, or Moseroth, is not noticed, because it had been specified already, and they did not stop long there, but proceeded to Gadgad, Numbers xxxiii. 30. (Bonfrere) (Menochius) --- Others think that Mosera and Benejaacan are not the same places as Moseroth and Beroth Bensacan, though the names be similar. (Cornelius a Lapide) --- Perhaps it will be more satisfactory to acknowledge, that Mosera has been transposed by the copyists, as it ought to come before Beroth, particularly as Moses places it in that order, where he gives an account of the 42 stations; and the Samaritan copy agrees with him in this place. (Calmet) --- It also retains many words which have been omitted in Hebrew, and in all the versions taken from it; whence the omission seems to have taken place before the appearance of the version of the Septuagint. The Samaritan version, which is acknowledged to have preceded the Septuagint, agrees with its text, and reads, "And the children of Israel journeyed from <i>Moseroth,</i> and pitched in <i>Benejaakan:</i> from thence they journeyed, and pitched in <i>Hagidgad:</i> from thence they journeyed, and pitched in <i>Jotbathah,</i> a land of rivers of waters: from thence they journeyed, and pitched in <i>Ebronah:</i> from thence they journeyed, and pitched in <i>Eziongaber:</i> from thence they journeyed, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin, which is <i>Kadesh:</i> from thence they journeyed, and pitched in Mount <i>Hor.</i> And there Aaron died," &c. (Kennicott, 2. Dis.) --- Thus Mosera will be the 27th, and Mount Hor the 34th station; (Pococke) whence the Israelites departed, after the death of Aaron, to Salmona, directing their course to the countries east of the Jordan, which had been promised to them. The appointment of Eleazar to succeed Aaron, and the separation of the Levites unto the Lord, should be all placed together, after the different encampments. (Haydock)'
      v:008:
        - 'DEU:10:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Time,</i> during the pontificate of Aaron, Numbers iii. 6. (Menochius) --- God had made this appointment at Sinai, (Exodus xxviii. 1,) where he ordered the tabernacle and the priests to be consecrated. Upon the sedition of Core, which probably took place at Jetebata, he confirmed the rights of the Levitical tribe, Numbers xvi. 17, 18. (Calmet) --- <i>Ark.</i> The priests carried it, on more solemn occasions, (Josue iii. 3,) as they also blessed the people. (Menochius) --- Yet the Levites sung the praises of God, in which sense the word <em>blessing</em> is often used, 1 Paralipomenon xxiii. 13. Hence Castalio translates, "to celebrate his name."'
      v:010:
        - 'DEU:10:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Stood.</i> Moses does not follow the order of events, but recalls to the minds of his audience what might serve to make the deepest impression upon them. He mentions some farther instructions which he had received from God on Mount Sinai, during the second term of 40 days. (Calmet) --- It might have been placed in a more natural order at the head of this chapter. (Menochius) --- Some believe that Moses speaks of the third fast of 40 days. (Salien)'

God stands not in need of our services, (ver. 14,) but chooses whom he pleases to display the treasures of his love, (ver. 15,) which ought to move us strongly to make him a suitable return of gratitude, (Calmet) by withdrawing our affections from every thing that may be displeasing to him, ver. 16. If we refuse, we must expect to fall under the rod of his indignation, notwithstanding all the efforts of his clemency, which he holds forth for our imitation, ver. 17, 19. He will judge all alike, the rich and the poor. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - 'DEU:10:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Of heaven.</i> The Scripture mentions the third heaven, (2 Corinthians xii. 2,) where the majesty of God most gloriously appears. The second is the region of the stars, and the first the atmosphere, where the birds and the clouds move about. (Calmet)'

      v:016:
        - 'DEU:10:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Circumcise.</i> The Hebrews esteem circumcision as a mark of their greatest glory. All who had it not, were looked upon as profane. They call the ears, mind, and heart uncircumcised, when they would not hear, understand, or obey the law of God. St. Paul (Romans ii. 28) frequently inculcates this interior circumcision, to which Moses alludes in these his last exhortations, chap. xxx. 6. The people had not regularly practised circumcision in the desert. Moses takes care to raise their thoughts to something more spiritual; and declares, in clearer terms than he had hitherto done, the necessity of loving God. All must be banished from the heart which might resist this love. (Calmet) --- Vanity, blindness, luxury, must be retrenched. (Menochius)'
      v:017:
        - 'DEU:10:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Gods.</i> Idols are <i>nothing,</i> 1 Corinthians viii. 4. Hence Theodoret supposes, that all who have authority upon earth are here designated. But admitting the false notions of the pagans respecting their gods, the superiority of the true God is here asserted; (Calmet) and all, both in heaven and on earth, <i>gods and lords,</i> must bow before him. (Haydock)'

      v:021:
        - 'DEU:10:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Praise,</i> the object whom thou must praise, and the source of all thy happiness and glory. Other nations will revere the Jews on this account. (Calmet) --- An ancient oracle could not refuse giving them this singular commendation, though to the prejudice of idolatry. "Chaldeans alone philosophy may claim---but Hebrews worship God, the self-born King---with pure religion." (Haydock) --- <i>agnós,</i> (Calmet) St. Cyril, contra Julian 5., and St. Justin Martyr, Hortatory Address to the Greeks xi., read auton, <i>him.</i> But the meaning is clear from the context. The palm of wisdom is given to the Chaldeans for natural learning, and to the Jews for divinity. (Watson, Proleg. xii.) Porphyrius owns the oracle. (Theodoret) (Haydock)'

(Philo) --- Solinus (ii. 22, 36,) takes notice of this inconvenience in Egypt. The country is watered only by the Nile, which overflows for six weeks, about the beginning of June. Various canals or reservoirs are formed to preserve a sufficient supply of water during the remainder of the year. Pliny ([Natural History?] xviii.) observes, that "if the Nile rise less than 12, or more than 16 cubits high, famine is inevitable." (Calmet) See Genesis xlii. 3. --- Prince Radzivil saw the canals of Egypt, which the people said had been dug by the Hebrews. Augustus ordered his soldiers to clean them out. (Suetonius, c. 18.) --- After the seed was committed to the earth, it was necessary to water it frequently, as the sun would harden the soil too much. No rain falls in that part of Egypt where the Hebrews had dwelt, according to many respectable authors; (Tirinus) or at least what little may fall is not sufficient to keep the earth moist. Proclus allows that some showers are felt in Lower Egypt, which lies nearest to the Mediterranean Sea; and travellers often take notice of them, in their journeys from Alexandria to Memphis. Yet the country in general is destitute of this advantage, Zacharias xiv. 18. (Lloyd) (Haydock)'

It fell at the beginning of the Jewish year, which commenced in September, Joel ii. 23., and Zacharias x. 1.

But this is a mistake: for Jotham addressed the inhabitants of Sichem from that mountain, Judges ix. 7. Morizon informs us that it is of the same shape as Hebal, and separated from it only by a valley of about 200 paces, in which the town of Sichem stands. Hebal is a barren rock, while Garizim is very fertile, (Ludolf.) though an ancient poet makes both equally covered with verdure. (Ap. Eusebius, præp. ix. 22.) (Calmet)'

The Chanaanite inhabited all that region, from Galgal to Sichem. How far these places were distant from each other, is not here specified; though Eusebius seems to have inferred from this text, that Garizim was near Jericho.

The very names of the idols must be abhorred and obliterated, (Exodus xxiii. 13,) to shew that they have lost possession of the country.

        - 'DEU:12:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Himself.</i> Some confine this to the sacrifices, which each person might offer, where he thought proper, till the ark was fixed at Silo. But many other parts of the ceremonial law, seem not to have been in force till the Hebrews crossed the Jordan, Amos v. 25. Circumcision was omitted, as well as most of the festivals. Several laws were, however, designed for the people during their sojournment, such as those which regard the order of judgment, the cleanness of the camp, the purification of women, and of those who had touched a dead body, &c., Exodus xviii. 25., Numbers v. 2., and Leviticus xv. 31. It was not left to their option to observe or to neglect the sabbath, (Numbers xv. 32,) the loaves of proposition, or the perpetual fire, &c., Numbers iv. 7, 13. (Calmet)'

(Haydock) --- The Vulgate translates ver. 22 in this sense, intimating that these meats did not contract any such peculiar sanctity, as to exclude those who were unclean, ver. 20., and Leviticus xvii. 3. Fagius pretends, that only the clean were allowed as yet to eat of such meats, though the unclean might eat in the promised land what was lawful, without bringing the beast to be slain before the tabernacle. But this opinion seems to have no solid foundation. Unclean beasts could never be eaten. (Calmet) --- But those which had any defect, were excluded from being sacrificed, Leviticus xxii. 22.

The first-born, if it proved to be without defect, and a male, was given to the priests, Numbers xviii. 15. --- <i>Voluntarily.</i> If the thing was vowed to the Lord without restriction, it fell to the share of the priests alone: but if the person specified that he intended it for a peace-offering, &c., the priest could only claim what was allotted to him by the law.

Others suppose that all were under the same predicament, and are hereby authorized to follow the same regulations, and to eat the flesh, whether they be clean or otherwise, provided they abstain from the blood. See Leviticus xvii. 3. (Calmet) --- The custom of bringing the beasts to be slain before the door of the tabernacle, was to be no longer obligatory. (Menochius)'
      v:022:
        - 'DEU:12:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Alike.</i> This must be understood of those who had contracted only a smaller stain, which did not communicate the uncleanness to others, but debarred people from approaching to sacred things. (Calmet) --- Those who had touched the dead, &c., were not allowed to eat with people, who were not under any such legal uncleanness. (Menochius)'
      v:023:
        - 'DEU:12:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Soul.</i> See Genesis ix. 4. Blood maintains the life of animals, and it would seem cruel to begin to eat them before they were perfectly dead. But the obligation of this positive law has long ago ceased, as it was intended chiefly for the Jews.'

      v:030:
        - 'DEU:12:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Imitate.</i> Hebrew, "be ensnared by imitation them." The example of the wicked, is one of the most dangerous snares which the devil can place in our way. Notwithstanding these repeated admonitions of God, we see how prone the Hebrews were to adopt the superstitious customs of these nations, whose destruction ought surely to have warned them to keep at a distance.

(Challoner) --- To adopt fresh regulations, in the same spirit, was not forbidden. Thus David ordered those who had kept the baggage, to share equally with the soldiers who had gone into battle; (1 Kings xxx.) and our Saviour approved, by his presence, the feast of the dedication of the temple, instituted long after Moses, 1 Machabees iv., and John x. (Worthington) --- He perfected the law by the precepts of the gospel, Matthew v. 17. Jospehus (contra Apion ii.) says, "During so many years, no one has dared to retrench any thing from, (the sacred books) or to make any addition to them. We look upon them as of divine authority,....and we would lay down our lives, if necessary, to defend them. (Calmet) Among us, who believe that the law was first given by the will of God, nothing is pious but the exact observance of it. For who can introduce any change, or invent any thing better?" (Chap. iv. 2.) Christ is <i>full of grace and truth,</i> John i. He has fulfilled the law and the prophets. (Haydock) St. Augustine, contra Faustus xvii. 2, and xix. 9.---"<i>Grace,</i> says he, pertains to the fulness of charity, <i>truth</i> to the completion of the prophecies." (Du Hamel)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'DEU:13:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>If....a prophet,</i> or even <i>an angel from heaven,</i> as St. Paul (Galatians i. 8,) says on a similar occasion, (Calmet) should work a miracle, and afterwards adduce it in proof of a false religion, believe him not. The Jews and Christians had already received such convincing proofs from God, of the truth of what they had been taught, that they had reason to conclude either that the miracle was false, or that the person who would persuade them to embrace a different religion had fallen, after God had honoured him with miraculous powers: or, in fine, that if he were an impostor at the time when he exercised that power, like the magicians of Egypt, or Balaam, the miracle was either not wrought in confirmation of what he preached, or at least it was eclipsed by some greater miracle in favour of the truth. Whether God will ever suffer a real miracle which may seem to countenance error, or not, this appears to be unquestionable, that he will never <i>deny himself,</i> or, in a contest of miracles, permit falsehood to gain the victory. If the magicians performed wonderful works, they were forced at last to confess their inferiority, and yield to Moses, Exodus viii. 18, 19. Miracles are generally a proof of the truth of any doctrine; but when the doctrine is already established, as in this case of the unity of God, (ver. 2,) it may be adduced with propriety as a criterion of miracles. Truth can never be in contradiction to truth. The light of reason suffices to evince that there is but one God. The same truth had been repeatedly confirmed by miracles, particularly during the last forty years, during which God had manifested his power over all nature, in the sight of all the Hebrews, and had trampled on the idols of the Gentiles. If therefore any person should attempt, by his dreams or predictions, to invalidate this most fundamental and undeniable article, his testimony could not be received. (Haydock) --- The Jews, in vain, allege this passage against the religion of Jesus Christ. He did not subvert, but fulfilled the law; so far was he from endeavouring to persuade them to abandon the true God. (Calmet) --- If he had not come to act in this manner, the law would have contained in itself the seeds of dissolution, by <i>falsely</i> holding forth the expectation of a future Messias, who would bring all things to perfection, chap. xviii. 15., Genesis iii. 15., and xlix. 10, &c. Hence when he really appeared, the Jews desired him to prove his mission by a miracle, as he did repeatedly, Matthew xii. 38., John viii. 40., and x. 25. --- <i>A dream,</i> of a mysterious kind, like those of Joseph and of the prophets. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - 'DEU:13:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>To pass.</i> The completion of a prophecy does not always prove, that the person who uttered it was a true prophet. Chance, a knowledge of natural causes, &c., may enable an impostor sometimes to hit upon the truth. God may also, for reasons known to himself, declare what will come to pass by the mouth of a false prophet, or of a wicked man, as he did by Balaam and Caiphas. Judas wrought miracles before his apostacy. (Calmet) --- Yet if any who had been so highly favoured, should attempt to enforce by their preceding miracles, any false doctrine, <i>let him be anathema,</i> Galatians i. 8. --- <i>Not.</i> The Hebrews had inconvertible proofs of the existence of one God. They could not therefore acknowledge any other. (Haydock) --- Novelty in religion is a mark of idolatry or of heresy. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:13:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Trieth you,</i> not in order to induce you to embrace evil, (James i. 13,) nor to discover your real dispositions, but to lay open your hearts to yourselves and to the world, (Haydock) that, if you continue steadfast, others may be encouraged to imitate you; but if you fall, they may take warning, and stand with all humility and circumspection. (Calmet) --- <i>Appear.</i> Hebrew, "to know, <i>or</i> to disclose." (Menochius)'
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:13:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Forger.</i> Hebrew, "dreamer," to whom God reveals his secrets in the night, as he does to the <i>prophet</i> while he is awake. --- <i>Slain.</i> Philo says, without any trial or delay; but the Rabbins allow that, although the impostor was not to receive an admonition, no ignorance being able to excuse him, as in other cases, he was to be brought before the Sanhedrim, at Jerusalem, and strangled. See Luke xiii. 33. The Jews, it is thought, condemned our Saviour on the plea that he was a false prophet, Matthew xxvi. 57. They commonly required before this condemnation, that a person should have assumed the character of a prophet, and not barely that he should have performed some wonderful work by his ingenuity. For if he only did the latter, and thereby endeavoured to withdraw the people from the service of the true God, he was punished as a seducer. They also refused to condemn one who had foretold evils, if they did not take place as was the case with Jonas and the Ninivites. (Haydock) --- But those who taught or did any thing contrary to the law, in quality of prophets, were in danger of condemnation, unless their great reputation might screen them from suspicion. Thus Elias offered sacrifice on Mount Carmel, without giving offence, 3 Kings xviii. 23. If a true prophet bore witness to another, the latter might also claim respect. (Calmet) --- Yet though St. John the Baptist had repeatedly commended Jesus Christ, the Jews did not hesitate to call him a <i>seducer,</i> and to put him to death. (Haydock) --- "<i>The evil</i> one," (Syriac,) 1 Corinthians v. 13.'
      v:006:
        - 'DEU:13:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>If thy</i> own <i>brother,</i> to distinguish him from the rest of the Jews, who were all styled brethren, as being descended from the same stock of the Patriarchs. (Menochius)'

        - 'DEU:13:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Presently put him to death.</i> Not by killing him by private authority, but by informing the magistrate, and proceeding by order of justice. (Challoner) (Worthington) --- Philo seems to assert the contrary. But he perhaps speaks of those who publicly endeavoured to lead the people astray. <i>Presently</i> is not in Hebrew. Other criminals were allowed twenty-four hours after condemnation. No delay was granted to false prophets. No excuse was admitted. If he had even been once acquitted, he might be examined again. --- <i>Thy hand.</i> The accuser or witness first threw a stone, after the wretch had been conducted out of the city, chap. xvii. 4., and Acts vii. 58.'
      v:012:
        - 'DEU:13:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Cities.</i> If the inhabitants agreed, in general, to introduce the worship of idols, they were to be first admonished, (Calmet) and if incorrigible, to be utterly destroyed. (Haydock) --- The obligation of seeing that this was executed, was left to the magistrates. (Du Hamel)'
      v:013:
        - 'DEU:13:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Belial:</i> that is, <i>without yoke.</i> Hence the wicked, who refuse to be subject to the divine law, are called in Scripture the sons of Belial. (Challoner) --- The devil is called Belial, or "an apostate, rebel," &c. The word is also applied to Antichrist, to idols, and to those who are notoriously wicked. (St. Jerome in Nahum i., and Isaias xxvii.; 3 Kings xxi. 13.)'
      v:015:
        - 'DEU:13:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Even the cattle.</i> Nothing at all must be spared. Yet the Rabbins and some who argue that penal laws must be restrained as much as possible, exempt the women, and boys under thirteen years of age, and understand this law only of the <i>central cities,</i> ver. 13. If the city was seduced by one man, or by women, or by people of a different tribe, the culprit was only to be stoned, and the Sanhedrim had to take cognizance of the whole affair. If many cities joined in the idolatry, or if any of them were cities of refuge, &c., they were not included. (Selden, Syned. iii. 5.; Grotius) --- But these limitations seem visibly to contradict the law. The goods of the innocent were involved in the common ruin, that they might learn to make all possible resistance to the introduction of so abominable a crime; and those of the guilty were destroyed wherever they were found. (Calmet) --- But the persons of those who fled away, to shew their disapprobation, and denounce the attempt of their brethren, (Haydock) would no doubt be saved. (Calmet) --- If they continued among them, their indolence or connivance deserved punishment. (Haydock) --- Grotius (Jur. ii. 15) maintains, that the magistrate is authorized by the law of nature to punish those who deny the existence of God or his Providence, as these errors strike at the root of all society. --- [<b>Ver. 16.</b>] <i>For the Lord,</i> as a victim of expiation, and to manifest your zeal for the honour of the only true God. --- <i>No more.</i> Septuagint, "it shall be uninhabited." The Rabbins are so exact, as to entertain a doubt whether the place might even be used as a garden. (Calmet)'
      v:017:

The Arabs and Saracens cut the hair on the forepart of the head only, and so did the ancient Scotch monks, in imitation, as they pretended, of St. John. The Egyptians cut off the hair of their head and eye-brows, when they were initiated in the mysteries of Isis, (St. Ambrose, ep. 58,) to testify that they partook in her sorrow for the death of her husband, Osiris. Hence, it is probable, that Moses forbids any conformity in such superstitious practices; particularly as the Israelites were consecrated to the service of the living God. (Calmet)'

(Bellon., q. 51.) <i>Dishon</i> means "ashes" in Hebrew. --- <i>Goat,</i> (<i>orygem</i>) "a wild goat, (Septuagint; Bochart; &c.) or ox." Aristotle allows it only one horn. Juvenal mentions that the Getulians feasted on its flesh; and the Egyptian priests, according to Horus, were allowed to eat it, without any scrupulous examination of the sealers. (Calmet) --- <i>Camelopardalus.</i> This animal resembles a camel in its head and longish neck, and the panther in the spotted skin.

The only difference is, that on the third and sixth years, the products were consumed on the spot, and in other years they were spent at Jerusalem. See Leviticus xxvii.

      v:024: 'DEU:14:24 | 24 | 24 | But when the way, and the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, are far off, and he hath blessed thee, and thou canst not carry all these things thither,'

      v:002:
        - 'DEU:15:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Again.</i> Hebrew does not mention <i>friend.</i> (Haydock) --- "He shall not exact it, (or urge) his neighbour or his brother, because," &c. Whence Cajetan gathers, that debts might be demanded after the expiration of the seventh year, on which the products of the earth did not enable the Jews to pay any thing. Grotius also asserts, that perpetual debts might be required; and Menoch, includes things <i>lent</i> under the same regulation. But all debts became extinct as soon as the seventh year commenced; (ver. 9.; Calmet) at least they could not be demanded till it was expired; though things merely lent, might be taken back. (Du Hamel)'
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:15:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Stranger,</i> who has not received circumcision. Such were entitled only to the common privileges of people in distress. They could not claim a share in the feasts, made out of the tithes of the Jews, &c. (Grotius)'
      v:004:
        - "DEU:15:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>There shall be no poor,</i> &c. It is not to be understood as <i>a promise,</i> that there should be no poor in Israel, as appears from ver. 11, where we learn that God's people would never be at a loss to find objects for their charity: but it is an ordinance that all should do their best endeavours to prevent any of their brethren from suffering the hardships of poverty and want. (Challoner) --- <i>Beggar,</i> is not expressed, though it be implied in Hebrew or the Septuagint, which connect this with the preceding verse, (Haydock) \"because (or save when) there shall be no poor among you;\" as if the rich could not derive the benefit from the remission of debts. (Vatable) --- God had made abundant provision for the poor. He might have prevented any from falling into distress. (Calmet) --- But he suffered this sometimes to take place, to try the dispositions both of the rich and of the poor. (Haydock) --- If they had faithfully complied with his laws, he would not have permitted them to fall into the last degree of misery. (Calmet) --- He allows no public begging, which all well regulated nations discountenance. (Menochius) --- The Jews carefully relieve their brethren. They gather alms, and one of the judges distributes what may be sufficient for the ensuing week. (Leo, p. i. c. 14.) --- Those who refused to give according to their abilities, were formerly ordered by the Sanhedrim to be scourged, till they had complied with their duty; and sometimes, things were taken forcibly from their houses. (Maimonides) --- They relieve the distressed in proportion to their former condition. (Selden, Jur. vi. 6.)"
      v:006:
        - "DEU:15:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Lend.</i> The Jews give a wrong interpretation to this passage, to authorize usury with regard to strangers. But God can never sanction injustice. He promises such riches to his people, if they be faithful, that they shall be in a condition to lend to many, without wanting themselves. (Calmet) --- <i>Over thee.</i> Hence the Jews submitted to a foreign yoke with so much reluctance. But they should have remembered to keep God's law. (Haydock)"
      v:008:
        - 'DEU:15:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Need of.</i> The Rabbins understand this of giving freely without any prospect of receiving again, much less of any advantage by usury. They esteem themselves bound also, by the laws of humanity, to assist even idolaters, though they will not beg of such, in public. Some assert, that they never allow public beggars among themselves, and indeed such are seldom to be seen. Yet no law forbids it; and Juvenal (vi. 541,) upbraids them with begging slyly at Rome. <i>Arcanum Judæa tremens mendicat in aurem.</i> (Calmet) --- If people be in extreme want, the law requires that necessaries should be given them; but if they be not so far reduced, but that they may be able to pay again in a little time, it may suffice to lend. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'DEU:15:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Eyes.</i> Hebrew, "and thy eye be evil against," &c. This expression denotes one who is a prey to the base passions of avarice, jealousy, envy, &c., chap. xxviii. 54., and Matthew xx. 15. (Calmet) --- <i>A sin,</i> or draw on punishment. (Menochius) --- "If thou hast not fed, thou hast killed" thy neighbour in extreme want. (St. Ambrose, Off. ii. 7.) (Worthington)'
      v:010:

      v:011:
        - 'DEU:15:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Needy.</i> Hebrew expresses the order to be observed in giving alms, "open thy hand wide (give with profusion) to thy brother, (or relations) to thy needy, (in extreme want) and to thy poor in the land," whoever they may be. (Calmet) --- To exercise the charity of his people, God suffered some to be poor. (Worthington)'
      v:012:
        - 'DEU:15:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Free.</i> The Hebrews might sell themselves only to their own countrymen; and the judges might condemn those who had committed a theft, and had not wherewith to make restitution, to be sold to their brethren. See Exodus xxi. 2.'

        - 'DEU:15:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Way.</i> Hebrew literally, "Thou shalt put round his neck, (<i>or</i> furnish him abundantly) out of thy flock," &c. This is not specified in the Book of Exodus.'
      v:017:
        - 'DEU:15:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>House,</i> before a judge. It is supposed that this law regarded only those who had sold themselves, or had been condemned to be slaves. (Fagius) --- <i>For ever;</i> that is, till the year of jubilee. --- <i>Also,</i> not by piercing her ear, as some have thought, but by setting her at liberty, and giving her something, ver. 14.'
      v:018:
        - 'DEU:15:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Hireling.</i> His freedom is due to him, as much as wages are due to the hireling. He is alse entitled to a decent provision, for which he has laboured. Hebrew, "he hath been worth twice as much to thee as a hired servant," by his greater diligence, labour, and fidelity. Servitude has also rendered his worth doubly severe. (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - 'DEU:15:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Firstlings.</i> Some belonged to the priests. Others, of which Moses speaks here, might be disposed of by the owners, chap. xii. 17. (Calmet) --- Thus females, which came first, belonged to them, but they could not <i>work</i> with them; (Menochius) with such at least as were the best, and fattened for a religious feast. Sheep designed for this purpose were not to be shorn; or, as the original term means, their wool was not to be "torn away." Bellon observes, that this is still the custom in some parts of the East, as it was formerly in Italy, according to Varro. Pliny ([Natural History?] viii. 48,) also remarks, that fleece was torn off in some places, (Calmet) and the same method is said to prevail still in Shetland. (Haydock)'
      v:022:
        - 'DEU:15:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Unclean.</i> This shews, that they could not be peace-offerings. (Menochius) (Chap. xiii. 15.) (Calmet)'

      v:010: 'DEU:15:10 | 10 | 10 | But thou shalt give to him: neither shalt thou do any thing craftily in relieving his necessities: that the Lord thy God may bless thee at all times, and in all things to which thou shalt put thy hand.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'DEU:16:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Corn.</i> Hebrew <i>abib,</i> "green ears of corn," when barley begins to ripen, and wheat is yet green in Palestine; at the time of the year, which corresponds with half of our March and April. The Chaldeans called this month <i>Nisan,</i> "of the standards;" because the armies then left their winter quarters. The first-fruits of the barley harvest were offered on the second day of the paschal solemnity, Leviticus xxiii. 10., and Exodus xiii. 4. (Calmet) --- <i>Night.</i> We read (Exodus xii. 22., and Numbers xxxiii. 3,) that the Hebrews were ordered not to leave their houses till morning, and that they departed from Ramesses on the day after the passage of the destroying angel. They began, therefore, to prepare for their journey on the <i>evening</i> of the 14th, and began their march at day-break on the 15th of Nisan, ver. 6. Their departure may be considered in its different stages: <b>1.</b> Of eating the paschal lamb, with their staves in their hands; <b>2.</b> of being urged by the Egyptians to depart, at midnight; <b>3.</b> of their leaving their respective homes, to meet all together at Ramesses; and lastly, [<b>4.</b>] of their beginning their march from that place to leave Egypt. They did not, however, quit the confines till they had passed the Red Sea, which took place effectually in the <i>night,</i> Exodus xiv. 20, 24. (Haydock) --- Thus they departed in the evening, at night, in the morning, and in the open day. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'DEU:16:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Phase.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "the Phase (or lamb) to the Lord thy God, sheep and oxen," or "of the flock and the herd," (Protestants) offered on the same festival, (Haydock) or victims proper for the solemnity, besides the paschal lamb, Numbers xxviii. 19., and 2 Paralipomenon xxx. 15. Peace-offerings were also made; (Leviticus vi. 12., and 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 7,) and of these free offerings, some explain the words of the Jews, (John xviii. 28,) as they suppose the lamb had been eaten the night before. (Menochius; Bochart; Tirinus) --- They might, however, have refrained from eating of these on that day. (Calmet) --- But they perhaps did not choose to be debarred of that privilege. --- <i>There.</i> The place peculiarly consecrated to the worship of God, for length of days. (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:16:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Affliction.</i> Hebrew also, "of poverty." Syriac, "of humility." Septuagint, "of evil treatment;" or such bread as the poorest sort of people and slaves are forced to eat. The Jews serve the bread in small pieces, to denote their former poverty. This unleavened bread is also less palatable, and less wholesome. --- <i>Fear.</i> Septuagint, "in haste," Exodus xii. 11. The psalmist (Psalm civ. 43,) mentions, the <i>exultation and joy</i> of the Hebrews, but it was mixed with fear, lest they should lose so great a benefit.'
      v:006:
        - 'DEU:16:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Phase,</i> or paschal lamb, which was to be sacrificed <i>between the two evenings,</i> during the space of about four hours, in the court before the ark. Some think that this precept was binding only in times of peace; and that when the people could not assemble in the place appointed, they might sacrifice the lamb elsewhere, which seems very probable, though no positive proof can be adduced. In the reign of Amon, when the priests could not perform their sacred functions in the temple, they removed the ark to another place: but Josias caused it to be brought back, 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 3. (Calmet) --- As the Jews have now no temple, they cannot sacrifice the paschal lamb. (Tirinus) --- The priests were very expert, and observed an admirable order in offering such a surprising multitude of victims, (Calmet) as would be offered by every family of ten people. (Haydock) --- The blood, and perhaps the fat also, was presented on the altar of holocausts, which was very large, and the court exceedingly spacious. (Calmet) --- <i>Which.</i> This may not signify the precise hour, but may refer to all the time while the Hebrews were preparing for and commencing their journey. (Menochius) Ver. 1. --- Hebrew, "at the (return of the) season in which," &c.'
      v:007:
        - 'DEU:16:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Dress,</i> (<i>coques</i>.) Hebrew <i>bashal</i> means frequently, to <i>boil,</i> and sometimes to <i>roast,</i> as it must here, if it refer to the paschal lamb; the other victims might however be boiled, and the Septuagint use both expressions, "Thou shalt boil and roast." See 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 13. It seems that Moses speaks only of the lamb, the method of preparing which he had abundantly explained before. (Calmet) --- Hebrew has not <i>it,</i> and of course the passage may be understood of all the victims offered on this solemnity. On the <i>morning</i> after it was concluded, people might all depart to their respective homes. The Rabbins observe, that they could not do this on the morning of the 15th Nisan, as it was a solemn festival, on which long journeys were prohibited, and they ought to wait till the end of the seventh day, to make their offering. Under Ezechias and Josias, the people appear to have continued together during the whole octave, 2 Paralipomenon xxx., and xxxv. 17. (Haydock) --- Others are of opinion that the people might retire home after the 15th, (Tostat) or in the morning after they had eaten the paschal lamb. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - 'DEU:16:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Six days</i> after the solemn day is ended, or in all seven (Exodus xiii. 7.; Calmet); or the seventh day is here remarkable, for some particular distinction. (Menochius) --- <i>Assembly.</i> Hebrew, " the feast of prohibition, or of withholding," or rather the festival day, in which all must make their appearance, to do homage to their Lord, Leviticus xxiii. 36. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "on the 7th is the dismission, (<i>or</i> termination) a feast to the Lord." (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'DEU:16:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Corn:</i> that is, from the 16th of Nisan, (Menochius) the second day of the paschal solemnity, on which new barley was presented before the Lord, as new wheat was on the second day of Pentecost, Leviticus xxiii. 10.'
      v:010:
        - 'DEU:16:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Hand.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "as much as thy hand is able;" an offering, bearing a due proportion with what God has bestowed upon thee. (Haydock) --- Each one was exhorted to make peace-offerings and feasts, at Jerusalem, in honour of God, ver. 11. On these festival days the <i>first-born,</i> fattened animals, were brought to be slain, chap. xii. 17., and xiv. 23. The Jews think that by these feasts their solemnities are very much honoured. But the intention of the lawgiver, was only to keep them at a distance from the profane rejoicings of the pagans, and to raise their thoughts and their hearts, by degrees, to the more solid spiritual delights. There were, however, too much inclined to stop at the gratification of the senses, and understood in that sense the <i>sabbath,</i> which Isaias (lviii. 13,) calls <i>delightful,</i> or delicate. (Buxt., Syn. x.)'
      v:012:
        - 'DEU:16:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Commanded,</i> in gratitude for past favours.'
      v:015:
        - 'DEU:16:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>In joy.</i> Hebrew adds, "surely, <em>or</em> wholly." Hence the Rabbins esteem it unlawful to marry on these days, lest they should blend sacred and worldly joy together.'
      v:016:
        - 'DEU:16:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Empty.</i> All were bound to make some offering, which was left to their option, and thus the festivity was much increased, by the abundance of all things; so that all might find a particular pleasure in being present at these feasts, even though they were not influenced by sentiments of piety and of religion. See Exodus xxiii. 15. (Calmet) --- While the masters of families were from home, <i>thrice in the year,</i> God protected their houses and children from the incursions of enemies, so that they were never more secure. (Sanctius) (Tirinus)'
      v:018:
        - 'DEU:16:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Magistrates,</i> (<i>magistros,</i>) "masters;" people learned in the law, who may assist the judges with their counsel in any emergency. Hebrew <i>shotrim,</i> "officers, heralds, lictors," &c., chap. i. 15. (Haydock) --- Bonfrere (in Exodus xviii. 25,) thinks that these were the judges set over each tribe, or else the assessors of the judges. (Menochius) --- The Rabbins mention three tribunals of the Jews: <b>1.</b> The Sanhedrim, consisting of seventy judges, with a prince at the head of them; <b>2.</b> the twenty-three judges, who resided in considerable cities; <b>3.</b> the tribunal of three judges, who administered justice in the villages, which had not above 120 inhabitants. But Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. last chapter.) only mentions, that Moses established in each city seven judges, who had each two officers of the tribe of Levi. --- <i>Gates,</i> where the judges sat.'
      v:019:
        - 'DEU:16:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Just.</i> Avarice is like a cloud, (Calmet) which darkens the understanding. <i>Oppression troubleth the wise, and</i> (Hebrew) "a present destroyeth the <i>heart.</i>" A timid or interested judge is unfit for his office. Sir Thomas More was very careful not to receive presents, while he was high chancellor of England. (Haydock) --- If even the just are in danger of being perverted by presents, what must we think of others? (Du Hamel)'
      v:020:
        - 'DEU:16:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Just.</i> Hebrew, "thou shalt follow justice." Thou shalt be guided solely by the dictates of justice, in passing sentence, Exodus xxiii. 1, 9. (Calmet) --- That judge who passes sentence according to truth, executes his office unjustly if he be actuated by the love of a temporal reward. (St. Gregory, mor. 9.)'
      v:021:
        - 'DEU:16:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Tree.</i> The pagans had consecrated different sorts of trees to their idols. They always planted groves near their temples, to increase the reverential awe, and but too often to hide the abominations which were there committed. The Hebrews frequently imitated them in these particulars. Yet Hecateus observes, that no tree was to be seen near the temple of Jerusalem.'
      v:022:
        - "DEU:16:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Statue.</i> Hebrew <i>matseba,</i> means also a pillar, monument, heap of stones, image, title, &c., Genesis xxviii. --- <i>Hateth,</i> when they are designed for superstitious purposes. On other occasions, statues and pictures may be very instructive and commendable. (Haydock) --- The patriarchs set up pillars, altars, &c., as did also the Israelites, (Josue xxii. 10.) Samuel, &c., even after this prohibition, and without any offence. The Rabbins allow, that the proselytes of justice do well in erecting such monuments of religion, provided they be not intended for false worship. (Selden, Jur. ii. 6.) (Calmet) --- How blind then must be our dissenting brethren, who cannot make this easy and obvious distinction, but indiscriminately condemn all Catholics as guilty of idolatry, because they make and keep in their chapels, and bow down before images of the saints. This trifling objection is pressed with great vigour by J. Wesley, the founder of the Methodists. \"The Papists, says he, set up their idols in their churches---they worship the picture of the Queen of heaven---they idolize a dead man or woman.\" To whom Dr. Parker, a Protestant bishop, replies: (Disc. for the Abrog. of the Test.) \"Yet, after all, we have no other ground for the bold conceit, than the crude and rash assertions of some <i>popular divines,</i> who have no other measures of truth and zeal, but their hatred of popery....As to the use of images in the worship of God, I cannot but admire at the confidence of these men, to make so bold a charge against them in general, when the images of the cherubim were commanded by God himself, Exodus xxv. 22. They were the most solemn and sacred part of the Jewish religion, and therefore, though images, so far from idolatry, that God made them the seat of his presence, and from between them delivered his oracles. This instance is so plain and obvious to every reader,....that it is a much greater wonder to me that those men, who advance the objection of idolatry so groundlessly, (<i>against</i> the greater <i>part of Christendom,</i> as he observed before) can so slightly rid themselves of so pregnant a proof against it.\" See an answer to the Rev. J. Wesley's <i>Misrepresentations,</i> &c., by the Rev. N. G. published at Whitby, 1811, where some of the variations in doctrine of the <i>pillars</i> of Methodism, are also briefly noticed, as well as the absurdity of a man setting up for a reformer of religion, who at the time did not believe in Christ, (Journal ii. p. 102-3,) and for forty-two years afterwards preached a doctrine either Popish (Jour. for 1739) or Antinomian, than which, to use the words of his own recantation, \"<i>nothing could be more false.</i>\" (Minutes of a Conference, 1770.) It may not be improper to observe, that in the last great deluge of error, the Methodist Society began, 1st May, 1738, at London, though it had a more obscure beginning at Oxford, 1729, and another at Havannah, 1736. Yet even when this third grand attempt was made to spread it wider, and to rectify former mistakes, the author acknowledges that he was not converted, no not till many days afterwards, when, being in a <i>Lutheran</i> society! (26th May) \"an assurance, says he, was given me, that Christ had taken away my sins, even mine;\" (Journal) and still, in the year 1770, he had to \"review the whole affair.\" Such is the man who has deluded so many thousands! <i>Out of thy own mouth will I condemn thee.</i> Surely those who wilfully follow such blind guides, deserve to fall into the ditch. What confidence now can the Methodists have in the interpretations which Wesley has given them of the Scriptures, since he stumbled in broad daylight; and even preached for above thirty years together, that the observance of God's law is not only unnecessary, but <i>sinful,</i> an error to which he was forced, at last, to open his eyes by the scandalous immoralities of several of his deluded admirers, whom he had been all along foolishly flattering with the assurance that <i>faith alone</i> would ensure their salvation. Strange it may appear, that he should not be put on his guard by the fall of Luther, who split against the same rock, and scrupled not to condemn the Epistle of St. James as not worth a straw, <i>stramineam epistolam,</i> an expression for which he is said afterwards to have been sorry, as Wesley was for the doctrine which he had been delivering for so many years. But the evil was then done. Multitudes had been deceived by these arch impostors. Their surviving followers might however, if they would, derive this lesson from their tardy repentance and recantation, to examine with more caution their other doctrines, which they have delivered with the like confidence; and as they have reason to fear the yielding an implicit belief to such innovators, so they may be induced to flee to <i>the ark,</i> the true Catholic Church, that they may be protected from <i>the contradiction of tongues,</i> Psalm xxx. 21. (St. Augustine, ibid.) \"After Christ and the gospel, we have no farther enquiry to make.\" (Tertullian) --- We know that novelty in religion is a sure mark of falsehood, as no one can place any other foundation besides that which has been fixed by the beginner and finisher of our faith. From the written and unwritten <i>Word of God,</i> we learn what He has taught, and among the rest, we are authorized to keep holy pictures with respect. This is not an attempt against the worship of God, but designed to promote it. We do not make them to <i>ourselves,</i> without a divine authority. The same things which we are not allowed to <i>adore,</i> we must not <i>make.</i> Yet Methodists have and make pictures. We have God's will clearly expressed to us by his Church, which he has commanded us to hear and obey. If we be led astray by so doing, we may at least plead that we did, to the best of our judgment, as we were ordered by God; which those, who choose for themselves, cannot do. If this Church, so strongly recommended to us in Scripture, be capable of deceiving us in an affair of so great consequence as in that of idolatry, to what article of the Christian revelation can we yield our assent with safety? So, on the other hand, if Luther and Wesley have grossly imposed on their followers, by teaching them to believe that Catholics are idolaters, and that faith alone is necessary for salvation, as they are <i>self-convicted</i> in the latter point, how can their disciples forget the old proverb, \"A liar is not believed even when he speaks the truth;\" and consequently, how can they take up their faith on their bare word, though they may pretend to ground their doctrine on the word of God? They confessedly misapplied that sacred word, with respect to faith alone, and they shut their eyes to the obvious meaning of the texts which forbid graven things. Ought not, therefore, the unlearned and the unstable to dread lest they may have <i>wrested</i> the other Scriptures to their own perdition? (2 Peter iii. 16.) See Exodus xx. This subject is of such vast importance, the accusation of idolatry is of so black a nature, that it deserves to be accurately and frequently refuted. It is not an accusation brought only by a few obscure individuals, who have not the power to do any great harm by it; the most exalted dignitaries of the Protestant church, such as Dr. Shute, of Durham, in two charges to his clergy, the most famous modern reformers, like Wesley, &c., have not scrupled to repeat the calumny; and the Legislature has, for many years, been actuated by what they perhaps have thought a pious zeal, to exterminate the imitators of the Chanaanites! They may have listened too attentively to the intolerant institutor of the love-feasts, (who seems, nevertheless, to threaten the overthrow of the established church) and who, in the excess of his zeal, exclaims, \"I insist upon it that no government, not Roman Catholic, ought to tolerate men of the Roman Catholic persuasion.\" (Letter written 1780, a short time before the riots.) They must then be murdered, banished, or forced into the church, that <i>little society</i> which began in the <i>evening</i> of the 1st of May, 1738, in Fetter-lane; (Journal i.) for Methodists assert, that the God of this world <i>has hitherto triumphed over every revival of true religion,</i> (Dedic. prefixed to the Life of J. Wesley, by Drs. Coke and Moore) and consequently over the reformed Church of England; so that they can hardly insist, that we should embrace her doctrine, and thus increase the triumph of the devil. We have therefore no alternative left, but either to abandon our country or our religion. These are the apostles, worthy of Mahomet, who would have us believe that they are inspired by the Holy Ghost, and divinely commissioned to raise <i>another holy temple out of the scattered lively stones of that</i> once beautiful building, which was erected by Jesus Christ, against which they say (Ibid.) <i>the gates of hell have never</i> <b>wholly</b> <i>prevailed.</i> These are the <i>teachers</i> whom they have heaped up to <i>themselves, having itching ears,</i> 2 Timothy iv. 3. These are the interpreters of the sacred oracles! Both Wesley and Coke have, at least, acquired great celebrity with their adherents, by their labours in this way; but how much their explications may be depended upon, we may form some judgment from the preceding remarks. The character of bishop, which Dr. Coke extorted from the hands of his great master, 10th of Sept. 1784, at Bristol, will not give us any higher idea of the sagacity of either. It disgusted all thinking men, as a similar action of Luther, a fallen priest, consecrating a bishop had done long before. Mr. Charles Wesley upon hearing of his brother having ordained a bishop, being but a presbyter himself, is said to have exclaimed,{JOIN}{BQ:1}\"So easily are bishops made, by man's or woman's whim;{JOIN}{BQ:1}Wesley his hands on Coke has laid---but who laid hands on him?\"{JOIN}See Nightingale, &c., for further information on Methodism, which now makes such a noise, though its novelty, variations, acknowledged mistakes, calumnies, spirit of persecution, want of lawful pastors, &c., here briefly instanced, might suffice to put people upon their guard.

Job (xxxi. 26, 28) takes notice of the adoration of the sun and of the moon, and calls it <i>a very great iniquity, and a denial against the most high God.</i> He lived in Arabia, and probably not far from the place where Moses was addressing the Israelites. (Haydock) --- The pagans looked upon the sun and moon as the king and queen of heaven, and the stars as their guards. Plato says (in Phædro) that "the sun marches at the head of the gods, in a winged chariot, and the eleven other gods lead on their bands of demons," or the stars, &c.'

When a city was infected with this abomination, it was wholly destroyed. But no one was punished, except two witnesses (ver. 6,) attested that formal idolatry, by sacrifice, &c., had been committed.

Maimonides asserts, that the execution took place on some great festival, for the terror and instruction of the multitude; but others call this in question. (Fagius) (Calmet)'

        - 'DEU:17:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>If thou perceive,</i> &c. Here we see what authority God was pleased to give to the church-guides of the Old Testament, in deciding, without appeal, all controversies relating to the law; promising that they should not err therein; and punishing with death such as proudly refused to obey their decisions: and surely he has not done less for the church-guides of the New Testament. (Challoner) --- <i>Hard.</i> Hebrew also means, "doubtful, hidden, divided;" so that the opinions of the judges do not agree. In matters of fact, the thing is more easily investigated on the spot. But in these cases, where the law is ambiguous, as even the divine ordinances frequently are, being delivered in human language, (Grotius) a living judge is necessary. God remits the Jews in the council of the priests, at the head of whom was the sovereign pontiff, who was the natural and supreme judge of such difficulties, ver. 9, 12. (Haydock) --- <i>And blood,</i> to decide when murder must be punished with death, and when the right of an asylum may be claimed. (Calmet) --- The Vulgate renders the same words, 2 Paralipomenon xix. 10. --- <i>Between kindred and kindred,</i> as the different degrees cause many embarrassments, with regard to marriages, &c. (Tirinus) --- The Rabbins understand that the judge had to declare when a woman was rendered unclean, Leviticus xii. 4. (Lyranus) --- <i>And cause,</i> or lawsuit; some thinking that a greater sum for reparation of an injury should be required, others judging that one of the contending parties should be set at liberty, while the other judges are of a contrary sentiment. Hebrew, "between judgment and judgment," when a doubt arises whether laymen or the Levites may be the proper judges. The Rabbins only remit three cases to the tribunal of the latter, respecting, <b>1.</b> The red heifer; <b>2.</b> the woman accused of adultery by her jealous husband; <b>3.</b> the heifer to be offered in sacrifice, for a murder committed by a person unknown, chap. xxi. 5. --- <i>And leprosy.</i> Various difficulties might arise concerning this matter, of which the priests had to pass sentence, Leviticus xiii. Some render the Hebrew <i>negah,</i> "wound." The law of retaliation required a scrupulous nicety. <i>Blood, cause, and leprosy,</i> may denote lawsuits of a criminal, less important, and ceremonial nature. (Jansenius) --- <i>Vary.</i> Hebrew, "<i>which are</i> matters of contention within thy gates."'
      v:009:
        - 'DEU:17:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Judge.</i> Moses does not specify whether the contending parties, or the judges themselves thought proper to have the matter debated before a higher court. The Rabbins observe, that appeals to the Sanhedrim were only the last resort, and that the sentence of that tribunal was to be complied with under pain of death, ver. 12. (Selden, Syned. iii. 2. 2.) The judge here mentioned, according to them and the generality of commentators, after Josephus, Philo, &c., is no other than the high priest, as the Scripture plainly indicates, chap. xxi. 5., and Ezechiel xliv. 24. He abode near the tabernacle, and God enabled him to explain the law, when he was arrayed with the ephod, and the Urim and Thummim. Some moderns, who have an interest to lessen the authority of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, with Calvin, Ainsworth, &c., pretend that an appeal was to be made to the priests, in disputes which concerned religion, and to the civil magistrate in other cases, 2 Paralipomenon xix. 5. (Calmet) --- But an appeal to the high priest, in doubtful cases, could not be denied. The government of the Jews was a theocracy, and the pontiff acted as the vicegerent of God. (Haydock)'

        - "DEU:17:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>According,</i> &c. This law was to be the rule of the priests, in passing sentence. It was not left to the judgment of individuals to comply or not, according as they might explain the law for themselves. Such a proceeding would be nugatory, as they would thus be themselves the ultimate judges of their own cause. (Haydock) --- <i>They shall seek the law at his</i> (the priest's) <i>mouth,</i> Malachias ii. 7. Protestants make, therefore, a very frivolous restriction, when they allow his sentence to bind only \"so long as he is the true minister of God, and pronounceth according to his word.\" (Bible, 1603.) (Worthington) --- If any had been proud enough among the Jews, to persuade himself that he understood the law better than the high priest, he would not on that account have escaped death. (Haydock) --- The authority of the Christian Church is not inferior to that of the Synagogue, only, \"instead of death, excommunication is now inflicted\" on the rebellious. (St. Gregory, Matthew xviii. 17.; St. Augustine, q. 38.) In effect, St. Paul assures us that the priests of the law, <i>serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. But now he</i> (Christ)<i>...is the mediator of the better covenant, which is established on better promises,</i> Hebrews viii. 5, 6. If therefore the privilege of deciding points of faith and morality, without danger of mistake, was granted to the synagogue, can any one doubt but that Christ would provide as ample a security for his Church, with which he has promised to <i>remain for ever,</i> and with his <i>Holy Spirit</i> to <i>teach</i> her <i>all</i> the <i>truth</i>? (Haydock) --- St. Augustine dwells upon this argument (Doct. 4.) and proves the infallibility both of the Jewish and of the Christian Church. Hence Christ said, with respect to the former, which was not yet rejected, <i>All therefore whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do: but according to their works, do ye not: for they say</i> the truth, <i>and do not</i> practise what they require of others. If the heads of the Catholic Church should be equally immoral, their true doctrine must not therefore be despised, lest Christ and his Father be at the same time <i>despised.</i> For this is the express admonition of our heavenly lawgiver, <i>hear the Church:</i> (Matthew xvii. 17,) and this he does not require without giving us a full assurance, that we may do it without fear of being led astray. The sole command of God implies as much, if he had said no more. For can he order us to sin? The pretended reformers, who blushed not to make this blasphemous assertion, might easily swallow down the other, respecting the defection and fallibility of the whole Church; and might even believe, that the <i>whole world had been drowned in abominable idolatry for eight hundred years and more.</i> (Hom. on the peril of idolat. p. 3.) How much <i>more</i> they do not determine, lest they should be forced to tell when the religion of the Catholics began, and that they will never do without dating from Christ and the apostles, the foundations of the only true Church. (Haydock) --- The Jews had such a respect for the decisions of their Rabbins, in consequence of this command of God, that some hesitate not to assert, that if one of them should declare that the left hand was the right, they would believe him; and they condemn the refractory to most grievous torments in hell. (Buxtorf., Syn. i.) --- We must shew the most profound submission to the decrees of the Church. (Calmet) --- Yet we are not bound to assent to the decisions of every teacher. Only, when the Church speaks, we must not refuse to obey, nor pretend to appoint ourselves judges of what she teaches. A private doctor, however eminent, may fall into some absurdities, but the major part of the pastors of the Church, with the Pope at their head, never can. In vain have the records of nineteen centuries been ransacked, to find a single instance of such a general agreement in error. If the Synagogue passed a wicked sentence upon Jesus Christ, we must reflect that the forms here required (ver. 8,) were neglected; and it was then <i>expiring,</i> and giving place to a <i>better covenant,</i> as the prophets had foretold. Yet even in that sentence, which was so unjust on the part of Caiphas, St. John (xi. 51.) acknowledges the truth of God. <i>And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest, that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation, and not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God that were dispersed.</i> The Synagogue could claim submission no longer, after the great prophet had come to abrogate the law of fear, and to substitute that of love. Hence while he was there to teach himself, (Hebrews i. 2,) there was no danger of deception for the people. But the covenant which he has established is to last for ever: no prophet or lawgiver is promised to introduce any change, or greater perfection, so that no one can plead for an excuse of his rebellion, that the Church may deceive and pass an erroneous judgment; or, if he do, he must be cut off from the society of the faithful, by the spiritual sword; and, dying in that state, without the Church for his mother, he need never expect that God will acknowledge him for his son. See St. Cyprian, Unity of the Catholic Church. If an individual pastor should pass such a perverse sentence, the case would be very different. Yet, even in such trying cases, an humble conduct will be the best security and proof of innocence, and God will reward those who have suffered unjustly. (Haydock)"

        - 'DEU:17:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>King.</i> The Rabbins observe, that one was to be elected before the place for the temple was fixed upon, that the tribes might not contend about that honour. (Grotius) --- God foresees that the people will insist upon having a king, and gives his consent, reserving to himself the choice, and appointing laws for him, that he may not forget that he is only the lieutenant of the most high. Yet God testified his displeasure, when the Israelites demanded a king, because they did it in a seditious manner, so as to reject the prophet Samuel, whom he had given them for a ruler, in whom they could discover no fault. (Calmet) (1 Kings viii. 7., and x. 19.)'
      v:015:
        - "DEU:17:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Choose,</i> as he did Saul, David, and Solomon, who succeeded to the throne of his father, though he was not the eldest son. (Menochius) --- Then the throne began to be hereditary, in virtue of God's promise to David. (Calmet) --- <i>Brother.</i> The Jews neglected this law, when they willingly recognized the authority of Herod, two years after the birth of Christ. See Genesis xlix. 10. (Haydock) --- A stranger might attempt to draw off the people from the service of the true God, and mutual love would not so easily subsist between them. (Menochius)"
      v:016:
        - 'DEU:17:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Horses.</i> Josue and David rendered the captured horses useless, (Josue xi. 6., and 2 Kings viii. 4,) and the judges rode on asses, Judges x. 4., and xii. 14. Solomon began to keep some, and in his days Egypt was noted for the traffic of horses; though, after Sesostris had intersected the country with canals, they were more neglected. (Marsham, Canon. sæc. xiii., and xiv.) God did not wish his people to engage in the tumults of war, nor would he permit their king to be puffed up with his own strength, Psalm xix. 8., and xxxii. 17. Philo says he would not have them to listen to any who might promise to conduct them to a better country, and thus teach them to lead a wandering life. (Calmet) --- He precludes also the attempt to conquer Egypt. Hebrew, "he shall not make the people return to Egypt, in order that he may multiply horses," by their buying them for him in that country, 3 Kings x. 29. --- <i>Way.</i> When the people proposed returning, God severely punished them, Numbers xiv. 5.'
      v:017:
        - 'DEU:17:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Mind,</i> and reign in his name. Hebrew, "and his heart turn not away" from the worship of the true God, as it happened to Solomon, and to many other kings, whom Moses seems to have had in view. Too great a number of wives would tend to perplex and enervate the king, and to eat up the treasures of his people. The Jewish lawyers allow the king only 18, and they say David and Roboam had that number. But the latter had moreover 60 concubines, (2 Paralipomenon xi. 21,) and Solomon had many more. In effect, the number seems not to be restricted, and, what is very singular, the Rabbins allow all but the high priest and the king as many as they can keep, though the sages advise people to have no more than four, which seems to be the sentiment of the Mahometans. This liberty was taken by the Jews till the emperors restricted them, A.D. 593. (Selden, Uxor. i. 8, &c.) Plurality of wives was not formerly a sin, though Solomon offended by too great excess. (St. Augustine, q. 27.) (Worthington) --- <i>Gold.</i> Immense riches are seldom possessed even by kings, without the oppression of their subjects, and great danger of falling into extravagance. If David amassed so much gold, it was destined for the building of the temple. But Solomon laying on heavy taxes, alienated the hearts of his people, and gave occasion to the revolt of 10 tribes; and Ezechias brought on a severe chastisement by making a parade of his treasures to the ambassadors of the king of Babylon, 4 Kings xx. 15. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - "DEU:17:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Of this law,</i> perhaps from the 14th verse to the end of the chapter, (Haydock) or the whole Book of Deuteronomy, which contains an abridgment of the law, (Josue viii. 32.; Menochius) or even the five books, which were formerly written without any division, and went under the name of the law. (Grotius; &c.) --- Hebrew seems favourable to this last opinion, (Calmet) \"he shall write a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is kept by the priests,\" unless Moses might only require that he should have a copy of what he was then delivering. (Haydock) --- Some say that the king was obliged to take two copies, one of which he was to have always about him. It is not certain whether he was obliged to write himself, as Philo asserts, or another might do it for him. The diadem and the law were presented to Joas, when he ascended the throne, 2 Paralipomenon xxiii. 11. (Calmet) --- If (Haydock) Josias had not seen a copy of the law before the 18th year of his reign, this precept must have been very ill observed, 4 Kings xxii. 11. (Calmet) --- But, very probably, that book, which Helcias discovered in the temple, was the autograph of Moses, and therefore made a deeper impression upon all who saw and heard it read, than if it had been read than if it had been only an ordinary copy. This copy might have been mislaid or secreted in those troublesome times; and then the high priest brought it to light again, he as well as the king and all the people, were filled with joy and amazement. (Haydock) --- It was the custom of the Jews to present a copy of the law to their kings, when they first sat upon the throne; and hence, perhaps, they make a similar present to the Pope, when he goes to take possession of the Lateran church. (Morus.) --- They presented one to Innocent II when he made his entry into Paris, 1146, and another to king Louis the Fat, as Suger informs us. (Calmet) --- <i>Priests.</i> Temporal princes who desire to become virtuous and wise, will ever take the law of God at the priest's hands. (Worthington)"
      v:019:
        - 'DEU:17:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Law.</i> Pious Christian emperors and kings have esteemed it their greatest glory and happiness to read and meditate on the holy commandments of God, in order to regulate their conduct, amid the various dangerous occupations of their station. (Haydock) --- Constantine the Great, Charlemagne, St. Stephen of Hungary, Alphonsus I of Spain, were noted for the zeal which they shewed in this particular. Alphonsus of Arragon, had read the Bible, with the Commentaries, 14 times over, and the great Alfred wrote all the New Testament twice over with his own hand. (Calmet) --- He had translated into English Saxon all or most of the Bible before 900, as king Athelstan did about 925. (Encyclopedia Britannica, Bible, &c.) Yet the Catholic Church never condemned this conduct of her children, as Protestants would insinuate. (Cath. Doct. by N. G.)'
      v:020:
        - 'DEU:17:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>With pride.</i> This is not expressed in Hebrew, but it is clearly (Haydock) implied. Humility is the most difficult virtue for a prince to practice, amid the flattery of his courtiers, and the splendour with which he is environed. See St. Augustine, City of God v. 24. (Calmet) --- <i>His sons.</i> Wicked kings seldom left a quiet possession of the throne to their heirs. (Menochius) --- David and his posterity reigned in succession, by an effect of the divine bounty. (Calmet)'

The priests shall have the parts of the sacrifices for peace allotted to them, &c., tithes shall be given to support the Levites. (Haydock) --- These parts are what God claims from the people, as their Sovereign, (Calmet) and these he assigns to his ministers. Septuagint, "The fruits of the Lord are their inheritance, they shall eat them." (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:18:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Due,</i> (<i>judicium</i>.) Moses only mentions a part, having explained the rest, Exodus xxix. 27., Leviticus vii. 32. --- <i>Breast,</i> (<i>ventriculum.</i>) In the other places <i>pectusculum</i> occurs. Hebrew, "the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the maw, <i>or</i> caul," called in Latin <i>omasum,</i> being the last and fattest of the four ventricles, and highly esteemed by the ancients. The cheeks or chaps are specified no where else; so that some think Moses here supplies what he had left imperfect, assigning to the priests the cheeks and the tongue. Jansenius supposes that this is only a part of the breast, which appears to have two cheeks when the shoulders are cut off. But Moses here probably speaks not of the peace-offerings, but of the beasts which were killed by the Israelites at home for their own uses, &c., (Clerc) as Philo explains it, (de præm.) and Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. 4) only specifies the right shoulder and the breast, which were given to the priests on these occasions. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "the shoulder, the cheeks, and the last ventricle." The victims were not, therefore, of a sacred nature; as they were only sacrificed, inasmuch as the blood was to be offered to the Lord. (Haydock) See Genesis xliii. 16.'

        - 'DEU:18:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Levite.</i> In the days of Moses, all the Levites probably assisted in the service of the tabernacle, when they thought proper. But, after they should be dispersed, he encourages them to come willingly. David afterwards divided the priests and the Levites into classes, which were obliged to serve in their turns, 1 Paralipomenon xxiii., &c. Though he derogated from the words of the law, he followed the spirit of the injunction, which was intended to promote the great glory and decency of religion; and even after this regulation, (Calmet) those who desired, like Samuel, (Menochius) to consecrate their labours to the Lord for life, or for a long time, were in all probability entitled to the privileges here granted. (Calmet)'

        - 'DEU:18:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Fire.</i> This impiety is not punished with death, (Leviticus xviii. 21,) as the burning of children was, Leviticus xx. 2. (Grotius) --- It was done in imitation of the latter, and became more common, as it was less cruel; the person who was thus expiated, being to pass between or to jump over fire. The council of Trullo (canon 65,) was forced to condemn this remnant of an abominable superstition. But the other inhuman worship of Moloc, and of other pagan divinities, was certainly very common, and chiefly brought down destruction upon the people of Chanaan. See Jeremias xix. 5., Ezechiel xxiii. 37., Psalm cv. 37., and 4 Kings xvii. 31. Ennius says, <i>Pæni sunt soliti suos sacrificare puellos.</i> See St. Augustine, City of God vii. 17.; St. Jerome in Jeremias vii. 31. (Calmet) --- <i>Soothsayers.</i> The original term may also signify, "that useth divination." Both those who set up for diviners, and those who consult them, are condemned. (Haydock) --- Hiscuni explains it of a superstitious practice, by which a person measured a stick with his finger, saying first <i>I will go;</i> and then <i>I will not;</i> and if, when he came to the end of the stick, he had to say <i>I will go,</i> he determined to begin his journey. See Ezechial xxi. 21. --- <i>Dreams.</i> Hebrew <i>mehonen,</i> (Leviticus xix. 26,) may denote one who judges from the sight of the clouds, or feigns revelations. --- <i>Wizard.</i> Hebrew, "witch." Septuagint, "poisoner," or one who gives things to do harm. (Rabbins)'

It might be derived from the Hebrew <i>patah,</i> "to seduce," because a serpent seduced Eve, and dealers with the devil generally deceive those who consult them. Septuagint, "a belly talker," as these impostors muttered some sounds, intimating that a spirit gave answers from their belly, See Isaias xxix. 4. --- <i>Tellers.</i> Hebrew, "wise men." (Haydock) --- Those who promise great knowledge from the secrets of the caballa, or magic. --- <i>Dead.</i> Necromancy was already very common. Thus the witch of Endor made the ghost of Samuel appear to Saul, 1 Kings xxviii. 7. The Rabbins say that the person took a bone, or the skull of the dead, when he intended to enquire into futurity. (Drusius)'
      v:013:

Any mixture of superstition in the worship of God is hateful to him; and that man who acknowledges any other spirit capable of foretelling what will come to pass, freely (Haydock) denies the Lord.

(Haydock) --- They shall be filled with my spirit. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - "DEU:18:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Prophet.</i> This passage plainly proves, that the Scripture may have many literal senses: for the context insinuates that God would supply the wants of his people, so that they should not need to go far in order to consult diviners, since they should have leaders and prophets, after the death of Moses, who might explain to them God's will, as they had desired; but at the same time, it clearly refers to the Messias, as it is explained by St. Peter, (Acts iii. 22.; Worthington) and by St. Stephen, Acts vii. 37. The Jews, at that time, were convinced of the truth of this application: but they only denied that Christ was the Messias. They have since gone a step farther, and deny that it regards the Messias, some referring it to Josue, others to Jeremias, &c. (Ap. Munster and Fag.) But surely what other prophet could be compared with Moses? (Chap. xxxiv. 10.) What other man reunited in his person the qualifications of lawgiver, chief of God's people, mediator, &c., or who was <i>like</i> him? Hence <i>prophet</i> is written in the singular, to denote his eminent dignity. (St. Augustine, contra Faustus) --- St. Philip recognized the claim of Jesus, as did the people after the multiplication of bread, John i. 45., and vi. 14. God the Father seems to allude to this passage, according to the remark of Tertullian, (contra Mar. iv. 22,) when he says <i>hear ye him,</i> (Luke ix. 35,) as St. Cyprian believes our Saviour does also, John v. 46. St. Athanasius (contra Arianos 2) condemns the error of the Jews, who would apply this passage to any other prophet but to the Messias. If they could be excused for denying him this latter claim, they surely cannot in calling in question that Jesus was a true <i>prophet,</i> since he has all the marks of one; (Grotius) and if they would once acknowledge this, they must soon confess that he is also the Messias, and the Son of God, as these truths are so necessarily connected. (Calmet) --- The miracles of Moses were far exceeded by those of Jesus Christ, and the latter conversed more intimately with his eternal Father, &c. (Menochius)"

(Haydock) --- God now chastises the faithless Jews. (Du Hamel)'

        - 'DEU:18:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Fear him.</i> Septuagint, "you shall not spare him," but cut him off by death. (Haydock) --- Though the completion of what has been foretold be not a sure sign of a true prophecy, (chap. xiii. 2,) yet when the thing does not come to pass which the prophet had spoken unconditionally, he must undoubtedly be rejected; as also when he speaks in the name of false gods. No miracles can then establish his credit. The prophecy of Jonas, and many of the other prophecies, were conditional. (Calmet)'

        - 'DEU:19:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Cities.</i> These were Hebron, Sichem, and Cades, on the west side of the Jordan, Josue xx. 7. Those on the east were already appointed, chap. iv. 41. Three others might also have been added, (ver. 8.; Calmet) in case the Hebrews had gotten full possession of the countries as far as the Euphrates. (Haydock) --- The cities of refuge were not above forty-five miles distant from each other, in the land of Chanaan. Those in Galaad were not so far off, as the territory was smaller. (Calmet)'

      v:006:
        - 'DEU:19:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Grief.</i> The law granted so much to the sudden passion of a relation, who met the man slayer out of the cities of refuge, as not to punish him if he gave way to the dictates of vengeance, how unjust soever. (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - 'DEU:19:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>At equal,</i> &c. This addition is not in Hebrew (Calmet) or the Septuagint, (Haydock) but is conformable to the regulation given, ver. 3. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - 'DEU:19:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>And when.</i> Septuagint, "but if." This condition was never fulfilled <i>at all times;</i> (ver. 9,) and therefore the Israelites could blame only themselves, if the promises which God had made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, (Genesis xv., xxvi., xxviii., and xxxv.,) were not realized. (Haydock) --- Though the country was conquered under David and Solomon, the Israelites did not drive out the former inhabitants, (Calmet) nor did they keep possession for any long time. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - 'DEU:19:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>His city.</i> Strict enquiry was made into the circumstances attending the manslaughter, Numbers xxxv. 12. If the refugee was proved guilty, he was delivered up to the next relation of the deceased to be put to death. (Haydock)'
      v:013:
        - 'DEU:19:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Innocent.</i> Many Latin copies have "guilty blood," <i>noxium.</i> By putting the offender to death, Israel was expiated from the blood which had been shed unjustly. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'DEU:19:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Landmarks,</i> either which divided the tribes, or the inheritance of individuals. The former were strictly kept up till after the captivity. Those who removed the latter were to be scourged for theft, and again for disobeying this law. (Selden, Jur. vi. 3.) Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. 8,) understands that encroachments on the territories of others, which give rise to many wars, are hereby prohibited. (Calmet) --- So are likewise innovations in religion. The Romans had a superstitious veneration for these landmarks, which they adored under the name of the god Terminus, (Haydock) crowning them with flowers, and offering cakes and sacrifices to them. <i>Spargitur et cœso communis Terminus agno.</i> (Ovid, Fast.) --- They punished the crime of removing them either with death, banishment, or a fine.'
      v:015:
        - 'DEU:19:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>One</i> would suffice to make an enquiry into the affair, and to oblige the person accused, in pecuniary matters, to take an oath that he owed nothing. (Maimonides) --- <i>Stand.</i> This expression was become proverbial, to denote the certainty of a thing, Matthew xviii. 16., and 2 Corinthians xiii. 1. Two witnesses cannot so easily carry on a cheat, (Calmet) as was seen in the case of Susanna. [Daniel xiii.] (Haydock) --- The law is satisfied with moral certainty. (Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - 'DEU:19:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Transgression</i> against the law, by apostacy or by idolatry, (Junius) or by any other grievous crime. The person accused might, in this case, be examined, but he could not be condemned unless another witness appeared. Demosthenes (contra Aristocrat.) informs us how (Calmet) the Athenians (Haydock) required the witness in criminal matters, to swear on the flesh of a wild boar, ram, and bull, that he spoke the truth, and to utter horrible imprecations against himself and family, if he did otherwise. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'DEU:19:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Lord,</i> in the tabernacle. (Menochius) --- <i>Judges.</i> Hence it appears evidently that the priests were to pass sentence in all difficult questions, as well in those which regarded individuals, as in those which attacked the worship of God; since the false accuser is to lose his life or limb, according as he had attempted to injure his neighbour; (ver. 21,) and the Lord ratifies their sentence. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - "DEU:19:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Things.</i> This is the design of penal laws, to render justice to the innocent, and to prevent the spreading of a contagious evil, by cutting off the hopes of impunity. (Grotius, Jur. ii. 10. 9.) --- \"I would cause the criminal's throat to be cut, says Seneca, (de Ira ii.) with the same countenance and mind as I kill serpents and venomous animals.\""
      v:021:
        - 'DEU:19:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Pity.</i> This regarded the judge, who must act with impartiality. (Worthington) --- The law admits of no mitigation, but inflicts the same punishment on the calumniating witness, as he intended should fall upon his brother. (Lyranus; &c.) --- Some Rabbins (apud Fag.) pretend that this was executed with rigour, only when the innocent had sustained some real injury. See Exodus xxi. 24. (Calmet)'

      v:002: 'DEU:19:2 | 2 | 2 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Thou shalt separate to thee three cities in the midst of the land, which the Lord will give thee in possession,'
      v:003: 'DEU:19:3 | 3 | 3 | Paving diligently the way: and thou shalt divide the whole province of thy land equally into three parts: that he who is forced to flee for manslaughter, may have near at hand whither to escape.'
      v:004: 'DEU:19:4 | 4 | 4 | This shall be the law of the slayer that fleeth, whose life is to be saved: He that killeth his neighbour ignorantly, and who is proved to have had no hatred against him yesterday and the day before:'
      v:005: 'DEU:19:5 | 5 | 5 | But to have gone with him to the wood to hew wood, and in cutting down the tree the axe slipped out of his hand, and the iron slipping from the handle, struck his friend and killed him: he shall flee to one of the cities aforesaid, and live:'
      v:006: 'DEU:19:6 | 6 | 6 | Lest perhaps the next kinsman of him whose blood was shed, pushed on by his grief, should pursue and apprehend him, if the way be too long, and take away the life of him who is not guilty of death, because he is proved to have had no hatred before against him that was slain.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'DEU:20:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Egypt.</i> Hence it appears that the doctrine of the Quakers, who condemn all wars, is contrary to that of <em>God</em>. If they were always essentially unlawful, He would never have authorized them. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - 'DEU:20:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Priest.</i> Eleazar, the high priest, acted in this capacity in the war against Madian, and sounded the trumpet, as it was not beneath his dignity. Many priests always attended the army, (Calmet) the <i>captain</i> of whom (Haydock) first made the declarations (ver. 5, 6, 7,) to the whole army; and these were repeated by the inferior priests at the head of each company, when the army was set in array. So were also the promises of protection, (ver. 3, 4,) when all were ready for battle. The Rabbins assert, that the option was granted only in those wars which were undertaken without the express command of God, and that officers were placed in the rear with hatchets or scythes, to cut the legs of those who attempted to flee. (Grotius; &c.) --- But this seems to be an invention of their own, and Moses makes no distinction between voluntary wars and those of precept. These regulations were, no doubt, observed, though the sacred historians do not mention the particulars. (Calmet) See 1 Machabees iii. 56.'
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:20:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Back.</i> Hebrew, "do not quake," (Haydock) or fall into disorder, hurry, &c.'
      v:004:
        - 'DEU:20:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>God.</i> All must be done in his name, by the direction of his ministers. The Jews pretend that the ark was carried, in the midst of the army. But this does not seem to have been generally the case. (Calmet) --- <i>Of you.</i> "We must co-operate, being assisted" by God, as St. Augustine (q. 30,) observes, in our spiritual conflicts. (Du Hamel)'
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:20:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Captains.</i> Hebrew, "<i>shoterim,</i> (Septuagint <i>grammateis,</i>) shall proclaim to the people." Whether these were the chief officers, or only heralds, does not appear. (Calmet) --- They were probably the priests attached to the army, ver. 2. See chap. i. 15. (Haydock) --- <i>Dedicate it.</i> Hebrew, "begin to use it," on which occasion a feast was made. (Jansenius) --- Psalm xxix seems to have been intended for such a solemnity. At the dedication of the walls of Jerusalem, great rejoicings were made, 2 Esdras xii. 27. Josephus and the Rabbins allow a whole year for the occupation of the house, before the builder or new owner, could be obliged to go to war, in like manner as that term is specified for a person who had lately married a wife, chap. xxiv.5. The ancient Greeks deemed it a great misfortune to leave a house unfinished and a new wife desolate, which was the case of Protesilaus. (Homer, Iliad i.)'
      v:006:
        - 'DEU:20:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Common.</i> Hebrew, "hath not profaned it." (Menochius) --- During the three first years, the fruit was not eaten. In the fourth it was sacred to the Lord, and given to the priests, so that the owner could not partake of the fruit till the fifth year, when it ceased to be in a manner sacred. Jonathan translates, "and has not redeemed it," by paying the first-fruits of the fifth year. Septuagint, "has not rejoiced in it," by feasting, as was probably the custom at the first vintage. Other fruit-trees entitled the owner to the like privilege. (Schikard., Jus. reg. 5.) --- <i>Whereof all may eat,</i> is added by the Vulgate to explain what is meant by <i>common.</i> (Calmet)'
      v:007:
        - "DEU:20:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Taken her.</i> It was customary to leave the espoused virgin in her father's house for the space of a year, (during which time, if she proved unfaithful, she was punished like an adulteress, chap. xxii. 23, &c.) and she could not be given till she was 12 years old. If she were 13 complete, when she was asked in marriage, she was only obliged to wait 30 days. (Selden, Uxor. ii. 1.) (Chap. xxv. 5.) Philo allows this immunity from war, only to those who had espoused a virgin. They were also freed from paying taxes, mending roads, &c., chap. xxix. 5. (Calmet) --- Those who are entangled with worldly cares, are apt to discourage the valiant, and to dissuade fighting, for fear of losing these advantages: much more are those in danger who have to fight for a heavenly kingdom, if they be too much attached to the things of the earth. (Worthington; Haydock) --- \"That man who is enslaved to his wife, cannot serve in the warfare of the Lord.\" (St. Jerome, contra Jov. i.)"
      v:008:
        - 'DEU:20:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Fear.</i> Such often occasion the loss of battles. Alexander sent away all who had not courage to follow him in his expeditions. (Curt. x.) The Rabbins condemn these faint-hearted soldiers to carry water, &c., for the army, to prepare the roads and places for encampments. (Calmet) --- But this seems contrary to the intention of the lawgiver, who sends them back to their <i>houses.</i>'
      v:009:
        - 'DEU:20:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Man.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people, they shall appoint captains of the armies to lead forth the people." (Haydock) --- It seems rather late to have this to do, when the battle was ready to commence, unless perhaps the whole was arranged in a general assembly, when no one was at the head of the people, (Calmet) as was sometimes the case in the days of the judges. (Haydock) --- Hebrew of the Massorets implies, "The princes of the army shall make a review (or take down the numbers) at the head of the people."'
      v:010:
        - 'DEU:20:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Peace.</i> Interpreters are not agreed whether this law was general, and included the nations whom God had ordered the Hebrews to exterminate, or not. They were nothing but the executioners of his decree. They were commanded not to marry any of their daughters, but to put all to fire and sword, Exodus xxxiv. 15, 16. The cities which were not assigned to them for a possession, were to be treated in a different manner; (ver. 15,) and hence the Gabaonites, being convinced that they were comprised in the number of the devoted cities, pretended that they came from a great distance. Josue (ix. 4, 7,) and the heads of the people, acknowledge that they could not make a league with those nations whose lands they were to possess. Yet the Gemarra of Jerusalem asserts, that Josue proposed to the Chanaanites, "flight, peace, or war." The Gergesites hereupon fled into Africa, the Gabaonites accepted peace, and 31 kings declared for war. (Selden, Jur. vi. 13.) --- Maimonides and Grotius (Jur. ii. 13,) maintain, that no war can be lawful, unless an offer of peace be made. The latter undertakes to prove, that the commands respecting the Chanaanites were conditional, and presupposed that they would not yield to the terms which were offered. Hence Rahab was saved, the league with the Gabaonites was kept, even after it was known who they really were. Solomon, who conquered some of the surviving Chanaanites, did not think himself bound to destroy them, 3 Kings ix. 2., and 2 Paralipomenon viii. 7. The reason why they seem to be consigned to death without pity, is because God foresaw their evil disposition, as Josue (xi. 20,) insinuates, and the Israelites under his eye gave quarter to some Chanaanites. "War, says St. Augustine, (ep. 189. ad Bonif.) is waged only that peace may be obtained." But these arguments do not seem so convincing, as to take away the opposition which God has established between these devoted nations and others, ver. 15. What he commands cannot be unjust, and the army only executes his sentence. (St. Augustine in Jos. q. 10.) Grotius allows that he foresaw the obstinacy of the Chanaanites, so that it would have been useless to offer them any terms; and in effect, we find no vestiges of any being offered in the books of Moses or of Josue. (Calmet) --- Yet see chap. xxi. 10. (Haydock) --- The Israelites might have many reasons for going to war either with their brethren, or with foreign nations, as to punish a heinous crime, a rebellion, &c. (see Judges xx., 2 Kings x. 4, and xx. 15,) on which occasions they were bound to offer terms. (Calmet) --- "A wise man ought to try every expedient before he takes up arms." (Terence.)'
      v:011:
        - 'DEU:20:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Tribute.</i> This was usually imposed by the victor, to defray the expenses of the war, and to prevent its breaking out again. The kings of Moab had to pay 100,000 rams, and as many sheep, to the kings of Juda, 4 Kings iii. 4. Hiram gave 120 talents of gold to Solomon, by way of tribute, 3 Kings ix. 15. Josue and Solomon condemned some of the Chanaanites to manual labour, 2 Paralipomenon viii. 8.'
      v:012:
        - 'DEU:20:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Besiege it.</i> The Rabbins assert, that when the city of Madian was attacked in the days of Moses, one side was left unmolested, that the inhabitants might escape, and that this practice was afterwards observed as a law. But we see nothing of the kind in Scripture.'
      v:014:
        - 'DEU:20:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Excepting women,</i> &c. These were supposed incapable of making any resistance, or of carrying arms. Slaves also were excused, on account of their want of liberty to choose for themselves, and old men, unless the war was undertaken by their advice. "I am not accustomed to wage war with captives, nor with women," said Alexander. (Curt. 5.)'
      v:016:
        - 'DEU:20:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Live.</i> Hebrew, "thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth." Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. 8.) acknowledges that all were to be slain; though some of the Rabbins have supposed that they might be spared, if they would abandon idols, &c.'
      v:017:
        - 'DEU:20:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Jebusite.</i> Samaritan and Septuagint add, "the Gergesite." (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - "DEU:20:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Not a man.</i> Hebrew, \"the tree of the field, man.\" Which the Protestants supply, \"<i>is</i> man's <i>life</i> to employ <i>them</i> in the siege.\" Septuagint, \"is the tree....a man?\" (Haydock) --- We might render the Hebrew, \"as for the tree of the field, it shall come to thy assistance in the siege,\" ver. 20. (Haydock) --- They are \"like men,\" and may be of great service in making warlike engines. They are here contrasted with fruit-trees, which must not be cut down, unless they be in the way, or of service to the enemy. All other things of the same nature, as houses, corn, water, &c., must be spared, as well as those who do not bear arms. Yet God ordered the houses to be demolished in the war with the Moabites, 4 Kings iii. 19. (Calmet) --- Pythagoras enjoins his disciples not to spoil a fruit tree.

      v:020: 'DEU:20:20 | 20 | 20 | But if there be any trees that are not fruitful, but wild, and fit for other uses, cut them down, and make engines, until thou take the city, which fighteth against thee.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'DEU:21:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Land.</i> The Jewish doctors hence infer, that if the corpse was found hanging or drowned &c., or nearer a town of the Gentiles than one of the Israelites, this law did not oblige. They are so exact as to dispute whether the distance must be measured from the nose or from the naval of the deceased. (Selden, Syned. iii. 7.) But the law shews us, that the author of the murder must be discovered, if possible, as the crime is so grievous as, in a manner, to defile the land, and draw down the vengeance of God, if it be carelessly left unpunished. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - 'DEU:21:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Ancients and judges.</i> After the strictest enquiry, if the murderer could not be discovered, the magistrates and senate of the neighbouring cities measured which city the corpse was nearest. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] iv. 8.) The Rabbins pretend that five of the Sanhedrim were commissioned to make this enquiry, along with the magistrates of the neighbourhood. Others think that the <i>ancients</i> were only the old men. The measuring took place only when the point was contested, and those cities are probably meant, which were of sufficient importance to have twenty-three judges fixed in them. (Calmet) --- It was presumed that the nearest had been guilty of greater negligence. (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:21:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Heifer,</i> not above three years old, say the Rabbins. The pagans esteemed those victims more agreeable to the gods, which had not been yoked. Chermon observes, that the Egyptians rejected such as had been once "consecrated to labour." (Grotius) --- This circumstance might here indicate, that the murderer was a son of Belial, or "without yoke;" (chap xiii. 13.; Menochius) and the heifer was slain to shew what he deserved, and must expect if he be discovered. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - "DEU:21:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Valley.</i> In such places murders are most frequently perpetrated. Hebrew may signify, \"a desert,\" deep or inaccessible torrent, (Haydock) on the side of which the heifer was to be slain, and its body was then, it seems, thrown into the water. The ancients first washed their hands over her. Thus the victim of malediction against those who break a covenant, is buried in a ditch, or cast into the sea. (Homer, Iliad i.) --- <i>Was.</i> Some translate the Hebrew \"shall be,\" as if the place was to be hereafter considered as unclean and accursed. (Calmet) --- The roughness and depth of the valley, denote the hardness of the murderer's heart, and the depth of his malice. (Menochius) --- <i>Strike off,</i> or <i>cœdent,</i> \"cut the neck,\" (Haydock) at the top, without perhaps separating it entirely from the body. Blood was given for blood, and this was the chief design of the bloody sacrifices. For this reason, the Egyptians impressed a seal on the horns of the victim, representing a man kneeling, with his hands tied behind his back, as if ready to receive the stroke of death. (Plut.[Plutarch,?] Isis.)"
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:21:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Judged.</i> We see here again the great authority of the priests, chap. xvii. 9. Hebrew, "by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried," as the Protestants render it. (Haydock) --- Some understand by stroke, the leprosy, of which they were undoubtedly the judges. But it is better to explain it of all wounds, and even of death, (Calmet) concerning which Moses is here speaking. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins restrain the authority of <i>priests</i> as much as they can, to give greater power to their chimerical Sanhedrim. They pretend that here they had only to pronounce the blessing, ver. 8. Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. 8,) joins the magistrates with them in the whole ceremony. This awful meeting of so many people, tended to discover the authors of the murder, as all would naturally converse together on the subject, and each person declaring what he knew, some suspicions might at last be formed, which might by degrees lead to the detection. Josephus says rewards were proposed to any who might make a discovery. Draco decreed, that on the very day when a murder was announced, if the author was not known, the whole people (of Athens) should be purified. (Calmet) --- Abulensis insinuates, that if the murderer was present in the crowd, he might be detected by blood gushing from the corpse of the deceased, &c., as God often brings murder to light in a wonderful manner. (Cic.[Cicero,?] Div. i.) (Tirinus)'
      v:006:
        - 'DEU:21:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Wash.</i> This was intended to testify that they were not guilty of the blood which had been shed, and that they wished to remove the punishment of it from themselves upon the head of the heifer, (Calmet) the representative of the unknown murderer. So Pilate conformed to this custom, when he condemned Christ on the bare accusation of the Jews; (Matthew xxvii. 24) and the priest, at mass, washes his hands, as an emblem of that innocence, with which he ought to approach to the holy of holies. (Haydock) --- Asterius was stricken with lightning, for touching the altar of Jupiter without having washed his hands. (Natal. Myth. i. 10. 14.) The pagans generally purified themselves with fumigations, or by sprinkling sea water upon their bodies. Achilles ordered the things which had been used to purify the Greeks, at the siege of Troy, to be thrown into the sea, as being unclean. (Iliad i.)'
      v:007:
        - 'DEU:21:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>It.</i> Magistrates are in some degree responsible, if by their neglect the high roads are unsafe. (Calmet) --- They had testified that they had done their duty. (Worthington)'
      v:009:
        - 'DEU:21:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>And,</i> &c. Hebrew, "Thou shalt put away," (Haydock) or "extinguish <i>the voice of</i> innocent blood," which otherwise would cry to heaven for vengeance, Genesis iv. 10. In this sacrifice, (Calmet) though it deserves not the name, (Menochius) we may consider Jesus Christ suffering for the sins of others. (Calmet)'
      v:010:
        - 'DEU:21:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Captives.</i> Some Rabbins say this was only lawful in what they call voluntary wars, which the Lord had not commanded, as in those which were waged against the devoted nations, it was not permitted to reserve the women, even though they should embrace the true religion. Calmet seems to be of the same opinion in the preceding chapter, to which he even refers. But here he thinks, that upon their complying with the condition specified, they might be married, as Rahab was, and consequently this law must be considered as an exception to those general laws, which prohibit matrimony with those nations of Chanaan, which were otherwise ordered to be entirely destroyed, chap. vi. 16. "We believe, says he, that if these women changed their religion, they might be espoused, of whatever nation they might be." He seems still to exclude the Chanaanite women, (chap. xxiii. 3,) which variation of sentiment shews that the point is not to be easily decided. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'DEU:21:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Lovest her.</i> The Jewish doctors explain this of an action, which modesty disallows, and which they tolerate nevertheless in the first transports of victory; (Selden, Jur. v. 13,) though the pagans condemned it as unjust and contrary to reason. (Grotius, Jur. iii. 4) <b>—</b> All know with what reserve Alexander treated the captive women; and the Romans banished one Torquatus, for having violated a prisoner of war. (Plutarch) <b>—</b> Yet the Jews blush not to assert, that such liberties might be taken even with married women, as their former marriage with a pagan was by some deemed null, and by others thought to be dissolved. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] iv. 8) (Calmet) <b>—</b> The law, however, seems only to allow the marrying of those who had <i>no husbands</i> before, as the women are only said to <i>mourn for father and mother,</i> ver. 13. (Haydock) <b>—</b> On these occasions the Chinese, and probably the Egyptians also, and the Roman matrons, formerly clothed themselves in white, while almost all other nations assumed black. (Tirinus)'
      v:012:
        - 'DEU:21:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Hair.</i> In mourning, people did the reverse to what they were accustomed to do in the days of joy. The men let their hair grow, the women cut this ornament of their head, a thing which the prophets often threaten, Isaias xv. 23., and Jeremias xlvii. 5, &c. (Calmet) --- <i>Nails.</i> Some would translate the Hebrew "she shall make her nails <i>grow,</i>" as a mark of sorrow, perhaps usual among the pagans <i>faciet ungues.</i> But the Septuagint, Philo, &c. agree with the Vulgate; (Menochius) and the Hebrew may very well have the same sense. We must not judge of the idea which others have of beauty, by our own sentiments. Some women in America have long nails, and esteem them as marks of beauty and nobility; and in China, they let those of the left hand grow, and cut them in mourning. (Hist. Sin. iii. 1.) The people of Mauritania take a pride in having long nails. (Strabo, xvii.) The Duke of Burgundy, not 300 years ago, was distinguished among the slain, before Nancy, in France, (Haydock) by the length of his nails; (Calmet) and, in ancient times, people never cut them in voyages at sea, unless to express their grief in extreme danger. <i>Huic fluctus vivo radicitus abstulit ungues.</i> (Propert. iii.; Petron.[Petronius?]) Why, therefore, might not these captives follow the same custom, as all depends on fashion? (Calmet) --- The woman being deprived of her ornaments, the passion of the soldier might probably abate. St. Jerome (ep. 84,) applies this to worldly learning, which he endeavoured to make subservient to the truth, after he had cut away what was dead and pernicious in it. (Du Hamel)'
      v:013:
        - 'DEU:21:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Raiment.</i> In mourning, people wore different clothes from what they did at other times, 2 Kings xiv. 2. --- <i>One month.</i> So long the mourning for Aaron and Moses continued, chap. xxxiv., and Numbers xx. (Menochius)'
      v:014:
        - 'DEU:21:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Her.</i> Nothing shews the weakness of the Hebrews more than this liberty, which the law was in a manner forced to allow, to prevent greater evils. The soldier who has married a captive, may abandon her, if he set her free, (Calmet) which was but a slight punishment for his inconstancy.'
      v:015:
        - 'DEU:21:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Two wives.</i> Moses never expressly (Haydock) sanctions polygamy; but he tolerates it frequently, as excused by custom, the example of the Patriarchs, &c.; a toleration which Christ has revoked, as contrary to the primary design of God, and the institution of matrimony. (Calmet) (Matthew xix.)'
      v:016:
        - "DEU:21:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Hated,</i> or less loved. (Haydock) --- The inheritance goes to the first-born independently of the father's disposition, in order to prevent the disturbances which would otherwise have taken place in families, where the different wives would have been continually endeavouring to get their respective children preferred before the rest. David indeed assigned the throne to Solomon, to the exclusion of Adonias; but this was done by the command of God, 3 Kings i. 17. The regulation of Jacob, in favour of Joseph, was made prior to this law. The Jewish doctors inform us, that a father cannot disinherit any of his lawful heirs, except the judges ratify his sentence, while he is in health. But if he be dangerously ill, his verbal declaration will suffice, provided he appoint some one whom the law does not reject. For if he were to make a Gentile his heir, the will would be null. The testament must be made in the day time, for which they cite Ecclesiasticus xxxiii. 24. They say likewise that a father may, while living, give his effects to whom he pleases, and by this means disinherit his children; or he may give the succession to one of them, who is then considered as a tutor of the rest, and is bound to maintain them with necessaries till the year of jubilee, when each may claim his respective share. (Selden, Succes. c. xxiv.) But all these regulations seem to contradict the law. (Calmet)"
      v:017:
        - 'DEU:21:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Double portion.</i> If a person left six children, his effects were divided into seven equal parts, and the eldest son received two of them, though others think that he was entitled to one-half of the whole, (Calmet) in order to enable him to support the dignity of the family, (Haydock) and the greater expenses which he had to incur for sacrifices and solemn feasts. (Grotius) --- If he were dead, his children or heirs were entitled to his portion. This was the prerogative of the first-born, 1 Paralipomenon v. 2. (Selden) --- The right to the priesthood, if they might have claimed it before the law, was now given to the family of Aaron. Females had no privilege above one another. They received equal shares, when there was no male issue, Numbers xxxvi. (Haydock) --- <i>First.</i> Hebrew, "the beginning of his strength." See Genesis xlix. 3.'
      v:018:
        - 'DEU:21:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Son.</i> The Rabbins do not look upon children as bound by the law, till they be 13 years old. Their faults, before that age, are imputed to the father, and he is to be punished for them. When, therefore, a son has attained the competent years, the father makes attestation of it in the presence of ten Jews, declaring that he has instructed his son in the commandments, customs of the nation, and daily prayers; and that he now sets him at liberty to answer, in future, for his own faults, praying that God would enable him to lead a virtuous life. (Calmet)'
      v:019:
        - 'DEU:21:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Ancients.</i> In considerable cities there was a tribunal of three, and another of 23 judges. The former took cognizance of the first accusation, and condemned the stubborn child to be scourged: but the latter sentenced him to be stoned in case of a relapse, provided both parents concurred in prosecuting their son, as they would not both surely be guided by passion. (Theodoret, q. 20.) The Rabbins, according to their custom, modify this law, and exempt girls, orphans, and boys under 13 years of age. (Selden, Syned.) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] xvi. 17,) says that the parents laid their hands on the head of the undutiful, and then all the people stoned him. Moses has not specified the punishment of parricides, (Calmet) as he deemed it next to impossible. (Haydock) --- But we may hence judge how he would have chastised so heinous a crime. The Romans formerly sewed such wretches in a leathern sack, (Cic.[Cicero,?] Invent. ii.) but afterwards they enclosed with them a dog, a cock, a viper, and a monkey; and having first whipped them so as to fetch blood, placed them in a chariot drawn by black oxen, and hurled them into the sea or into some river. (Justinian) --- Solomon sentences those who contemn their parents to be the food of crows and eagles, Proverbs xxx. 17. No restraints were laid by the ancient Greeks on the authority of a father, as he was esteemed the most equitable judge. (Sopater, ap. Grotius) (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - "DEU:21:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Gibbet.</i> Whether the person was first killed, as the Jews assert, or he was left to die upon the gibbet, see Calmet's Diss. It is also a matter of doubt, whether he was nailed to the gibbet, or hung on it by a rope. (Bonfrere)"
      v:023:
        - "DEU:21:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Of God.</i> Chaldean, \"he has been fixed on the gibbet for sinning against God.\" Symmachus and Arabic, \"he has blasphemed the Lord.\" Syriac, \"the man who has blasphemed shall be hung.\" Only people accused of great crimes, such as blasphemy and idolatry, were condemned to this reproachful death, and prayers were not said for them in the synagogue, as they were for other persons, during the 11 months following their decease. (Calmet) --- They are not to be remembered before God. Their dead bodies are to be buried before sunset, that the country may not be <i>defiled.</i> The punishment itself is extremely infamous, and the name <i>of God</i> is often used by the Jews, to express something in the highest degree, as the <i>cedars of God,</i> &c. (Haydock) --- Some understand this passage, as if the body were not to be left on the gibbet, because man, being created to the likeness of God, he will not allow the body to be insulted. Homer (Iliad xxiv.) says that Achilles offered an insult to the earth, when he dragged the dead body of Hector round the walls of Troy. Others think, that the criminal having been treated with due severity, as <i>accursed of God,</i> his corpse must not be deprived of decent burial. <i>Res sacra miser.</i> The Jews refused this privilege to none but suicides, (Josephus, Jewish Wars iii. 25,) while the Egyptians and Phœnicians suffered the bodies to rot upon the gibbet, whose inhumanity God here reproves. St. Paul reads this verse in a different manner both from the Hebrew and Septuagint, leaving out <i>of God,</i> and substituting, with the Septuagint, the words <i>every one,</i> and <i>on a tree. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,</i> Galatians iii. 13. St. Jerome remarks, that on this as well as on other occasions, he adheres to the sense, without following the express words of Scripture. He also observes, with Tertullian, that only those are declared accursed by the law, who are hung for their crimes; and as Jesus Christ suffered, not for any fault of his own, but being willing to appear in the character of one accursed, he has procured for us all blessings. (Calmet) --- In a mystical sense, that man is accursed who is obstinate in sin, hanging as it were on the tree, which was the occasion of our first parents' transgression. (Worthington) --- St. Jerome seems to think that the Jews have inserted <i>of God,</i> to intimate that Christ was accursed of him. (Haydock)"

(Du Hamel)'
      v:003:
        - "DEU:22:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>If,</i> &c. Hebrew, \"thou must not hide thyself,\" so as to pass it by, nor yet conceal it from the right owner. When a thing is certainly abandoned by him, it belongs to the person who seizes it first; but if it be only lost, it must surely be restored, if possible, (Grotius, Jur. ii. 10,) as nature forbids us to take advantage of another's misfortune. (Cicero) --- The Rabbins have corrupted this law, like so many others, by their evil interpretations. They pretend that a Jew must restore what he has found belonging to another true believer, if it have certain marks by which it may be known, but not if it belonged to a prevaricator or infidel. In the former supposition, they got the thing cried on a high stone near Jerusalem four times, and if the owner did not then claim his property, the finder might keep it. (Selden, Jur. vi. 4.) --- The inhabitants of Cumæ condemned the next neighbour to restore what had been lost; as Hesiod (op. 348,) very well remarks, that things would not easily be lost, if the neighbours were not ill-disposed."

All know what noise was occasioned by the action of Clodius, who put on women's apparel, that he might be present with the Roman ladies at the feast of the good goddess. Yet others think that Moses here forbids some superstitious practice. St. Ambrose (ep. 69,) remarks, that in some of the mysteries of the idols, it was requisite for those present to change clothes in this manner, <i>sacrum putatur.</i> Lucian testifies, that men put on women's clothes at the feasts of Bacchus. They did the like in those of Venus, while the women took men's clothes in the festivals of Mars. (Jul. Hirmic. c. 4.) (Maimonides) --- In the East, people honoured the moon, to which they attributed both sexes, and Venus in like manner. Josephus ([Antiquities,?] iv. 8,) believes that women are here prohibited to engage in warfare. Hebrew, \"the vessels (armour) of man shall not be upon a woman.\" Semiramis gained a great name by her martial exploits, and commanded all her subjects to dress like herself. (Justin., i) --- The Amazons were likewise very famous in war, and it is said that half the army of Bacchus was composed of women. Alb. Gentil maintains that Moses here condemns an abominable crime, which he did not wish to mention, at which the Book of Wisdom hints, (chap. xiv. 26,) and which St. Paul condemns more explicitly, Romans i. 26. Moses had already denounced death against the perpetrators of it; and surely the manner in which he now speaks, seems to forbid something more than simply putting on the garments of the other sex, <i>for he,</i> &c. (Calmet) --- Yet that disorderly conduct deserved to be reprobated in strong terms, (Haydock) when it was not excused by some necessity or proper motive, such as actuated some holy virgins, St. Theodora, &c.

Such superstition is reprehensible. Phocilides advises not to take all the young ones, nor the hen, in consideration of one's having more birds. (Calmet)"

(Challoner) --- King Ochozias had the misfortune to fall from the top of his house, (4 Kings i. 2,) and David saw Bethsabee when he was walking on the roof of his palace, 2 Kings xi. 2. Saul slept at the top of Samuel's house, 1 Kings ix. 25. See Josue ii. 6., and Matthew x. 27. (Haydock)"

This mixture of seeds would also impoverish the land, so that it would be like a place <i>defiled,</i> and unfit for cultivation. (Jansenius in Leviticus xix. 19.) Maimonides supposes that the practice of the Zabians is here reprobated. They sowed the land with corn and dry grapes, in honour of Ceres and Bacchus, (More. Nev. p. 3. c. 37,) who presided over the harvest and vintage among the pagans. (Wm. of Paris. Leg. 13.) --- Moses might also, by this symbolical language, condemn unnatural connexions, as he perhaps does, ver. 10.'

People who have treated on agriculture observe, that it is a pernicious practice to make animals of unequal size and speed work together. (Colum. vi. 2.) --- St. Paul explains to us the mystical sense of this passage. <i>Bear not the yoke together with infidels,</i> 2 Corinthians vi. 14. (Calmet) --- Marry not with such.

For, according to many of the Rabbins, he might give her a bill of divorce, simply if he did not like her. (Selden, Uxor. iii. 1, &c.) --- They allow the proof here specified, only with respect to a Hebrew woman between twelve and twelve and a half years old, during the period of her being espoused, but not taken home by her husband. The cause was to be tried before the 23 judges. Oftentimes only witnesses, probably matrons, were examined in defence of the woman. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] iv. 8.) St. Ambrose (ep. 8. 64. ad Syagr.) highly disapproves of such unsatisfactory methods. The marks assigned by the law were commonly observed in Syria, Persia, &c. The Arab physicians speak of them. See Valesius, c. xxv. The age in which women were then married, the climate, &c., caused these indications to be more clear, and deposed for or against the fidelity of the bride. The mother had them entrusted to her care by the friends of the husband, who had kept watch at the door on the wedding night. (M.[Menochius;?] Nachman, ap. Fagium.)'

      v:019:
        - 'DEU:22:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>A hundred.</i> Josephus only mentions 50. As it was presumed that the false accusation proceeded from a desire to defraud the woman of her dowry, the law obliged the husband to allow her double (Calmet) the usual sum. Yet this punishment, together with the scourging, was very inadequate to what the woman would have had to suffer if she had been condemned. (Haydock) --- St. Augustine (q. 33,) is surprised at this decision, as in other cases calumny was subjected to the law of retaliation, or punished with death. This shews also that wives, among the Jews, were considered as little more than servants. (Calmet)'

        - 'DEU:22:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Die.</i> It was concluded that she had committed the sin after her espousal. If it had happened before, she was to receive only 25 sicles for a dowry; though, if she took an oath that violence had been offered to her, she was entitled to 50: which opinion of the Rabbins seems very equitable. Æschines (in Timarch.) relates, that a man at Athens punished the transgression of which his daughter had been guilty, while she was at home, by shutting her up with a horse, in order that she might be torn in pieces by the famished animal. (Calmet)'

        - 'DEU:23:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Eunuch.</i> By these are meant, in the spiritual sense, such as are barren in good works. (Challoner) (Theodoret, q. 25.) (Worthington) --- The Hebrew also specifies three sorts of eunuchs, though the Septuagint and Chaldean have only two. No mention is made of natural eunuchs, who are not excluded from <i>the church of the Lord.</i> (Calmet) --- This outrage of castration was first offered to nature by Semiramis. (Am. Marcellin. 14.) --- <i>Church.</i> That is, into the assembly or congregation of Israel, so as to have the privilege of an Israelite, or to be capable of any place or office among the people of God. (Challoner) --- Philo says, they were not to enter the court of the temple. See Lamentations i. 10. Others think they could not embrace the Jewish religion, Exodus xii. 48. But this privilege could not be refused. Most probably the custom of making eunuchs is forbidden, and if any were found among the Jews, they should not be admitted to any place of authority. Isaias (lvi. 5,) speaks of some faithful eunuchs, to whom God will give a place in his house; but he alludes to those of the new law, who embrace the state of celibacy, Matthew xix. 12. Eunuchs were rejected from the magistracy among the Romans; and when some were at last received, it was deemed unnatural, as their disposition is generally cruel and selfish. <i>Omnia cesserunt Eunucho Consule monstra.</i> (Claud. in Eutrop. i.) (Calmet) --- Those who had the misfortune among the Jews to be eunuchs, did not perhaps (Haydock) lose the right of citizenship. (Tirinus)'
      v:002:
        - "DEU:23:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Mamzer,</i> &c. The author of the Vulgate adds the explication of mamzer, which only occurs again, Zacharias ix. 6. It may in both places denote a stranger, or one of a different religion from the Jews, as Jephte was the son of a prostitute, (Judges xi. 1,) and yet became a judge of Israel. But strangers, as long as they professed a false religion, could not be entitled to the privileges of Jewish citizens; and even after they had relinquished their false worship, they were bound to wait ten whole generations, or a long time, before they could fill the posts of honour and command. (Calmet) --- This, however, seems to be contrary to the disposition made in favour of the Idumeans and Egyptians, who were admitted <i>in the third generation.</i> A mamzer may, therefore, be (Haydock) a bastard of a different nation from the Jews, (Menochius) which was not the case of Jephte. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins specify three sorts of mamzers: <b>1.</b> those born of parents who, by the law, are forbidden to marry, being too near akin; <b>2.</b> those who are the fruit of adultery, or some criminal commerce, which is punished with death; and <b>3.</b> those whose birth subjects the parents to be cut off or retrenched from the people. (Selden, Jur. v. 16.) --- The Septuagint, &c., exclude the children \"of a harlot,\" which is the sense of mamzer in the canon law. The Christian Church rejects such from holy orders, and the Athenians would not suffer bastards to offer sacrifice in the city, but only in the Cynosarge, dedicated to Hercules, whose birth was hardly legitimate. In a word, some understand that mamzer comprises all concerning whose birth any doubts might be entertained. (Calmet) --- It is observable, that such often imitate the wicked conduct of their parents; in which case, they are unfit for the magistracy; and though they may live a very exemplary life, the law is intended to discourage such practices in parents, which may entail dishonour and loss upon their children; that, if they be not sufficiently restrained by their own personal disgrace, they may at least by the love for their innocent offspring. (Haydock) --- <i>Tenth.</i> In the 11th <i>generation,</i> when the stain was obliterated, the descendant might become a magistrate. (Menochius) --- Some understand that they were excluded for ever, as when the judges of the Areopagus ordered a man to appear again before them in 100 years' time, they meant that his cause was entirely rejected. (Vatable; Casaub. in Athen. vi.)"
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:23:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Ever.</i> This shews that the former verse only excludes bastards for a time. But why are these nations treated with more severity than the Edomite and Egyptian? Because their enmity seemed to proceed from pure malice, and they attempted to ruin the souls of the Hebrews by lust and by idolatry, without any prospect of interest to themselves. Their parents were also of very base origin, and Abraham had rescued their father, Lot, from destruction; so that for his children to oppose with such virulence the descendants of Abraham, manifested a degree of ingratitude and perversity. (Calmet) --- They had found their attempts to hurt Israel abortive, and yet ceased not to persecute their near relations, (Haydock) by drawing them into carnal sins. Those who are obstinate in their evil ways, can never be rightly received into the Church of God. (Worthington) --- Achior and Ruth embraced the Jewish religion, but it does not appear that they were admitted to places of trust, Judith xiv. 6. (Haydock) --- These regulations were observed till the Babylonian captivity, while the genealogies might be ascertained. (Calmet) --- In cases of extraordinary merit, as in that of Achior, the Ammonite, (Judith xiv.,) a dispensation might be granted. (Tirinus)'

He was afterwards forced to make war upon the people, though, without such extraordinary provocations, war was not to be declared against them.

They gave them also very rich presents before their departure, Exodus xii. 35. Gratitude required that these things should be considered, (Haydock) and God orders his people generously to pass over the subsequent ill treatment of these two nations.'

The grand-children of converts are rather hereby entitled to the privileges of other Jewish citizens. (Calmet)'

(Calmet) --- It is not clear, however, that the law alludes to any other camp, but that in the midst of which the tabernacle was fixed; and Calmet, elsewhere, denies that the ark commonly followed the army.

Moderns translate, "a paddle upon thy weapon," But the Septuagint seem to have read <i>ezor,</i> "a girdle," (Calmet) which is more intelligible, as the Jews were accustomed to carry the necessary utensils, money, &c., not in their pockets, as we do, but in a bag, which they fixed to their girdles, or belts. All the Jews who dwelt in the <i>camp,</i> were bound to have a paddle, for the purpose here mentioned. (Haydock) --- Josephus (Jewish Wars ii. 7,) observes, that the Essenians always made use of one, with which they made a hole a foot deep, and covered it with their robes, that nothing indecent might be exposed to view. (Haydock) --- The Turks still follow the same custom, when they are encamped. (Busbec, ep. iii.) (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'DEU:23:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>No uncleanness.</i> This caution against suffering any filth in the camp, was to teach them to fly the filth of sin, which driveth God away from the soul. (Challoner) Those who have had the misfortune to fall into the sink of iniquity, must not fail to use the sharp instrument of compunction, with which they may hide the enormity of their crimes. (Haydock) --- <i>Incessanter terram mentis nostræ pœnitentiæ dolore confodiat &....abscondat.</i> (St. Gregory, Mor. iii. 13.) --- In a camp where three million people were collected, if some such regulation had not been made, great and serious inconveniences would have ensued. The lawgiver, therefore, descends to several particulars which to us might appear minute; but besides the obvious meaning, which is very rational, the words convey other mystical instructions of the highest importance. <i>God</i> was pleased to assume the character of a powerful monarch, residing among his people, and hence every appearance of indecency must be removed. (Haydock)'
      v:015:
        - 'DEU:23:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>To thee,</i> from among the Gentiles. The promised land was thus declared a land of liberty, (Calmet) to encourage poor slaves to embrace the service of the true God, and to flee from the slavery of the devil, and from the society of those who adored him in their idols. The whole earth belongs to the Lord, and He was thus pleased to punish those who might claim a right to these slaves. (Haydock) --- Some believe that the price was given to the owner, at the public expense. The Rabbins allow this privilege of an asylum, only to those who fled from a foreign country, or from an infidel master, to embrace the true religion. Circumcision was given to them as an inviolable mark of liberty. (Chaldean) Those who had been sold for their crimes, or for debt, by the sentence of the judge, could not claim this exemption. (Grotius, Jur. iii. 7.) --- Philo (de humanit.) says, it would be unjust to give up a slave who has sought refuge with us. We ought either to reconcile him to his master, or sell him to another, and give the price to the former owner. Some translate the Hebrew in a contrary sense, "Thou shalt not shut up the slave who has fled to thee from his master," as if it were unjust to refuse to deliver him up. But the law points out some cases where it is lawful for a slave to flee away, and consequently people must be allowed to receive him. The following verse is decisive in favour of this explanation.'
      v:017:
        - "DEU:23:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Israel.</i> Some hence very erroneously infer, that before this prohibition the thing was not criminal. (Selden, Jur. v. 4.) Notwithstanding the law, such lewd practices continued to be very common. The original expresses that both the women and the men were consecrated, \"<i>kadash,</i>\" in all probability to some idol, whom they intended to honour by abominable prostitutions, a thing very common in all the East, as we learn both from profane and sacred authors. (Aten. xiii. 5.) (4 Kings xxiii. 7.) The men were called <i>the effeminate,</i> 3 Kings xiv. 24. (Calmet) --- Some copies of the Septuagint have a double translation of this verse, and add, \"None of the daughters of Israel shall bear the mysteries, nor shall any of the sons of Israel be initiated (in these mysteries of idols) to make every vow.\" <i>Telesphoros</i> denotes <i>a strumpet for hire,</i> ver. 18; or, according to Vossius, one who is initiated or performs the pagan mysteries, as fornication and idolatry, commonly go together in the sacred writers. Hesychius seems to understand, that it refers to \"the house where a person has been delivered of a child.\" But Tertullian (pudic. ix.) explains it thus, \"No one....shall pay tribute;\" as <i>telos</i> means tribute, (Haydock) and the Jews are supposed to have refused to pay any to the Romans on the authority of this verse. See Casaub. in Baruch ii. 19. (Grotius) (Calmet) --- But it seems far more probable, that it is a farther elucidation of the text, and prohibits that scandalous impiety by which may were not ashamed publicly, like dogs, to commit the most obscene actions, and to present the hire of their bodies to the idols, Micheas i. 7. (Clement of Alexandria, Exhort.; Villalpand in Ezechiel xliii.) We could hardly give credit to those who have attested such things, did not God here find it necessary to caution his people not to fall into such blindness and delusion. That the poor ignorant idolater should think by these means to appease those gods who, while here on earth, had been infamous for the like excesses, needs not so much to excite our surprise. But that the Gnostics, Manichees, and other heretics, almost of all ages since the light of the gospel shone forth, should have thought that they could honour the true God by abusing the flesh, is truly astonishing. Yet they gave into this delusion, by first persuading themselves that the flesh was the creature of an evil principle, fighting against the author of the spirit and of all good, with whom they intended to take part. <i>The way of a fool is right in his own eyes.</i> Yea, <i>there is a way that seemeth to a man right, and the ends thereof lead to death,</i> Proverbs xii. 15., and xvi. 25. These wretches grounded their opinion on the authority of their gods, or of the Scripture. Will this excuse be admitted by the Sovereign Judge? But these delusions are perhaps now at an end. --- A principle, however, is still maintained of a far more pernicious tendency, inasmuch as it strikes at the root of every law, divine and human. This horrible doctrine was inculcated by J. Wesley for above thirty years, as we have already observed, chap. xvi. 22. \"O natural man,\" says he, (Serm. on Orig. Sin,) \"thou canst do [no] good. Thy natural actions are sin; thy civil actions are sin; thy religious actions are sin. As many thoughts, words, and actions, so many sins; for nothing but sin comes from thee. Thy duties are sins. Can an evil tree bring forth good fruit?\" Thus Scripture teaches him that to work for one's family, to pay taxes, to pray, read the Scriptures, or even to believe, will be a sin! \"Knowest thou not that thou canst do nothing but sin, till thou art reconciled to God?\" (Sermon on the Righteousness of Faith.) Hence arose the Still-Methodists, Jour. iv. p. 92.. Even after this celebrated reformer had begun, when almost 70 years of age, to discover \"the subtle poison, which he says, (Jour. viii. p. 90,) has infected, more or less, almost all, from the highest to the lowest among us,\" it is astonishing that he still acknowledges those who were infected with it, as the \"real children of God by faith.\" Many of these, he says, (serm. on the law) lay it down as an unquestionable truth, that when we are come to Christ, we have done with the law; and that in this sense, <i>Christ is the end of the law</i> to every one that believeth. We need, therefore, no longer wonder that the pagans should think they honoured their idols by prostitution, (which on other occasions they condemned as \"a great disgrace,\" <i>oneidos mega,</i> as Musonias calls it,) since in this enlightened age, a man of no mean abilities, and far advanced in years, a man who requires that all the preachers in his connexion shall conform to his <i>Sermons and Notes on the New Testament,</i> or be superceded, (Jour. xx. p. 34,) could decide that those who maintain this principle, and make it a branch of their religion to break the law of God on purpose, are the \"real children of God by faith;\" people, \"whom God has taken out of the world.\" As well might he say that a man may live on <i>subtle poison,</i> and please God, by following a doctrine than which \"nothing can be more false,\" as he styles this very principle of Antinomianism, to which he and his preachers had \"leaned\" for such a length of time. \"If, says a great admirer of his, Mr. Fletcher, (1 Check, 4th letter,) the three first propositions of the minutes are scriptural, Mr. Wesley may well begin the remaining part, by desiring the preachers in his connexion to emerge along with him from under the noisy billows of prejudice, and to struggle quite out of the muddy streams of Antinomian delusions, which have so long gone over our heads, and carried so many souls down the channels of vice into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone.\" This is then to be the abode of those whom \"God has taken out of the world, and who are real children of God by faith!\" This is the heaven, of which they may boast in dying that they are infallibly sure of! At least, the man whom they have so eagerly followed as their judge, has passed this woful sentence upon them, as if he had a mind to laugh at their credulity. If he join us also in the same condemnation, and say, \"I have the same assurance that Jesus is the Christ, and that no Romanist can expect to be saved, according to the terms of his covenant;\" (Jour. iii. p. 94.) we are not solicitous about his good opinion; we have not chosen him for our judge, nor have his writings given us reason to think that he knew the nature of our covenant. If he did, so much the more dreadful must have been his reckoning with that unerring Judge, before whom he has appeared 20 years ago. It is the glory and happiness of the Catholic Church, that no one attempts to assail her, but he presently betrays the spirit by which he is inspired, the spirit of calumny, and of the perverse application of Scripture. It was thus that our divine head was treated by the father of lies, who alleged Scripture to encourage suicide, or presumption, Matthew iv. 6. So in the various points of faith which Mr. Wesley attacks, he shamefully misrepresents our doctrine, that he may have something to oppose. We have seen how unjustly he accuses us of idolatry, chap. xvi. 22. But in order, perhaps, to comfort us with the reflection, that we have many partners in guilt, he represents the Protestants as equally criminal. \"They set up their idols in their churches; you set up yours in your heart....O how little is the difference before God! How small pre-eminence has the money worshipper at London over the image worshipper at Rome; or the idolizer of a living sinner over him that prays to a dead saint.\" (Word to a Protestant.) How much soever the Protestants may be entangled in this species of idolatry, they do not at least pretend to authorize it by the principles of religion, as some of the Methodists have done. Witness the man with whom J. Wesley conversed at Birmingham. \"Do you believe that you have nothing to do with the law of God? He answered, I have not, I am not under the law....Have you also a right to all the women in the world? Yes, if they consent. And is not this a sin? Yes, to him who thinks it is a sin; but not to those whose hearts are free. The same thing that wretch, Roger Ball, affirmed in Dublin. Surely these are the first-born children of Satan.\" (Journal vi. p. 133.) Witness Mr. Fletcher, a celebrated clergyman in the Methodist connexion, who has informed us that Antinomian principles and practices had spread like wild fire among the Methodists. \"Nor need I go far, says he, for a proof of this sad assertion. In one of his (Wesley's) societies, not many miles from my parish, a married man, who professed being in a state of justification and sanctification, growing wise above what is written, despised his brethren as legalists, and his preachers as persons not clear in the gospel. He instilled his principles into a serious young woman; and what was the consequence? Why, they talked about finished salvation in Christ, and the absurdity of perfection in the flesh, till a perfect child was conceived and born; and, to save appearances, the mother swore it to a travelling man that cannot be heard of. Thus, to avoid legality, they plunged into hypocrisy, fornication, adultery, perjury, and the depth of ranterism, &c.\" (Check i. Let. 2.) But enough of such absurdity. We may now easily believe to what length the dissolute examples and maxims of the heathenish mythology, would lead their unhappy votaries, when we behold the purest lessons of the gospel so strangely perverted. (Haydock) --- <i>Whoremonger.</i> It is very probable, that the Scripture here means such as were guilty of unnatural impurities, \"consecrated,\" as it were, to some idol of lust, as these crimes were common under several faithless kings of Israel and of Juda, 3 Kings xv. 12., and xxii. 47. Simple prostitutes are styled zona. (Calmet) --- God will not allow these to be publicly tolerated, though they contrived but too often in private to ensnare the hearts of God's people, 3 Kings iii. 16. (Tirinus) --- Onkelos translates, \"No Israelite shall give his daughter in marriage to a slave, nor take one for his son's wife,\" as the contract would be null, according to the Rabbins, for want of liberty. (Calmet) --- He may, perhaps, have given this singular turn to this verse, because the preceding one speaks of fugitive slaves."
      v:018:
        - "DEU:23:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Dog.</i> Many explain this in a figurative sense, as we have done in the last verse, to denote the public impudence by which some thought to honour their gods. (Haydock) --- Such impiety the Lord abhors, though practiced by all the surrounding nations, as ancient records unanimously attest. How incredible soever it might otherwise appear, that a false notion of religion, joined to a natural depravity, could prompt people to such excesses, we cannot call in question the veracity of so many historians. See Herodotus i, and ii.; Just.[Justinian?], xviii. 6.; Eusebius, præp. iv. 6.; St. Augustine, City of God iv. 10; and the sacred writers, Baruch vi. 42., and Proverbs xix. 13. The Rabbins explain dog literally, and observe that a prostitute, or one who has had any commerce with a man with whom it was not lawful for her to marry, could not offer what she had thus gained to the Lord, nor what had been received in exchange for a dog. Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. 8,) understands it of such hunting or shepherds' dogs as had been lent for hire to propagate the breed. Maimonides thinks that what the strumpet had received in kind, could not be presented, but with the price of it she might buy suitable victims. But Josephus and Philo admit of no such exceptions. They reject all sorts of presents made by strumpets, in detestation of their crimes; and it was probably from the same motive that the Jews concluded it was unlawful to put <i>the price of blood</i> into the treasury of the temple, Matthew xxvii. 6. In the Christian Church, the offerings of public sinners were not received, even to be distributed among the poor. These would not even take an alms from the hands of St. Afra, while she remained a courtesan of Augsbourg. Even the pagan emperor, Severus, refused to admit into the sacred treasury the tribute arising from such unworthy means. (Lamprid.) --- Some believe that Moses forbids the price of a dog to be presented, as the Egyptians had a sovereign respect for dogs; and many nations offered them in sacrifice, particularly for expiation. All the Greeks purified themselves, by making a dog be carried round them. (Bochart, p. 1, B. ii. 56.) Isaias (lxvi. 3,) seems to insinuate that dogs were sometimes immolated. St. Augustine, (q. 38,) and others, believe that dogs are not to be redeemed, as the first-born of other things are, probably because they were too mean, and the price too insignificant to purchase another victim. But we may adhere to the explication which was first proposed. (Calmet) --- <i>Both.</i> The dog was an unclean animal, and strumpets defiled their own bodies, and draw down the indignation of that God, who is a pure Spirit, and loves chaste souls. <i>Without are dogs and sorcerers, and unchaste, and murderers, and servers of idols.</i> (Apocalypse xxii. 15.) (Haydock)"

        - 'DEU:23:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>To the stranger.</i> This was a dispensation granted by God to his people, who being the Lord of all things, can give a right and title to one upon the goods of another. Otherwise the Scripture every where condemns usury, as contrary to the law of God, and a crying sin. See Exodus xxii. 25., Leviticus xxv. 36, 37., 2 Esdras v. 7., Psalm xiv. 5., and Ezechiel xviii. 8, 13, &c. (Challoner) --- The <i>stranger</i> means the devoted nations of Chanaan, &c., whom God authorized his people to destroy. "Exact usury of him whom thou mayst kill without a crime," says St. Ambrose., (de Tob. c. 15,) though this principle will not always excuse usury. This practice was always considered as unjustifiable, except when God gave permission to his people to get by this means the possession of the property of the stranger, the right to which he had already given to them; unless we may consider, that he only tolerates this practice towards the stranger, on account of the hard-heartedness of the Jews. Christ has now expressly declared it unlawful for any one. See Exodus xxii. 25. (Calmet)'

But Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. 8,) extends it to all; and he says, that those who did not even invite travellers to partake of their grapes, and other fruit, were to be punished with 39 lashes.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'DEU:24:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Uncleanness.</i> Tertullian (contra Marc. iv.) reads, "if she be found guilty of any impurity," <i>negotium impudicum.</i> Septuagint, "unseemly action;" and many learned commentators suppose that Moses only allows a divorce in cases of adultery, or in those which render the woman dangerous to a family, as if she had the leprosy, or some other infectious disorder, or was likely to corrupt the morals of her children, or if she were barren. The Pharisees were divided among themselves in determining the sense of this law, (Calmet) and they endeavoured to inveigle our Saviour, by proposing the question to him. If it were lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause, <i>quacumque ex causa,</i> or for any reason whatsoever, Matthew xix. 3. (Haydock) --- Our Lord does not take notice of the limitation here added by Moses; (Matthew v. 31.) nor do the Pharisees, when he asks them, <i>What did Moses command you?</i> (Mark x. 3.) Whence it seems, that the liberty which was taken was very great, and that the limitation was not regarded. Our Saviour, nonetheless, alludes to it, when he admits that Moses permitted a divorce, in case of adultery. But he recalls them to the institution of marriage, and will no longer allow people to marry again, even in this case, as Moses had been forced to permit the Jews, on account of the hardness of their heart. (Calmet) --- Before this permission, the Jews were therefore, it seems, much addicted to this practice. --- <i>Bill.</i> The law does not command divorces; but in case the parties come to such a determination, it requires a bill to be given to the woman. The Jews require the greatest formality in drawing it up, and witnessing it, and they say the divorce must take place upon a fountain or river. (Schikard. Jur. iii. 9.) --- Munster gives this form of a bill: "The 4th day of the month of Sivan, of the year 5293 from the creation of the world, in this place and in this city of N, T.[I,?] N, son of N, had a mind to divorce, and has divorced N, daughter of N, who hitherto has been my wife; and I grant her leave to go whither she has a mind, and to marry whomsoever she pleases, so that no one shall hinder her. In witness whereof, I have given her this bill of divorce, according to the ordinances of Moses and of Israel." The Jews still assert their right to put away their wives. (Buxt. Syn. xxix.) (Calmet) --- But it is sinful for them, or for any other, to marry the woman divorced, till the first husband be dead. If they do, they are guilty of adultery, as our Saviour and St. Paul repeatedly inculcate. (St. Augustine, de Adult. Conj. i. 11.) (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - 'DEU:24:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Defiled.</i> This insinuates that the second marriage was a real adultery, (Calmet) and only tolerated by the law to prevent greater evils. (Haydock) --- It might be said indeed that the woman was defiled, with regard to her former husband, who could not take her back without condemning his former proceeding (Calmet); as he would seem to have only lent her for some mean consideration. (Menochius) --- Domitian took the privilege of a judge from a Roman knight, who had resumed his wife after he had divorced her for adultery. (Suetonius, viii.) But how then is the woman <i>abominable before the Lord?</i> Some say the thing itself is extremely dishonourable, as the Hebrew intimates, though the woman have done nothing but what the law allows. Grotius believes that the man might take back his wife, at any time, before she was married to another. But the Rabbins limit this privilege to three months after the date of separation. God forbids his priests to marry with those who had been divorced, as it is to be presumed that they have not been rejected by their former husbands without good reason, Leviticus xxi. 7. The man who cohabits with an adulteress, is deemed a fool; (Proverbs xviii. 22,) and some have believed, that it was necessary to put such away. But St. Paul advises a reconciliation, 1 Corinthians vii. 11. --- <i>To sin,</i> or to incur the punishment due to it. (Calmet) --- If the state connived at the transgression of the law, the judgments of God would fall upon the people.'
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:24:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Wife.</i> This indulgence was granted to those who had married a widow also. Hebrew, "a new wife," as she was new to him, (Haydock) which right he could not claim, if he only resumed the one whom he had divorced. (R. Salom.; Drusius) See chap. xx. 7.'
      v:006:
        - 'DEU:24:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Life,</i> or the means of supporting himself. (Haydock) --- The upper millstone was deemed the less necessary. In more ancient times it was customary to dry the wheat by fire, and afterwards to pound it in a mortar. Then millstones were invented, which slaves of the meanest condition had to turn. Pliny ([Natural History?] xviii. 10,) mentions, that some few water-mills were used in his time. But this useful invention had been neglected, till Belisarius restored it again in the fifth century, when he was besieged in Rome by the Goths. (Procop.) --- Jonathan, and the paraphrast of Jerusalem, explain this quite in a different sense: "Thou shalt not use any enchantment for the consummation of marriage, since it would be to destroy the lives of the children to be born."'

(Calmet) --- It seems from this and the following verse that God frequently punished disobedience to his ministers, as he did <i>Mary</i> [Miriam], (Numbers xii.,) by inflicting upon them this shameful disorder. (Haydock) --- So he punished king Ozias, 2 Paralipomenon xxvi. (Menochius) --- The design of this precept is, therefore, not so much to order people not to contract a disease, which they cannot perhaps always avoid, as to caution them against pride and rebellion. (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - "DEU:24:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Pledge.</i> This was left to the choice of the debtor, provided he gave sufficient. The Athenian and Roman laws allowed a person to search his neighbour's house, for what he had lost: but he was to enter covered only with a short garment round his middle, (Calmet) to prevent his taking away any thing which did not belong to him."
      v:012:
        - "DEU:24:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Night,</i> if it be a garment or bed covering, which may be necessary for the poor man. (Haydock) --- By allowing the creditor to keep the pledge such a short time, God wished to discourage the taking of any from such as were in real distress. (Menochius) --- The same regulation required, that if a necessary implement for labour, during the day time, was pledged, it should be returned in the morning. (Calmet) --- This was done every day, to admonish the creditor and the debtor to exercise mercy and justice in their respective situations. The debtor was to remember to do his utmost in order to pay his debts. (St. Augustine, q. 41.) --- These daily debts were not remitted in the sabbatic years, according to the Rabbins, whose opinion seems very hard and inconsistent. (Haydock) --- Solomon advises not to stand bond for another's debts, Proverbs xx. 16., and xxii. 26. Many nations in the Indies allowed no action at law to recover debts, as the creditor ought to have taken his precautions before he parted with his money or merchandize. (Stobœus.; Strabo, xv.) (Calmet)"

(Haydock) --- Day labourers are obliged to support themselves and families with their wages; (Menochius) so that if they agree to have them paid every day, it would be an injustice to detain them. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - 'DEU:24:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Sin.</i> Judges have no right to punish any but those who have transgressed. (Calmet) --- God may for reasons known to himself, which cannot be unjust, visit the sins of the fathers upon their children; (Exodus xx. 5) and hence, (Josue vii.) he ordered the family of Achan to be involved in his punishment. Temporal sufferings, or death itself, are not however always a misfortune. They frequently prove a source of inconceivable blessings, Romans v. 3. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins understand, that fathers and children are not to be received as witnesses against each other, (Onkelos) which seems foreign to the sense of the present law. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - 'DEU:24:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Pervert.</i> Thou shalt not pass an unjust sentence upon any one, particularly (Haydock) upon those who are least able to defend themselves. (Menochius)'
      v:018:
        - "DEU:24:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>This thing.</i> It is uncertain whether this refer to the preceding or to the following law. It may be applied to both, as the remembrance of the Egyptian slavery might teach God's people not to oppress, but rather to shew mercy to those in distress. As the same thing is however repeated, ver. 22, it seems more probable that the present verse forbids any oppression. (Haydock)"
      v:019:
        - 'DEU:24:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Forgot.</i> The Rabbins say, that both the owner and the labourers must forget the sheaf: but this is a vain subtlety. (Calmet) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. 8,) is more agreeable to the spirit of the law, when he (Haydock) observes that gleanings, and some of the fruit of the vine and olive trees, were to be left on purpose for the poor, Leviticus xix. 9. (Menochius)'

        - "DEU:25:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Not muzzle,</i> &c. St. Paul understands this of the spiritual labourer in the church of God, who is not to be denied his maintenance, 1 Corinthians ix. 8, 9, 10. (Challoner) --- Other labourers, and even beasts, must likewise be treated with humanity. It was formerly the custom in Egypt, Judea, Spain, &c., to have a clean spot in the field, round a tree, where during the heat of the day, they spread the sheaves, and made oxen continually go round, to tread out the corn. Some had the ill nature to muzzle them, or to cover their mouths with dung; (Æliian iv. 25,) whence arose the proverb, \"an ox in a heap\" of corn, to denote a miser, who amidst plenty will not eat. (Suidas.) --- Moses condemns this cruelty; as it is not just, says Josephus, to refuse these animals so small a recompence for the assistance which they afford us in procuring corn. (Calmet) --- Besides this literal sense, God had principally in view the mystical one, which St. Paul unfolds to us. (Menochius) --- Paine hence takes occasion to ridicule priests, who, he says, \"preach up Deuteronomy, for Deuteronomy preaches up tithes.\" But this book enjoins them no more that other books of Scripture, and common reason dictates that the labourer is worthy of his hire. If the artizan, &c., will not work for nothing, why should priests spend their lives and fortunes, for the benefit of the people, without deriving any advantage from them? Who has served in the wars at his own charge at any time? (1 Corinthians ix. 7.) Whether the mode of paying tithes be the most eligible, for the support of God's ministers, is a question of smaller importance. It may at least plead a very high antiquity, (Haydock) as it was in force 400 years before the law of Moses. Abraham paid tithes to Melchisedeck, who was both king and priest; and Pisistratus received tithes from the people of Athens, to be expended in the public sacrifices, and for the general good. (Laert. in Solone.; Watson, let. 2.)"
      v:005:
        - "DEU:25:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Together,</i> as the sons of Juda did: (Genesis xxxviii. 8,) though custom (Calmet) and analogy extend this to other brothers, at least to those who live in the promised land, and have the inheritance in common, as appears from the history of Ruth, Ruth i. 13, &c. Noemi supposes that all the sons whom she might have had, would have been under the same obligation towards her daughter-in-law. The Rabbins restrain this law as much as they can, asserting that if the deceased left an adopted or natural child, the brother need not marry his widow, nor was any obliged but the next in age, and not married. St. Justin (q. 132,) teaches the reverse. (Calmet) --- Half-brothers were included, (Menochius) and indeed every relation, in order, who, upon the refusal of the next heir, wished to take possession of the deceased person's land, Ruth iv. (Haydock) --- The Jews no longer observe this law, as they have not possession of Chanaan. (Cuneus i. 7.) --- Fagius asserts that it was neglected after the captivity of Babylon, because the inheritances were confounded. (Calmet) --- This, however, does not seem to have been the opinion of those who have undertaken to reconcile the genealogy of our Saviour, given by Sts. Matthew and Luke, by supposing that St. Joseph was the son of Jacob by birth, and of Heli according to the law. (St. Hilary) Africanus says, (Ep. to Aristides) that \"Heli dying without issue, Jacob was obliged to marry his widow, by whom he had Joseph, a descendant of Solomon by Jacob, and of Nathan by Heli,\" as their common mother, Esta, had married successively Mathan and Melchi, (or rather Mathat) who sprung from those two branches of David's family. (Dupin) (Haydock) --- The Athenians followed a similar regulation with respect to orphan young women, whom the next of kin were bound to marry and to endow. The Tartars assert their right to marry the widows of their brethren. The Egyptians did not consider the marriage as real, nor any relationship contracted, in case the woman had no issue, on which principle there was no impediment to prevent the brother from marrying the widow of his brother. On other occasions such contracts were declared illegal, Leviticus xviii. 16. (Calmet) --- This was a positive law, (Worthington; Genesis xxxviii.) which admitted of an exception."
      v:006:
        - 'DEU:25:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Name.</i> Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. 8,) takes this literally, as St. Augustine once did, though afterwards he retracted that opinion, (B. ii. 12,) on considering that Booz called his son Obed, and not Mahalon, which was the name of the first husband of Ruth, Ruth iv. 17. (Calmet) --- Houbigant thinks some omissions have taken place in the very short genealogy of David, mentioned in that chapter, and instead of Obed, he would substitute Jachin, as the first-born of Ruth. He thinks that Solomon alluded to two of his ancestors, when he styled the two pillars before the temple Jachin and Booz. "In strength it shall stand <i>or</i> establish," 3 Kings vii. 21. Hebrew, "the first-born which she beareth shall arise (or succeed) in the name (or by the right and title) of his brother." See Numbers xxiv. 3. (Haydock) --- Name is sometimes put for succession, (Calmet) or instead of another. (Menochius)'
      v:009:
        - 'DEU:25:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>In his face,</i> or presence, upon the ground, as appears from the Gemarra of Jerusalem, where we read this form: (Haydock) "In our presence, (the three judges are specified) N, widow of N, hath taken off the shoe of N, son of N. She brought him before us, and took off the shoe from his right foot, and spat in our presence, so that we saw her spittle upon the ground; and she said to him, So shall he be treated who will not establish the house of his brother." Before this ceremony took place, the widow was obliged to wait three months, to prove that she was not in a state of pregnancy; for if she were, the brother could not marry her. He was never obliged to do it, but if he refused he was deemed infamous. The taking off the shoe was intended to humble him, as well as to shew that he relinquished all his claim to the inheritance. Josephus ([Antiquities?] v. 11,) says, that Ruth gave the relation who would not marry her, a slap on the face, or rather as it ought to be printed "she spat in his face," which was a mark of the greatest ignominy, chap. xii. 14., Isaias l. 6., and Matthew xxvi. 67.

Much more do they who are appointed pastors of the Church, if they do not zealously endeavour to increase the number of God's servants, whom they must attach to him, and not to themselves. Thus the disciples of St. Paul were known by the general name of Christians. (St. Augustine, contra Faustus xxxii. 10.) (Worthington)"

(Grotius) (Calmet) --- She would thus put the man in danger of having no posterity.

When no number is specified, the dual is commonly understood. (Haydock) (Leviticus xii. 5, &c.) --- Two large stones would be sufficient to contain the words of the decalogue, and they would more strikingly represent the two tables written with the finger of God. They were probably first polished, and the letters raised upon them <i>in relievo,</i> as the Arabic marbles in the University of Oxford are done. The white plaster being then used to fill up the interstices between the letters of black marble, the words would appear <i>very plainly.</i> (Kennicott, Dis. 2.) --- Others think that a high and durable monument was raised both for an altar and for the inscription, though some would allow four others for this purpose. (Calmet) --- <i>Plaster.</i> The Hebrew does not specify <i>all over;</i> and Houbigant supposes, that the cement was only used to join the stones together.

Josue, in effect, <i>wrote upon stones the Deuteronomy of the law of Moses,</i> which Josephus explains of the curses and blessings inscribed upon the two sides of the monument, as an abridgment of the whole law. (Calmet) --- <i>The Jordan</i> is not in Hebrew expressly, but in the Septuagint. After the Israelites had crossed this river, they were thus to make a solemn profession of their adherence to the law of God, (Haydock) as they did (ver. 12,) after they had taken Hai; though Josephus insinuates, that they deferred for five years the accomplishment of what is here required. (Tirinus)'
      v:004:
        - "DEU:27:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Hebal.</i> It affords a matter of surprise to Ludolf, that this barren mountain of cursing, (ver. 13,) should be fixed upon by God, for the erection of his altar and for solemn feasting, instead of Garizim, which is most luxuriant. Reland believes that their very names designate <i>sterility</i> and <i>fruitfulness.</i> But we must observe that the Samaritan copy, both here and Exodus xx., specifies that Garizim was to be the place so highly distinguished. Almost all interpreters agree in condemning the Samaritans of a wilful corruption of their text, on this account. But Kennicott adduces several very plausible arguments in their defence, and even throws the blame upon the Jews, who are accused of having taken similar liberties with their text, by St. Jerome, (Galatians iii. 10,) in leaving out the word col, <i>all,</i> which he found in the Samaritan Pentateuch, (ver. 26,) as well as in St. Paul. It is remarkable that the Protestant \"version allows the corruption of the present Hebrew copies. For as it inserts other necessary words elsewhere, so here, says the Doctor, it inserts the word <i>all,</i> noting it with a different character, as deficient in the present Hebrew.\" Another plain instance of fraud is acknowledged by many of the Jews, (Judges xviii. 30,) where, because the grandson of their lawgiver became the first priest of Michas' idol, in the tribe of Dan, they have inserted an <i>n</i> over or in the name of Moses, to change it into Manasseh. \"The letter nun was written, says Jarchi, in order to change the name for the honour of Moses.\" (Talmud, fol. 109.) Michaelis adduces the same reason from Abendana, (Gottingen, comment. 4, 1753) thus acknowledging a wilful corruption made by the Jews, which in the former volume he had asserted had never yet been clearly proved against them. Kennicott himself had once been of the same persuasion. Josue xv. 60, eleven cities are omitted, perhaps originally by mistake, though St. Jerome thinks that they may have been left out by the ancient Jews, because Bethlehem Ephrata is there described as in the tribe of Juda, agreeably to the prophecy of Micheas v. 2. It seems, therefore, that the Jews were as capable of falsifying the text as the Samaritans. Their hatred against the latter was also excessive, insomuch that they vented all sorts of imprecations against them, and even decreed, \"that no Israelite eat of any thing that is a Samaritan's, nor that nay Samaritan be proselyted to Israel, nor have nay part in the resurrection.\" (R. Tanchum.) (Walton, proleg. 11. 4.) --- Hence we read, (John iv. 9,) <i>the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.</i> See Ecclesiasticus 1. 25.[l. 28.?] Many passages of the New Testament set the character of the latter, however, in a more favourable light than that of the Jews. They were open to conviction, on the preaching of Christ and of the apostles. See St. Chrysostom on John iv., and the history of the Samaritan cured of the leprosy, whose behaviour, contrasted with the ingratitude of the nine Jews, obtained the glorious approbation of the Son of God, who disdained not to describe himself, on another occasion, under the character of the good Samaritan, Luke x., and xvii. The Samaritans are also acknowledged by the Jews themselves, to be more zealous for the law of Moses, and more rigid observers of the letter of it, than the people of their own nation. (Obadias; Hottinger.) --- It is not probable, therefore, that they would designedly interpolate that very law, which alone they received as of divine authority among the writings of the prophets. Besides, what interest could they have on this occasion to substitute Garizim? As they had possession of both the mountains in question, if they had known that Hebal had been honoured with the altar, &c., what hindered them from building their temple upon it? What could be the reason why Joatham chose Mount Garizim as the place from which he might address the men of Sichem, to bring them to a sense of their duty? unless because he was convinced not only that Abraham had sacrificed there when he first came into Chanaan, (Genesis xii. 6,) but also that God had chosen it for the place where his covenant with Israel should be ratified, as soon as the Israelites had taken possession of the country. But it may be said all the ancient versions agree with the Hebrew. No doubt those which have been taken from that text agree with it. But the Samaritans have a version in their own dialect, and another in Arabic, both which were in the possession of Walton, who believes that the former \"was made not long after the days of Esdras, while the Samaritans and the Jews followed the same religion.\" This, as well as the Arabic, which is extant in this place, both in its own and in the Samaritan character, all admit the word Garizim; and the Greek version, which some believe was made from the same text soon after the reign of Alexander the Great, (Hottinger) if it really ever existed, must no doubt have retained the same reading. These versions claim a higher antiquity than that of the Septuagint. But in reality the versions can prove nothing on either side, in the present case, as the interpolation is supposed to have taken place before they were made, and soon after the building of the famous temple of Sanaballat, which Prideaux places about the year 409, B.C. This temple chiefly enkindled the mortal hatred of the Jews against the Samaritans; and as it was built upon Mount Garizim, they were afraid lest they might from this text conciliate greater authority to that place, and assert that it was the house of the sanctuary, as they afterwards did, having priests of the stock of Aaron, who there offered holocausts, when Benjamin visited them above 400 years ago. Their claim however was unjustifiable, and their priesthood schismatical. Though Moses commanded that an altar should be erected on one of these mountains, he did not determine that the ark was to remain there for ever, nor does he seem to have decided where it was to be fixed. God afterwards chose Mount Sion for his habitation, and revealed his will by his prophets. These the Samaritans ought to have obeyed, as well as the pastors, whom the Almighty had commissioned to determine all difficult matters, chap. xvii. The text before us decides nothing in their favour. The substitution of Hebal makes nothing against them, much less does it establish the pretensions of the Jews, who, if they had intended to authorize the building of the temple at Jerusalem, ought rather, it should seem, to have written Moria or Sion. As they have not done this, perhaps it may be as well to admit that this variation may have originally happened, by the inadvertency or malice of some transcriber of great authority, whose copy being followed by others for some time, without any criminal design, might at last supersede the proper word, particularly when the erroneous reading was become common, and was found to annoy an enemy. Authors of great eminence are forced, at least, to account for many variations of equal importance in this manner. It seems difficult to lay the blame of such mistakes upon a whole nation, which can never be prevailed upon to join in the collusion so heartily, but that some man of more conscience than the rest will expose the imposture. When this variation took place, we may well suppose that the copies of the law were not very numerous. After a succession of wicked princes had reigned in Judea, they drew down the vengeance of God upon the whole nation, and almost all were led away captives to Babylon, where they remained seventy years. In this state of confusion, while impiety overflowed the land, how few would have an opportunity or a will to take an exact copy of the law! Some have thought that it was almost entirely forgotten in the days of Joas. Others have asserted that Esdras had to write afresh, as it were by inspiration, all that had been given by the more ancient sacred penmen. These opinions are not indeed to be admitted, but they shew that many have supposed that the copies of the law were once exceedingly scarce. Perhaps they were never more so than when the Jews were just returning from captivity, the time when the schismatical temple of Garizim was erected, and when, we have before observed, this variation is supposed to have taken place. Josephus, though a bitter enemy of the Samaritans, speaks with hesitation respecting the precise situation of the altar prescribed by Moses. The ancient Fathers seem to have taken no notice of this controversy, perhaps because it was not yet agitated with so much heat as it has been since. Our Saviour condemns neither party. If however the Samaritan copy be in this respect interpolated, as we know the reason of it, the authority of the whole Pentateuch must not on that account be rejected, as Houbigant well observes. The Jews objected to the Samaritans, that they had inserted the word Sichem: (chap. xi. 30,) \"I have said to you, O Samaritans, ye have falsified your law: for ye say the plain of More which is Sichem. <strong>[</strong>they add <i>Sichem</i> of their own accord.<strong>]</strong> We ourselves indeed confess that the plain of Moreh is Sichem.\" (Eliezer.) --- Lightfoot, who mentions these words, (V. ii. p. 505,) expresses great surprise at this Jew's accusing the Samaritans of so slight a matter, and at his not at all mentioning that far greater subornation as to Mount Garizim. What seems still more wonderful is, that no such accusation is brought against them in that famous dispute which Josephus ([Antiquities?] xiii. 3,) informs us took place before king Ptolemy, in which the parties bound themselves by oath to produce their proofs according to <i>the law;</i> and yet the historian mentions not one text from it, nor does he insinuate that the Samaritans were arraigned on account of any wilful corruption, which might then have been so easily proved. The king condemned them unheard, if we believe Josephus, though the Samaritans give quite a different account, and say that Ptolemy decreed the victory to them. (Act. Erud. Lips. 1691.) See Josue viii. 30. (Kennicott) (Haydock)"

These were stationed with the ark, between the two mountains; and when they pronounced, for example, "Blessed is he that maketh not a graven or molten thing," &c., those on Garizim answered <i>Amen;</i> and when they turned towards those on Hebal, and said, <i>Cursed,</i> &c., they replied in like manner. In the mean time, the body of the Levites might be with the other five tribes on Mount Garizim, though the priests, and those of greater dignity, might remain beside the ark, to perform this sacred function; as we read in Josue that they were stationed between the two divisions of the army. (Bonfrere) --- Some think that Levi is placed with the rest only according to the order of his birth, and that Joseph stands for two tribes. (Vatable) --- Josephus asserts, that the whole army was divided into two parts, as well as the tribe of Levi, part of which stood on each of the mountains. Then the tribes on Garizim prayed that God would bless the observers of his law; and those on Hebal answered, Amen; and after they had repeated the same blessings, those on Garizim made a similar acclamation. In like manner, they repeated the curses one after another. (Calmet) --- But this would make both the mountains equal in dignity. He places the altar likewise, with the inscription of blessings and curses on each side of it, in the midst of the valley, or rather nearer to Garizim; as he says it was not far from <i>Sichem,</i> which was built at the foot of that mountain, on the north side, while Hebal lay still farther to the north of the city, and being scorched with the sun-beams, was rendered fruitless and unpleasant. (Haydock) --- If Josephus afterwards (Antiquities v. 1,) say that the altar was on <i>Hebal,</i> we must either acknowledge that his work has been there interpolated, or that he contradicts himself. Kennicott also takes notice of a strange mistake in the grand edition of St. Ephrem, in the Latin translation, by Benedict; which, in opposition to the Syriac, has (ver. 13,) "these shall rise to curse on Mount Garizim," though Hebal is universally allowed to be the mount of cursing.'

        - 'DEU:27:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Pronounce.</i> Hebrew, "answer," as the older Protestant editions, 1540, &c., had it; though "our last translators, 1613, says Kennicott, in this, as in several other instances, altered for the worse," <i>shall speak.</i> A select company of Levites in the valley, repeated what had been declared from Hebal.'
      v:015:
        - 'DEU:27:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Thing.</i> Protestants, <i>any</i>....image. They insert the word <i>any,</i> and translate <i>image,</i> as they almost constantly do where idols are meant, to make the ignorant believe, that all images are to be rejected with the utmost abhorrence, as <i>cursed</i> things. Why then do they not observe the injunction themselves? (Chap. xvi. 22.) (Haydock) --- <i>Secret.</i> The magistrates had to punish all acts of public idolatry with the utmost severity. But God will not suffer those to escape who do such things even in the most private manner. --- <i>Amen,</i> truly; (Calmet) so be it.'
      v:016:
        - 'DEU:27:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Honoureth not.</i> Hebrew, "curseth." Septuagint, "despiseth." See Leviticus xx. 9. --- "Exodus xxi. 17., Moses proclaimed, <i>He that curseth his father or</i> (Hebrew <i>and</i>) <i>mother, shall die the death.</i>" But here he goes still farther, and denounces a curse on those who make light of (Hebrew <i>makle, vilipendit</i>) their parents; or, as Denis the Carthusian expresses it not amiss, on him "who does not honour, by shewing them obedience in due time, or by not relieving their wants as far as possible; and chiefly, if instead of honouring, he curses and uses opprobrious language towards them." "I have made this remark, says Amama, (p. 376,) in order to admonish the Germans and the Dutch that this passage has been translated by Luther with too great carelessness, <i>curseth,</i> as if the same Hebrew word, <i>kalal,</i> were here used as in the text of Exodus. But those who are not too brazen, will confess that the Hebrew text, and the more accurate versions, require greater reverence to be shewn to parents. <i>Etiam illi judicabunt qui nondum ære lavantur</i>." This author, in his animadversions upon the Vulgate, often takes occasion to mention the blunders "of B. Luther," as well as of the Septuagint and other interpreters; for he seems to be satisfied with no version which has hitherto been published. (Haydock)'
      v:017:
        - 'DEU:27:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Landmarks,</i> contrary to the prohibition, chap. xix. 14. The Rabbins say that Cain first adopted such distinctions. The ancient Greeks placed little pillars at the end of their fields, with the name of the owner engraven upon them. (Pollux, iii. 9.) --- All Thrace was divided in this manner. (Xenophon, Anab.)'
      v:018:
        - 'DEU:27:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Blind;</i> or, according to the Rabbins and Grotius, those who are on a journey, and do not know the road. "Cursed, said Diphilis, is the man who does not tell the right road." Those who lead the simple astray, are no less blameable, Leviticus xix. 14. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - "DEU:27:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Mother.</i> Some copies of the Septuagint have \"daughter-in-law;\" and some Latin manuscripts add, \"Cursed is he who sleepeth with his neighbour's wife; and all the people shall say, Amen.\" (Calmet)"
      v:024:
        - 'DEU:27:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Secretly,</i> as is commonly the case; though such as committed murder in public, were equally if not more guilty. (Haydock) --- Assassins, traitors, and those guilty of calumny, &c., are to be abhorred.'
      v:026:
        - 'DEU:27:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>In the.</i> The Samaritan, Septuagint, and St. Paul (Galatians iii. 10,) read, <i>in all the words,</i> &c., which must probably be understood of the principal points of the law, specified in the preceding verses. (Calmet) See ver. 4. --- The Jews could derive no advantage from the omission of the word <i>all,</i> as the general proposition would be equivalent. (Capellus.) --- Some are of opinion, that the blessings which Moses ordered to be proclaimed, were the reverse of these curses, ver. 12. But, is that man truly blessed who observes one point of the law, while he perhaps is transgressing the rest? At this rate, the same man might be blessed and cursed at the same time. (Kennicott) --- They are more probably, therefore, expressed in the following chapter, where the observance of all the commandments is previously required. The curses are denounced indefinitely, to imply that those who transgress the law, must stand before an unerring Judge, to receive an adequate punishment in eternity for their crying sins against the law, which was given on Mount Horeb, chap. xxix. 1. Against such criminals the preceding curses are levelled. But those recorded in the ensuing chapter, are of a temporary nature, and to be publicly inflicted without delay upon those who refuse to adhere to the service of the Lord. "God had made such a covenant with the Israelites, says Houbigant, that he would so long uphold their republic as they should worship the true God." (Haydock) --- The foregoing curses may thus refer to the ten commandments; ver. 15, denounces vengeance against all who transgress the first table of the law, which relates to God; ver. 16, sanctions the honour due to parents; ver. 18, 24, and 25, condemn those who injure or kill; as ver. 20, 21, 22, and 23, do those who are guilty of impurity; ver. 17, curseth those who steal; and ver. 19, those who bear false witness; ver. 26, is intended as a general sanction of the law, as the two last commandments secure the observance of it most effectually, by forbidding even the thought or desire of doing evil. See Kennicott, Dis. ii. p. 86. (Haydock)'

        - 'DEU:28:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>All these blessings,</i> &c. In the Old Testament, God promised <i>temporal</i> blessings to the keepers of his law, heaven not being opened as yet; and that gross and sensual people being more moved with present and sensible things.

(Calmet) --- In those dreary regions, where clouds of sand and dust overwhelm the poor traveller, the Israelites would have a good idea what inconveniences would attend such a state of the atmosphere, if it were only for a short continuance. But when it was intended for destruction, how could they possibly support life!'
      v:025:
        - 'DEU:28:25 | 25 | 25 | <i>Scattered,</i> as they are at present. The real import of the Hebrew is doubtful. Some agree with the Vulgate and Septuagint; (Haydock) others translate, Thou shalt be trembling, an object of astonishment and horror. Others, All who see thee shall quake; they shall insult over thee, wagging their head. (Calmet)'
      v:026:
        - 'DEU:28:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Away.</i> No threat could be more terrible to the Jews. They did not refuse burial to those who had been hung on the gibbet, chap. xxi. 23. Even the high priest, if he should find a corpse in the field, was obliged to bury it; though he was not allowed, on other occasions, to attend the funeral of his relations. God threatens the impious king (Calmet) Joachim, that <i>he shall be buried with the burial of an ass,</i> Jeremias xxii. 19.

        - 'DEU:28:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Ways.</i> Is not this visibly the present condition of the Jews, amid the blaze of the gospel light, the miracles and divine conduct of the Son of God! They shut their eyes, and will not acknowledge him for the Messias. (Calmet)'
      v:030:
        - 'DEU:28:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Her.</i> Job makes use of the same imprecation, Job xxxi. 10. <i>Let my wife be the harlot of another.</i> But he immediately subjoins, <i>For this is a heinous crime,</i> &c., which may be applied, both to him who seeks to commit an impure action, (ver. 9,) and to those who attempt to punish it by a similar abomination. No person is allowed to wish that a sin may be committed. The Hebrew and Septuagint very properly render all these imprecations in the future tense. "Thou shalt marry (or betroth) a wife, and another man shall," which, no doubt, would be an intolerable provocation. (Haydock)'

      v:042:
        - 'DEU:28:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>Blast.</i> This is a different word from that mentioned, ver. 22. <i>Tselatsal</i> may here probably denote a grasshopper, which delights in the shade, and has a shrill note. In hot countries it does great hurt to trees, &c. (Calmet)'
      v:043:
        - 'DEU:28:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>Lower.</i> Hebrew repeats this word, to signify the utmost abjection. (Haydock) --- The Fathers gather hence the glorious superiority to which the Christian Church is raised. (Origen, Rom. ii.) (Theodoret, q. 34.)'
      v:046:
        - 'DEU:28:46 | 46 | 46 | <i>For ever.</i> The nations which were employed by God to scourge the Jews, recognized that they were the instruments of his indignation. We are accustomed to consider many evils as the necessary appendages of human nature; but the surprising misfortunes, with which God visited his people, subjecting them to the Babylonians, Greeks, and Romans, could not be taken in this light.

The Chaldean, Septuagint, &c., agree with the Vulgate, which conveys an idea of the most horrible distress. (Calmet) --- Indeed it is so horrible and disgusting, that we find no vestiges in history of the completion of the prophecy, taken in this sense. Some, therefore, explain the original: \"And her feast, <i>or</i> dressed meat, (shall be) between her feet, even of her own children, which she shall bring forth.\" (Bate, p. 71.; Parkhurst on <i>itsoth.</i>) Others believe that the Hebrew is corrupted by the insertion of <i>b</i> before another <i>b,</i> in <i>children;</i> and by the transposition or addition of <i>i</i> in the first word; so that to translate, with the generality of interpreters, \"She shall grudge ever bit, <i>or</i> her eye shall be evil towards her husband, and towards her son, and towards her daughter, and towards her afterbirth....and towards her sons which she shall have brought forth,\" seems absurd enough. For if the woman's eye be evil towards her son, and towards her afterbirth, (which, however, is incapable of depriving her of food) what need of repeating, and towards her sons? Yet the present construction requires this translation; though it is obvious that the woman must have been actuated in a different manner, with respect to these different things, as all allow that she was afraid lest those who were grown up, how dear soever to her, might deprive her of her abominable food, while her eye was evil towards her afterbirth, (or secundines, if the word <i>ssolithe</i> can have this meaning) because she was designing to eat it privately. The Septuagint translate <i>Korion,</i> \"the skin,\" or <i>Chorion,</i> \"a little girl,\" (Houbigant) unless (Haydock) the former word may rather have this signification. Hill. --- The Arabic deviates a little from the Hebrew, \"She will deny her husband, her son, and her daughter, her secundines, which fall from her.\" If, therefore, the two corrections proposed by Houbigant, and approved by Kennicott, (who produces for one of them (<i>ubnie</i>) the authority of the oldest Hebrew manuscript in England) be admitted, all will be clear and conformable to the event. \"<strong>56</strong>. Her eye shall be evil towards....her son, and towards her daughter. <strong>57</strong>. And she shall boil, (<i>ubossilthe,</i> instead of <i>ubossolithe</i>) that which cometh out from between her feet, even her children, (<i>ubnie,</i> not <i>ubobnie</i>) which she shall bear; for she shall eat them, for want of all things, secretly.\" This prophetical and terrible denunciation was realized in the siege of Samaria, when two women agreed to eat their own children, one of whom was actually boiled, and the very word here in dispute is used, 4 Kings vi. 29. (Kennicott) --- And in the last siege of Jerusalem, we read (Josephus, [Antiquities?] vii. 8,) of a mother killing her own child, to satisfy the cravings of hunger and rage against the rioters who had repeatedly plundered her house. Her name was Mary. She also boiled her suckling infant, and actually devoured a part of it. (Haydock)"

Josephus (Antiquities xii. 2, &c., and Jewish Wars vii. 16,) informs us, that many of the Jews had been conveyed into that country after Jerusalem had been ruined by the Chaldeans; (Calmet) and after it was at last destroyed by the Romans, some of \"those who were above 17 years of age, were sent thither in chains to work at the public works;\" others were reserved to grace the victor's triumph, or \"to be destroyed by the sword, or by wild beasts in the theatres, while those who were under 17, were sold. During the time that Fronto was making the selection, 12,000 were starved to death, either by the cruelty of their keepers, or because they refused food; the multitudes causing it to be very scarce. In the course of the war 97,000 were taken prisoners, and in the siege 1,100,000 perished. For then the whole nation was shut up in prison, as it were by fate, and the city was besieged when full of inhabitants,\" at the feast of the Passover; \"so that the number of those whom the Romans slew publicly, or took prisoners, was greater than ever was destroyed,\" at once, \"by the fury of man, or by the wrath of God.\" (Ibid.[Josephus, Jewish Wars?] chap. xvii.)

(Haydock) --- <i>Buy you.</i> Protestants, \"there ye shall be sold....and no man shall buy you.\" Can a man be sold without being bought? Whereas if the verb <i>hithmaccartem</i> was rendered, <i>and ye shall offer yourselves for sale,</i> the sense would be proper, and expressive of the most bitter sufferings.\" (Kennicott) --- Hegesippus (v. 47,) says, \"there were many to be sold, but few purchasers; because the Romans disdained receiving the Jews as slaves, nor were there any Jews left to redeem their countrymen.\""

The latter observes that, <i>beside that covenant,</i> &c., shews, that the curses there recorded, are not by way of explication of those mentioned in the preceding 27th chapter, "but of a quite different kind. The former are denounced against those who violate the law of the decalogue, which was given at Horeb; neither do they threaten that the chastisements shall be inflicted in this life: the latter maledictions threaten present punishments, and those of a public nature."

Others read with an interrogation, which entirely removes the evil interpretation of the wicked, who pretend that God requires impossibilities. \"Hath not the Lord?\" &c.

(Challoner) --- St. Jerome seems to have translated <i>sephoth</i> by <i>assumat,</i> as the manuscripts and interpreters read, before the correction of Sixtus V, who adopted the other signification of the Hebrew <i>absumat.</i> (Calmet) --- The sense however seems to be the same, as <i>evil communications corrupt good manners,</i> the wicked draw on those who before were dry, or <i>thirsty,</i> and superior to the allurements of pleasure, but not quite so sincere and constant as to shut out from their hearts the desire of tasting, what the man of the world so highly extols, and thus the just give way to the temptation, and become the companion of the libertine and of the idolater, and of course share in his destruction. The feasts of the idols were generally celebrated with the most dissolute mirth, which seemed more congenial to the depraved heart of man, than the sober feasts, which the Lord allowed his people. The drunken revellings in honour of Bacchus, who was worshipped in Arabia, &c., were a disgrace to human nature. Yet it is well known with what eagerness the deluded pagans joined in these <i>religious sports.</i> How prone to such excesses the Israelites also were, sacred history too plainly shews, so that they might well be described as <i>thirsty,</i> and willing to imitate those who were already <i>drunk</i> with dissolute pleasures; and this proverbial warning was not unnecessary to remind them what they had to expect from such conduct, at least if the people should become generally addicted to the service of idols. The most terrible chastisements mentioned below, (ver. 20, &c., and in the preceding chapters, and still <i>greater,</i> chap. xxviii. 61,) hung over their guilty heads. But the man who should give occasion to such a defection from the Lord, and, like Jeroboam, cause <i>Israel to sin,</i> must remember that he will have to suffer for the sins of all those whom he has perverted. Hence this cutting remark almost always accompanies the mention of Jeroboam's name, <i>He made Israel to sin.</i> Such a one walked in <i>the way,</i> or imitated <i>the sins</i> of the <i>house of Jeroboam,</i> &c. A similar infamy and destruction attend arch-heretics and impostors. (Haydock) --- Chaldean translates, \"Let him not say.....lest he should add sins of ignorance to sins of pride.\" (Calmet) --- Septuagint, \"lest the innocent be involved in the destruction of the sinner.\" Cornelius a Lapide would leave out the negation, and translate, \"that the innocent may be,\" &c. (Menochius) --- Bonfrere believes that <i>the earth</i> is to be understood; \"and the earth <i>drunken</i> or deluged with rain, may take away its former dryness, yet so as to be rendered unfit for cultivation.\" The proverb affects those who wish for things which will prove destructive to them: so the man who expects to derive great pleasure and advantage from the practice of idolatry, will be miserably deceived, and will only bring on his own ruin; or, if his passions be gratified for a moment, he must, if he die in that state, endure eternal torments in destruction from the face of the Lord. Homer (Odyssey) says, \"Crimes prosper not; the low outstrips the quick.\" <i>Festina lentè.</i> Hasten slowly, is an old and useful admonition. <i>Ebria,</i> a drunken woman, is a very indifferent partner for one that is sober at a dance. (Haydock) --- The flesh being indulged, presently perverts the understanding. (Du Hamel)"
      v:020:
        - 'DEU:29:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Enkindled,</i> (<i>fumet</i>.) Literally, "smoke." (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "the anger (literally, nose)....smoke." The Greeks and Romans adopt similar expressions, to denote the wrath and eagerness with which a person is actuated. "Fierce anger always sits upon his nose." (Theocrit.) So Persius says, <i>Disce, sed ira cadat naso, rugosaque sanna.</i>'
      v:023:
        - 'DEU:29:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Of salt.</i> This salt was of a bituminous or sulphureous nature, which would burn like oil, and was sometimes used in lamps. (Herodotus, ii. 62; Pliny, [Natural History?] ii. 104.) It dried up the moisture of the earth, and rendered it barren. For which reason, it was scattered upon such places as were no longer to be cultivated, or inhabited. Abimelech sowed some on the ruins of Sichem, Judges ix. 45. It seems that Palestine now feels the effects of this curse; as, for the most part, it is uncultivated, and a desert, though once so flourishing. (Calmet)'
      v:026:
        - 'DEU:29:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Knew not,</i> as their gods. (Menochius) --- Indeed the gods of the heathens, were for the most part more recent than the days of Abraham, or of Moses, and only <i>newly come up;</i> (chap. xxxii. 17,) which was a sufficient proof that they were not gods. (Haydock) --- <i>Assigned.</i> It seems, as if God had in a manner abandoned other nations to the dominion of idols, while he chose Israel for his peculiar people. Hence, if they followed another god, they were to be treated as rebels. Hebrew may have another sense, "and from whom they have received nothing," Chaldean and Syriac. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "gods to whom they were not faithful, (<i>or</i> whom they did not believe) and whom I did not appoint for them." Even while the people pretended to follow the worship of idols, they could surely place no confidence in them, knowing that they were either mere creatures, or even the work of their own hands. (Haydock)'
      v:029:
        - "DEU:29:29 | 29 | 29 | <i>Secret things,</i> &c. As much as to say, secret things belong to, and are known to God alone: our business must be to observe what he has <i>revealed</i> and <i>manifested</i> to us, and to direct our lives accordingly. (Challoner) --- The nations full of surprise, at the miseries, which were inflicted upon the Jews, and upon their country, could not comprehend what might have brought on so severe a chastisement, as they little suspected that it was their worshipping those gods, which they themselves adored, ver. 2. But those who had been converted, and had been able to penetrate the secrets of God, by means of his gracious revelation, <i>answered,</i> (ver. 25, &c.,) that idolatry had been the chief cause of such inconceivable distress, and a crime of no less enormity, the refusing to acknowledge the true God, in the person of the Messias, and the putting him even to a disgraceful death, when he <i>came unto his own,</i> (John i.,) had served to complete their misery. (Haydock) --- Moses resumes his discourse, and says that these chastisements had been reserved in the treasury of God's wrath, and he had not denounced them to their father; but now, since he had told them so plainly, what they had to expect, they would be inexcusable if they ran into the danger. Hebrew may signify, \"The secrets of the Lord....are manifest to us.\" He has shewn us this favour, in preference to other nations, Psalm cxlvi. 20. (Vatable) --- Secret things are known to God, while those only which are manifest can be discerned by men. (Theodoret, q. 38.) (Worthington) --- Amama wonders at the <i>negligence</i> of B. Luther's version; and observes, that his commentators illustrate \"the word of Luther, not of God,\" in this place, p. 378. (Haydock)"

        - "DEU:31:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>This law</i> of Deuteronomy. (Menochius) --- Some think that he had written so far before he came to the assembly, as well as the <i>Canticle;</i> because God commanded him the same day to ascend the mount, chap. xxxii. 48. (Calmet) --- But Moses did not speak the discourses recorded in this book, at one time. After he had, therefore, dismissed the people with his blessing, and with an assurance that God would be with their newly appointed leader, he committed to writing what he had delivered by God's order, at different times, and gave a copy of the Pentateuch to the priests, who were to keep it carefully on the side of the ark, and explain it to the people, particularly every seventh year. The Jews understand <i>this law</i> to mean the whole Pentateuch. It may denote also, more particularly (Haydock) Deuteronomy, as far as this place, or the 27th, and three subsequent chapters of it. He gave two copies; one to be deposited beside the ark, and the other (ver. 26,) to be kept by the priests. In all contracts of consequence, this method is observed, one copy being laid carefully by, and the other left in the hands of those who may be concerned, Jeremias xxxii. 12. The Rabbins say that 13 copies were taken; one for each of the 12 tribes, and one to be placed on the side of the ark. But of this new assertion we must not expect to hear any proof. --- <em>Priests</em>, whose duty it is to instruct the people, Malachias ii. 7. (Calmet) --- <i>Ancients,</i> or magistrates, who must put the law in execution, and guide their decisions by it. (Haydock) --- The mention of the <i>ark</i> in this place, is to insinuate that the book was to be deposited on one side of it, ver. 26. The priests might carry the ark, if they thought proper, (Menochius) as they did sometimes on the more solemn occasions; (Josue ii., and vi., and 1 Kings iv. 4,) though the duty belonged to the Levites, Numbers iii., and iv. The pagans placed their sacred books in their temples, under the care of the priests, who were obliged to transcribe them. (Calmet)"
      v:010:
        - 'DEU:31:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Years</i> commenced. Hebrew, "at the extremity of seven years." The sabbatic years began at the expiration of every six years, (Haydock) after the land of Chanaan was conquered, (Calmet) or perhaps after the passage of the Jordan, which took place soon after this discourse was made. Josue spent above six years in the conquest of the country, and then divided it among the tribes. The seventh year was the first <i>year of remission;</i> as the Israelites, particularly on the east side of the Jordan, had already enjoyed the benefits of the country for a considerable time. If they had been required to wait till the whole had been conquered, no sabbatical year would have been of obligation before the reign of Solomon, as he had still some of the devoted nations to subdue. See Exodus xxiii., and Leviticus xxv. (Salien, in the year before Christ 1463) At this time, the ark was removed from Galgala to Silo, where it remained about 350 years, Josue xviii. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - 'DEU:31:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Thou shalt.</i> Septuagint, "you shall read." Josephus says, the high priest had to perform this office; while the Rabbins assert, that the chief magistrate, Moses, and his successors, the kings of Juda, had to read the law publicly. The princes did this in the court of the temple, designed for the <i>women,</i> as they also were bound to hear it. We find that Josias read aloud in the temple the words of the covenant, which have been lately discovered, 4 Kings xxiii. 2. (Calmet) --- But Esdras, a Levite, did the like; (1 Esdras viii. 2,) and the command seems to be directed chiefly to the priests, from whose number Moses was not excluded, Psalm xcviii. 6. (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - 'DEU:31:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Children,</i> (<i>parvulis.</i>) Those who were above 12 years of age, attended the festivals as much as possible, particularly the three great ones. Even little children came to the temple, when they did not live at too great a distance. The lawgiver knew of what importance it was to inspire their tender minds with a love and respect for religion, and for the laws. (Calmet)'
      v:014:
        - 'DEU:31:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>In the</i> court, as none but priests were allowed to enter the <i>tabernacle.</i> (Menochius)'
      v:017:
        - 'DEU:31:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>My face,</i> as one indignant and much displeased. (Calmet) --- I will withdraw my special protection and favours from them. (Menochius)'
      v:019:
        - "DEU:31:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>This canticle,</i> which will be given in the following chapter. Hence this law, (ver. 9,) may comprise not only what had gone before, but also the remaining part of the book of Deuteronomy. This Moses would write before his death, and deliver entire, with the preceding books, to be kept with the utmost care, by the priests, as a <i>testimony</i> to remind all of what had happened in past ages, and what would befall the transgressors of God's law. (Haydock) --- The canticle, containing an abridgment of the book of Deuteronomy, (Calmet) as the latter did of the whole law, was to be copied out more frequently, (Haydock) and committed to memory. Some suppose that Moses and Josue are here ordered to see this put in execution. Others think that Moses gives this commission to the priests. --- <i>That they.</i> Hebrew, \"put it in their mouths, (Calmet) that this song may be a witness for me against,\" &c. God foresaw that the Israelites would prove rebellious; but he leaves them without excuse, as they could not plead ignorance. (Haydock) --- This testimony against them was written in the form of a canticle, that it might be more easily remembered. (Worthington)"
      v:020:
        - 'DEU:31:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Despise,</i> (<i>detrahent</i>,) "detract," (Haydock) and represent me as an unjust and weak God. Hebrew, "they will despise, or blaspheme," &c. Septuagint, "they will irritate me." (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - 'DEU:31:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Thoughts.</i> Hebrew, "imagination." Septuagint, "wickedness." --- <i>Them.</i> Hebrew, "concerning which I swore." Septuagint add, "to their fathers." (Haydock)'
      v:023:
        - 'DEU:31:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>The Lord.</i> Hebrew has not this word, so that it would seem as if <em>Moses</em> had given this charge to Josue; but the context shews (Calmet) that it was the Lord; (ver. 14.) for he swore to give the land of Israel. The Septuagint insert the words Moses and the Lord. "And Moses commanded Josue....the land which the Lord swore." (Haydock) --- This is the first time that God addresses Josue, in order to confirm his authority. (Menochius)'
      v:026:
        - 'DEU:31:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Side.</i> But not within, (Menochius) according to the generality of interpreters, whom Calmet follows, Exodus xxv. 10. But here he adopts the contrary opinion of <i>Jonathan</i> and Grotius, and asserts that this writing, containing the 29th, 30th, and 31st chapters, on thin boards, was placed in the ark, beside the tables of the law, in the same manner as the Philistines placed it in a coffer of gold, 1 Kings vi. 8. We read (3 Kings viii. 9,) that there was <i>nothing in the ark except the two tables,</i> which might be true at the time that book was written; though St. Paul (Hebrews ix. 4,) tells us, that <i>the golden pot, and the rod of Aaron,</i> were <i>in</i> the <i>ark.</i> If they were there in the days when the author of the first book of Kings lived, the passage in question must be understood with these exceptions. (Calmet) --- This difficulty cannot, however, be now easily decided, as the Scripture often uses the word <i>in</i> to denote near to, &c., ver. 14. The coffer of the Philistines might also be on the <i>outside</i> of the ark. (Haydock) --- <i>Thee.</i> This act of ratification of the covenant, which had been made at Horeb, 39 years before, (Calmet) was placed in or near the ark. (Haydock) --- The three chapters, of which it probably consisted, seem to have been what was discovered in the reign of Josias; as the threats and blessings which they contain, would naturally tend to make a strong impression upon all, 4 Kings xxii. 8. (Calmet) --- Kennicott thinks that Helcias discovered the very manuscript, which Moses had written with his own hand, and which he deposited neither in, nor fastened to any side of the ark, but only placed by the side (<i>mitsad, juxta,</i> Noldius) of it, or upon the same table; so that it might not be taken by the Philistines, but kept in some suitable place. (Dis. ii.) It is surprising that Huet cites Jonathan as delivering this sentiment, <i>in capsâad latus dextrum.</i> (Haydock)'

      v:001:
        - 'DEU:32:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Speak.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "Heaven attend, and I will speak." (Haydock) --- Never was there an exordium more pompous, or better adapted to the subject. Moses calls those who never die to witness what he asserts, as if to insinuate that these truths ought never to be forgotten. See Numbers iv. 6. Virgil (Æneid xii.) imitates this style, <i>Esto nunc sol testis & hæc mihi terra precanti,</i> (Calmet) which he puts in the mouth of Æneas, to whom Latinus replies, <i>Hæc eadem Ænea, terram, mare, sidera juro.</i>'
      v:002:
        - 'DEU:32:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Gather,</i> as rain does from vapours; (Menochius) so let the sum of what I have taught you be collected into this short canticle, and penetrate your hearts. (Haydock) --- Chaldean, "may my discourse be as delightful as the rain." Septuagint, "may my apophthegm (or sententious discourse, Calmet) be expected with earnestness, like rain," when the soil is thirsty. (Haydock) --- Preachers are compared to clouds, and their speech to rain, Isaias lx. 8., and Ecclesiasticus xxxix. 4. --- <i>Drops.</i> Some explain this and the former term in the original, of "a stormy and vehement shower," while others attach this idea only to the last part of the sentence. (Calmet) --- The lawgiver wishes to engage the hearts of his audience by mildness, though he is forced also to thunder, in order to rouse their attention, ver. 15. (Haydock) --- Sound doctrine produces much fruit in good dispositions, as rain causeth the seed to push forth which has been sown in an excellent soil. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - 'DEU:32:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Invoke,</i> or praise. (Vatable) --- <i>Magnificence;</i> admire and fear his greatness. (Calmet) --- The first duty of men is to praise God, the next to confess their sins, ver. 5. (Worthington)'
      v:004:
        - 'DEU:32:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Right.</i> You cannot complain of having been first abandoned by God. All his works and proceedings are entitled to praise. Hebrew, "This rock, (<i>hatsur</i>) his works are perfect." (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "God, his works are true." (Haydock) --- God is often styled a <i>rock,</i> to denote this strength, ver. 18., and Psalm lxii. 8.'
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:32:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Filth,</i> or idolatry. The fidelity of God is contrasted with the infidelity of his people, who deserve not to be called his children. The Septuagint, Chaldean, Syriac, and Arabic, seem to have read in a different manner from what the Hebrew does at present. (Calmet) --- As it stands it is quite unintelligible: <i>Corrupit, non filii ejus, macula eorum.</i> Two letters have been carelessly inserted, and <i>la</i> has been placed after <i>lu,</i> contrary to the Samaritan text, which is perfectly clear: "They are corrupted, they are not his, <i>but filii maculæ,</i> children defiled." (Houbigant, prol. 75.) --- Capellus (p. 288,) condemns the Septuagint as he follows a wrong punctuation, and translates, "they did not sin against him, reprehensible children;" whereas, it more properly signifies, "they sinned, not his, <i>but</i> children deserving reprehension, (<i>or</i> children of blame, they did not belong or stick close to him) being a crooked and perverse generation." (Haydock) --- Their wickedness cannot be attributed to God. He is no less powerful and holy, though they have given themselves up to the service of idols. (St. Augustine, q. 55.) (Calmet) --- He had given them all necessary instructions and assistance; so that, finding them always prone to evil, the more favours he heaped upon them, he was on the point of exterminating all the guilty at once, ver. 26. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - 'DEU:32:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Possessed thee,</i> as his peculiar inheritance. (Menochius) --- Hebrew, "has purchased thee, made thee, and established thee." The Septuagint render this last word like the Vulgate as they seem to have read, <i>ibnoc.</i> (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - 'DEU:32:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Israel.</i> He suffered the people of Chanaan to occupy as much land as would be requisite for the Israelites. Septuagint, "according to the number of the angels of God." Hence many of the ancients gathered that there were seventy angel guardians of provinces, and as many languages; while others did not pretend to determine the exact number. But the version which they have followed, is in opposition to all the rest. (Calmet) --- They have also disputed on this occasion, whether the elect will be equal in number to the good angels, as St. Gregory thinks; (hom. 34, in Luke xv.) or they will only fill up the places of those who have fallen. See Mag. Sent. ii. 9. Abenezra observes, that interpreters understand this text as alluding to the dispersion of nations, (Genesis xi.) when God decreed that the land of the seven nations should belong to and be sufficient for the Israelites. (Amama) (Haydock) --- The Hebrew may be rendered, "He fixed the limits of each people. At that time the children of Israel were few in number, (<strong>9</strong>) when the Lord chose his people," &c. Long after the division of the earth, (which the Lord had ordered, Acts xvii. 26,) the Israelites were very few in number, as Jacob observes, Genesis xxxiv. 30. See chap. xxvi. 5., and Psalm civ. 9, 12. (Calmet) --- But this explication does not satisfy Houbigant, (p. 76, Prol.) no more than that of Le Clerc. He is convinced that a word has been transposed, and another left out, as the Samaritan copy has Israel twice, and he would therefore translate, "He divided his people according to the number of the sons of Israel." In his eternal decrees, He allotted twelve portions of land in Chanaan to the descendants of Jacob, and these Josue was ordered to mark out for them. See Josue iv. 5. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - 'DEU:32:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Lot.</i> Hebrew literally, "the cord," in allusion to the ancient method of dividing lands with a cord. Herodotus (ii. 6,) observes, that the length of one, in the Upper Egypt, was 60 stadia, or 7700 paces, while it was only half as much in the Lower Egypt.'
      v:010:
        - 'DEU:32:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>He found.</i> Septuagint and Chaldean, "he gave him what was sufficient, in the desert land." God made a choice of a nation destitute of every thing, that they might confess with gratitude that they had received all from him. (Calmet) --- "Taught him" both by "instructions," and by various "chastisements." Septuagint, <i>epaideusen.</i> (Haydock) --- The space of forty years was necessary (Calmet) to eradicate the propensity to evil, and the corrupt manners of the Hebrews, who were therefore conducted through a wilderness, where they might not be contaminated by the company of other nations, (Haydock) but might have leisure to meditate on the law of God. (Calmet) --- <i>Eye,</i> with the utmost care. (Menochius) --- He protected those whom he had chosen out of pure mercy. (Worthington)'
      v:011:
        - 'DEU:32:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Shoulders,</i> as (Exodus xix. 4,) upon <i>the wings of eagles.</i> It is said that the eagle hovers over the nest, to encourage her young ones to fly, and when she sees them exhausted, she takes them upon her back. This similitude shews the extreme affection of God towards his people. Hebrew and Chaldean may also be, "as an eagle makes (Calmet; or stirs up) her nest, hatches her young, spreads her wings over them, and bears them upon her wings, <i>so</i> the Lord alone was his leader." (Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - 'DEU:32:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>With him,</i> to stand up in their defence, though the Israelites adored but too many others in the desert.'
      v:013:
        - 'DEU:32:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>High land,</i> in a place of safety, both against the enemy, and the inundations of water. The Nile renders Egypt like one continued sea for about 80 days, in the summer season. (Calmet) --- God had already begun to put the Israelites in possession of the fertile countries east of the Jordan, where there were several high mountains. (Haydock) --- But when this canticle should be recited, in after ages, they would also enjoy the other regions, which had been promised unto them, on the west. Moses speaks, like a prophet, of things to come, as if they were already past. (Menochius) --- <i>Stone.</i> Bees make honey in such places, and olive trees flourish on the side of a hill. Vestiges still remain of the industry with which the Jews have formerly cultivated their territory, supporting the earth with walls (Calmet) when it was in danger of falling down, or of becoming barren, for want of moisture. (Haydock)'
      v:014:
        - 'DEU:32:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Butter</i> or "cream," as the former article was probably not yet discovered, Genesis xviii. 8. (Calmet) --- The proofs of this assertion, from the original, <i>chemath,</i> and from the Scripture, frequently representing butter as a <i>liquid,</i> seem not, however, very solid. See Judges v. 25., and Proverbs xxx. 33. The Septuagint have literally, "the butter of oxen," but the latter name includes all of the species. (Haydock) --- <i>Basan.</i> The Septuagint have, "the young of bulls and of he-goats;" though they generally translate "fat sheep." See St. Jerome in Isaias liii. --- <i>Wheat.</i> Hebrew, "fat of the kidneys of wheat." --- <i>Grape.</i> See Genesis xlix. 11. Androcides wrote to Alexander, who loved wine too much, "when thou art about to drink wine, remember, O king, that thou art drinking the blood of the earth." (Pliny, [Natural History?] xiv. 15.)'

        - 'DEU:32:15 | 15 | 15 | Beloved. Hebrew <i>yeshurun,</i> is supposed to be a diminutive of Israel, chap. xxxiii. 5., and 26. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked; thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered <i>with fatness;</i> then he forsook God, <i>which</i> made him, and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation." This sudden change of persons is not found in the Septuagint. "And Jacob eat, and was filled, and the beloved kicked; he grew fat, thick, and broad, and he abandoned God....and revolted from God his Saviour." (Haydock) --- Temporal prosperity occasioned the revolt of the Jews against their benefactor. (Worthington)'
      v:017:
        - 'DEU:32:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Devils.</i> Hebrew, "to the destroyers, <i>or</i> to those of the fields." See Leviticus xvii. 7., and Baruch iv. 7, 35. (Calmet) --- <i>Knew not.</i> Septuagint, "revered not." (Haydock) --- Hebrew may be, "who knew them not," who had bestowed nothing upon them, chap. xxix. 26. --- <i>Come up.</i> Hebrew, "of the neighbourhood;" gods whose origin they knew, (Calmet) as well as the people who had given them that title; (Haydock) gods of human invention. (Menochius) --- Novelty allureth to the worship of idols and to heresy. (Worthington)'
      v:018:
        - 'DEU:32:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Created.</i> Septuagint, "gave thee food." Hebrew, "of the rock that begat thee, thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee, (Haydock) or praises thee," the source of thy felicity. (Calmet) --- Calvin (Institutes i. 11. 9[19?],) to insinuate that Catholics adore pictures, as the Israelites did the golden calf, pretends that they could not have forgotten that God delivered them out of Egypt. Thus he contradicts the Scriptures! (Worthington)'
      v:019:
        - 'DEU:32:19 | 19 | 19 | <i>Daughters.</i> The women of Israel, who were not less addicted to idolatry than the men. (Haydock)'
      v:020:
        - 'DEU:32:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>From them.</i> The Jews themselves acknowledged, in the siege of Jerusalem, that God had abandoned and given up to destruction his once beloved people. (Josephus, Jewish Wars vii. 8.) (Calmet) --- <i>Consider,</i> or look on their utter ruin with indifference, or rather with complacency. (Haydock) --- <i>I will laugh at your destruction,</i> Proverbs i. 16. (Calmet) --- God loves without seeing any preceding merit in his creatures, but he never abandons them till they have first proved unfaithful. (Worthington)'
      v:021:
        - 'DEU:32:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Vanities.</i> Septuagint, "idols." (Haydock) --- <i>Nation.</i> The Gentiles were of this description, when they were called to the true faith. This excited the indignation of the Jews, as they would neither enter heaven themselves, nor suffer others to obtain that happiness, Romans i. 19. (Theodoret, q. 41.) "An association bound together by law, constitutes a nation. A multitude which has no laws, or bad ones, is unworthy of the name." (Grotius) --- The Jews looked upon all others with sovereign contempt. (Calmet) --- Now, in their turn, they are despised. (Worthington)'
      v:022:
        - 'DEU:32:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>A fire.</i> He alludes to the destruction of Sodom, (Calmet) which may be considered as a figure of that which will overtake the whole world at the last day, and excruciate both the souls and the bodies of the reprobate in the flames of <i>hell.</i> (Haydock) --- Fire also denotes war, the horrors of which overwhelmed the Jews both at the first and the last sieges of Jerusalem. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - 'DEU:32:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Arrows.</i> Pestilence, famine, war, sickness, and death, are termed the arrows of God.'
      v:024:
        - 'DEU:32:24 | 24 | 24 | <i>Birds.</i> This refers in a particular manner to those who are deprived of sepulture, and hung on a gibbet, chap. xxvii. 26. Josephus (Jewish Wars vi. 12,) informs us, that the multitude of Jews who were to be crucified, was so great, that sufficient wood could not be procured to make crosses for them, nor was there place for them to stand. Hebrew, "they shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat;" (Haydock) or with the disease called the carbuncle. (Calmet) --- But the Septuagint and Chaldean explain it of "birds." (Haydock) --- <i>Bite.</i> Septuagint, "with a painful contraction of the nerves." Chaldean, "infested with evil spirits." --- <i>Beasts.</i> Thus God forced the people of Samaria to obey his law, 4 Kings xvii. 25. --- <i>Fury,</i> "venom." (Pagnin) (Menochius)'
      v:026:
        - 'DEU:32:26 | 26 | 26 | <i>Men.</i> Hebrew, "I said I will disperse <i>or</i> exterminate them." Samaritan, "my fury shall consume them." We may translate, "I had resolved to destroy them; <strong>27</strong>. But," &c., (Calmet) or Protestants, "I said I would scatter them into corners, and would....were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy," &c. --- <i>Where are they?</i> in the mouth of God, shews an utter destruction, so that no vestiges of them remain. <i>Their memory is perished.</i> (Haydock) --- God sometimes defers punishing the sinner for just reasons. (Worthington)'
      v:027:
        - 'DEU:32:27 | 27 | 27 | <i>Wrath.</i> The enemies of the Israelites wished nothing more than their destruction. If therefore God had gratified this desire, by punishing his people, as they deserved, the enemy would have presently insinuated, that He had not been able to drive them out, or that (Haydock) he was fickle, &c. --- <i>Mighty.</i> (<i>excelsa;</i>) "lifted up." This expression shews the pride and insolence of those who make use of it, as if they despised God and all his laws. Procopius mentions this wicked inscription, to be still seen at Rome, "I lift up my hands to (or against) God, who destroyed me, though innocent, in the 20th year of my age." Pos. Procius, (Calmet) who seems to have been a woman, <i>quæ vixi,</i> &c. (Haydock)'
      v:028:
        - 'DEU:32:28 | 28 | 28 | <i>Wisdom.</i> Interpreters generally explain this and the eight following verses, of those nations whom God employed to scourge his people, though some understand it all of the Israelites. (Calmet) --- The words may be applied to all who transgress the law of God, as this is a sure mark of folly and impiety, and the Lord earnestly wishes that all should be converted, ver. 29. True wisdom reflects on the past, present, and future, (Worthington) in order to make provision for the last great conflict. (Haydock)'
      v:030:
        - 'DEU:32:30 | 30 | 30 | <i>Thousand.</i> In the battles which the Israelites had fought, the hand of God had appeared so visibly in their defence, giving them the victory over nations much more numerous, (Calmet) that all must confess their defeat must be in punishment of some former transgression, and that it is not the <i>mighty hand</i> of the <i>enemy,</i> but God himself, who chastises his people, as he had foretold, chap. xxviii. 7, 25, 49. (Haydock) --- Of this the neighbouring nations were convinced, as Achior declared to the Holofernes, Judith v. 17. When the Hebrews neglected the law of God they were oppressed, and their conversion was presently rewarded with liberty, (Calmet) and a profusion of blessings.'
      v:031:
        - "DEU:32:31 | 31 | 31 | <i>Judges.</i> The Egyptians, Amalecites, &c., had witnessed the miracles which God had now wrought for 40 years' time, in favour of his people. (Haydock) --- They knew also how the Israelites had been punished for their sins. (Menochius) --- Though they followed a false religion themselves, they could discern the beauty of the true one. (Worthington) --- <i>Video meliora proboque---Deteriora sequor.</i> (Ovid)"
      v:032:
        - 'DEU:32:32 | 32 | 32 | <i>Bitter.</i> The enemies of Israel, were of an accursed progeny. (Haydock) --- They imitated the vices of those wicked cities. Moses cautioned his people to beware of the root of bitterness, chap. xxix. 18. (Calmet) --- If they should neglect the admonition, and become like the Chanaanites, they knew what they had to expect. (Haydock) --- Their works being hateful to the Lord, (Menochius) he would surely punish them. The fruits which grow near the lake of Sodom, though sometimes fair to the eye, (Haydock) are full of dust, "black and empty, they fall to ashes," <i>in cinerem vanescunt.</i> (Tacitus v.; Josephus, Jewish Wars v. 5.) Growing on a bituminous soil, they could not but have a disagreeable taste. (Calmet) --- The authors of the Universal History call in question what the ancients have reported concerning the fruits of Sodom. (Haydock)'
      v:034:
        - 'DEU:32:34 | 34 | 34 | <i>Treasures.</i> Whether we refer to the preceding remarks to the faithless Israelites, whose corruption was less pardonable, as they had received so many favours from above, or to their proud and cruel enemies, who exceeded the bounds of moderation in their wars, God keeps an exact account of all, and will shortly punish both, according to their deserts. (Haydock)'
      v:035:
        - 'DEU:32:35 | 35 | 35 | <i>Time.</i> Men are eager to punish their enemies, for fear lest they should escape. But God defers his chastisements frequently in this world, designing to make his enemies feel the weight of his indignation for all eternity. How consoling it is for the just, to think they have God for an avenger. "If thou, says Tertullian, remit the injury, which thou hast received, into his hands, he is the avenger....How much ought patience to endure, in order to make God a debtor." <i>Adeo satisidoneus patientiæ sequester Deus.</i> --- <i>That.</i> Septuagint, "when" (Calmet) they shall fall and come to ruin. (Menochius)'
      v:036:
        - 'DEU:32:36 | 36 | 36 | <i>People</i> who have been guilty, that he may spare them, when they repent. (Menochius) --- "He will give judgment in favour of his people," &c. (Houbigant) --- <i>Servants.</i> He will not involve the innocent in the ruin of the rebellious. (Menochius) --- But, at the same time, he will have them to be convinced that their salvation came not from themselves. He will assist them when all human aid has proved abortive, (Haydock) and when they are reduced to the utmost distress. See Isaias xxxv. 3., and 3 Kings xxi. 21. Those who may have thought themselves secure in their sins, will not escape punishment. (Worthington)'
      v:038:
        - 'DEU:32:38 | 38 | 38 | <i>Wine.</i> Hence the Jews abhor the wine of Christians, whom they consider as the greatest enemies of God. The pagans were accustomed to make libations to their idols, even in their ordinary repasts. (Calmet) --- The <i>fat</i> was always sacred to God, Leviticus iii. 17. (Menochius)'
      v:040:
        - 'DEU:32:40 | 40 | 40 | <i>For ever.</i> God can swear by no one greater than himself, Hebrews vi. 13.'
      v:041:
        - 'DEU:32:41 | 41 | 41 | <i>Lightning,</i> equally terrible and penetrating: <i>fulminis acta modo.</i> (Virgil, Æneid ix.) (Calmet) --- <em>Judgment</em>, to punish with rigour my declared enemies. (Haydock) --- These verses seem to regard the idolatrous nations, (Menochius) though God will not fail to punish the guilty, wherever they may be found. (Haydock)'
      v:042:
        - 'DEU:32:42 | 42 | 42 | <i>Enemies.</i> I will tear the crown from off their head. Chaldean, I will destroy the king, as well as the meanest captives. Protestants, "from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy." At the very first I will completely destroy them. (Haydock) --- I will punish them for the slaughter and captivity of my people, whom they have shaved, as a mark of their servile condition. (Menochius) --- Their bare head, or vain counsels, will be detected and punished. (Worthington)'
      v:043:
        - "DEU:32:43 | 43 | 43 | <i>People.</i> Though God afflicted the Israelites for a time, he was always disposed to receive them to his favour again, upon their repentance; and he will even receive them into his Church, before the day of judgment, Romans xi. 25. (Calmet) --- This decided predilection for them, would naturally induce other nations to <i>praise</i> them. Grabe's Septuagint reads, \"Rejoice ye heavens with him, and let all the sons of God adore him, and let all the angels of God strengthen them, because He revengeth the blood of his sons; and he will continue to do so, and he will punish his enemies, and will render to those who hate him; and the Lord will purify the land of his people.\" (Haydock) --- In some editions of the Septuagint, after <i>Let all the angels of God adore him,</i> (cited [in] Hebrews i. 6.; Cappel.) they read, <i>Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people,</i> which St. Paul quotes, Romans xv. 10; and then they add, \"And Moses wrote this canticle on that day, and he taught it to the children of Israel; (Calmet) <strong>44</strong>. and Moses came forth to the people, and spoke all the words of this law, in the ears of the people, he and Jesus, the son of Nave,\" by which name they designate <i>Josue, the son of Nun.</i> (Haydock) --- He assisted Moses in singing the canticle, as his colleague in office, to whom the obligation of withdrawing the people from idolatry would henceforth devolve. (Menochius) --- God always preserved some of the Jews from the general corruption, till the time of the Messias. (Worthington)"
      v:047:
        - 'DEU:32:47 | 47 | 47 | <i>Live.</i> Hebrew, "it is your life." They were to cherish the law as their own lives; for their prosperity and length of days depended on their observance of it.'
      v:049:
        - DEU:32:49 | 49 | 49 | <i>Passages.</i> The author of the Vulgate has given this explication of <i>Abarim.</i> (Calmet)
      v:051:
        - 'DEU:32:51 | 51 | 51 | <i>Cades.</i> Hebrew, "at the waters of Meriba-Cadesh," &c.'
      v:052:
        - 'DEU:32:52 | 52 | 52 | <i>Into it.</i> By repeating this reproach and judgment, God excited in his servant the most lively sentiments of repentance for his fault, Numbers xx. (Haydock) --- Aaron had been deprived of the sight of this delightful country. If they had been labouring for its acquisition alone, the reflection must have been very cutting. But they had a better country in view, though they had greatly desired to enter into that land which was to be ennobled and purified by the birth and blood of the Son of God. (Haydock) --- Having received the order from God in the evening, after Moses had taught his canticle to the people, he immediately set his house in order, and on the following morning he gave his last blessing to the tribes of Israel, and was attended by the chiefs to the foot of the mountain. (Salien)'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - 'DEU:33:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Blessing.</i> The Fathers, St. Augustine, (q. 56,) &c., explain this of the Christian Church, rather than of the Synagogue. (Theodoret) --- <i>Man of God.</i> A title given to a prophet, 1 Kings ii. 27., and ix. 6. The prophets often speak of things to come, as if they were past, as we have seen in the conduct of Balaam, Numbers xxiv. 3. Moses here delivers his last testament, and speaks as one no longer in the world, so that there is no reason to affirm that this chapter has been added by another hand; (Calmet) though Kennicott thinks it probable. He suggests, that the first verses of this blessing have been corrupted in the Hebrew and should be translated: <b>2.</b> He, Jehovah, came from Sinai, and he arose upon them from Seir; (Judges v. 4.) <b>3.</b> He shone forth from Mount Pharan, and he came from Meriba-Cadesh. (Numbers xx. 1. 13.) From his right hand a fire shone forth upon them. <b>4.</b> Truly he loved the people, and he blessed all his saints. <b>5.</b> For they fell down at his feet, and they received of his words. <b>6.</b> He commanded us a law, the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. <b>7.</b> And He became king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were assembled, together with the tribes of Israel. See (Dis. i. p. 423,) the arguments which he produces in favour of this version. (Haydock)'
      v:002:
        - 'DEU:33:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Pharan.</i> Habacuc iii. 3, mentions this apparition. See also Psalm lxvii. 9. --- <i>Saints.</i> God was accompanied by legions of angels, when he delivered the law to the Israelites, who are styled a nation of saints, Numbers xvi. 3. Septuagint, "he hastened from Mount Pharan, with ten thousands to Cades. At his right hand are his angels attending." (Haydock) --- <i>Kodesh</i> does not mean <i>saints,</i> but holiness, or the city of Cades; and the preceding word, which Protestants translate, <i>with ten thousands,</i> more probably refers to another title of the city, as it is specified Meriba-Cadesh, chap. xxxii. 51., and Ezechiel xlviii. 28. (Kennicott) --- <i>Law.</i> Chaldean, "from the midst of the fire he has given us a law, written with his own hand." We may translate, "He hath shone from Mount Pharan, and multitudes accompanied him. The Holy One, who hath in his hand fire and the law." See Isaias vi. 3. God conducted his people, like a victorious general, through the wilderness, frequently appearing to them to strike terror into the rebellious. (Calmet) --- When he first descended upon Sinai, his glory shone on Pharan and Seir, as it were in its progress thither. (Menochius) --- The <i>law</i> is styled <i>fiery,</i> not only because it was given from the midst of flames, but also because it was to be put in execution with the utmost rigour. (Haydock) --- But <i>doth</i> is Chaldean, and no where else used for the <i>law</i> in the books written before the captivity, nor is it acknowledged by the Septuagint, Syriac, &c. Perhaps it was originally <i>aur,</i> as it is in the Samaritan version, "<i>shone forth</i>," conformably to a similar passage, Habacuc iii. 4. "His brightness was as the sun, <i>horns,</i> or rather splendours (issuing forth) from his hand," &c. (Kennicott)'
      v:003:
        - "DEU:33:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>People,</i> (<i>populos</i>.) God loves and watches over all, but particularly (Calmet) over the nation which he has chosen. (Chaldean) See Wisdom iii. 1., and Isaias xlix. 16. --- <i>Doctrine.</i> It was formerly the custom for disciples to sit at their master's feet, (Acts xxii. 3,) as it is still in the eastern countries. (Bellon. iii. 12.) Septuagint, \"and these are under thee;\" (Haydock) subject to thy orders. (Calmet) --- Hebrew is here extremely confused: \"Yea, he loved the people; all his saints <i>are</i> in thy hand, and they eat down at thy feet; <i>every one</i> shall receive of thy words.\" Moses here addresses the Lord. How could he say therefore, <i>all his,</i> &c.? whose <i>saints,</i> and in whose hand? The Vulgate and Chaldean have not the same difficulty, as they read, <i>in his hand, bidu.</i> But the Syriac has, \"and he blessed all his saints.\" <i>Boroc</i> is not very unlike the present Hebrew <i>bidoc,</i> (Kennicott) <i>r</i> and <i>d</i> being frequently mistaken for each other, and <i>i</i> as often neglected by the Hebrew copyists. (Haydock) --- The Samaritan version confirms this alteration; and the text also has the <i>v, and,</i> at the beginning, which makes the whole to be clearly connected, particularly if we allow that <i>c,</i> which stands for <i>thy,</i> has been substituted for <i>v, his,</i> in the following words, <i>thy feet</i> and <i>thy words,</i> which ought to be <i>his,</i> as all the context speaks of God in the third person. This is agreeable to the Vulgate and to the Septuagint also, in the last instance. In the former, the Hebrew is printed <i>thy foot,</i> though the Samaritan and several manuscripts read <i>thy feet.</i> Instead of <i>yissa,</i> \"he shall receive,\" (Haydock) the plural ought to be substituted, <i>v</i> being omitted both at the beginning and end, as it is in the name of Benaihu, 1 Paralipomenon xi. 22. See 2 Kings xxiii. 20. The Samaritan, Syriac, and Arabic, read <i>and they received,</i> (Kennicott) and the Vulgate, <i>they shall receive.</i> The Septuagint seem to refer this to Moses, \"And Moses received from his words, the law which he enjoined to us.\" (Haydock) --- That <i>Moses</i> should speak of himself, in this manner, seems very unaccountable, and therefore a word may perhaps have crept in, on account of its resemblance with the following term, <i>Mursse.</i> If it has not, Moses must have assumed the title of <i>king,</i> (ver. 5,) which he seems nevertheless to have disclaimed; (chap. xvii. 14,) and there was none in Israel before Saul, 1 Kings viii. 7. (Kennicott) --- We may, however, suppose that he puts these words in the mouths of the people, who would repeat this blessing after he was dead, and mention with gratitude, how Moses had delivered to them so excellent a law, and administered the affairs of state with all the power and dignity of a king. (Haydock)"
      v:004:
        - 'DEU:33:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Moses.</i> He expresses himself as if the people were speaking. The change of persons is very frequent in this discourse. --- <i>Inheritance.</i> So the psalmist (Psalm cxviii. 111,) says, <i>I have purchased thy testimonies for an inheritance for ever.</i> (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - 'DEU:33:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>He shall,</i> &c. <i>Erit rex,</i> may perhaps be as well rendered indefinitely, "There shall be a king;" or, with the Septuagint, "And there shall be over the beloved a ruler," as (Haydock) some understand this of Moses, others of Saul, though it most probably refers to God himself, who gave the law, and was acknowledged, in the most solemn manner, for the king of <i>Israel.</i> --- <i>Right.</i> Hebrew <i>yishurun,</i> a term which St. Jerome translates, with the Septuagint, (Calmet) chap. xxxii. 15, <i>the beloved,</i> as it is supposed to be a diminutive of Israel, to express greater tenderness. Thus Cicero called his daughter Tulliola. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - "DEU:33:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Number.</i> This is conformable to the prophecy of Jacob, who deprived Ruben of his birth-right, on account of incest. He is even treated with indulgence, in being permitted to form one of the tribes. Yet some copies of the Septuagint, Syriac, (Theodoret q. 42,) and many interpreters, take this in a quite contrary sense, \"let him be numerous, or not few;\" the negation being supplied from the former part of the verse, which is not unusual in Hebrew. See Genesis ii. 6., Psalm ix. 19., and Proverbs xxxi. 1, &c. The tribe of Ruben was in effect more numerous than those of Gad, Joseph, or Benjamin. Simeon receives no blessing, probably on account of the crimes for which so many of that tribe were exterminated, (Numbers i. 23., and xxvi. 14.; Calmet,) and particularly Zambri, one of the chief princes, Numbers xxv. (Worthington) --- But Grabe's Septuagint applies to Simeon what the rest attribute to Ruben. \"And let Simeon be many in number.\" No solid reason can be given why he should be passed over entirely, as, notwithstanding the infidelity of some of his children, and his own cruelty in not endeavouring to rescue Joseph, &c., he was to form a tribe among his brethren. (Haydock) --- Some, therefore, imagine that he was to share in the blessings of Ruben, or of Levi, (with whom he is joined by Jacob, Genesis xlix. 5,) or of Juda, near whom he had his allotment of the promised land. Part of the tribe of Simeon afterwards dwelt in the territories of Juda, Josue xix. 1., 1 Paralipomenon iv. 42., and Judges i. 3. But (Calmet) it is more likely that the name has been omitted or changed in the original, by the mistake of some early transcriber, in like manner as the tribe of Manasses, included in that of <i>Joseph,</i> seems to have been placed for that of Dan, which otherwise would be omitted, Apocalypse vii. 6, 8. Some have recourse to a mystery in both these places. (Haydock)"
      v:007:
        - "DEU:33:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Of Juda,</i> \"when he goes to war, and bring him back in peace to his people.\" (Onkelos) --- The general made a solemn prayer on such occasions; and the Psalm xix. was composed, and is still used, to draw down God's blessing in times of war. Moses thus clearly insinuates that the tribe of Juda should obtain the sovereign authority, though it would not be without opposition, that Israel would submit to David. He begs that God would remove all obstacles. This tribe was always distinguished for its valour. It was directed by God to attack the Chanaanites, under Othoniel, Judges i. 2. But its chief glory appeared under the reigns of David and Solomon. The other tribes were scarcely a match for the single tribe of Juda. (Calmet) --- <i>And he,</i> God. (Menochius) --- <i>If God be for us, who is against us?</i> (Romans viii. 31.) (Haydock)"
      v:008:
        - 'DEU:33:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Holy man.</i> Aaron and his successors in the priesthood. (Challoner) --- They were adorned with the Urim and Thummim, which are here rendered <i>perfection</i> and <i>doctrine.</i> (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "give to Levi his insignia, (<i>délous</i>) and his truth, to the holy man, the same whom they tried at the temptation, they spoke ill of him at the waters," &c. It was in consequence of the seditious conduct of the Israelites that the two brothers betrayed a want of confidence in God, and were excluded from the land of promise, as Moses often reminds them, chap. iii. 26. (Haydock) --- <i>Temptation.</i> The place which goes by this name is at Raphidim, near Horeb, Exodus xvii. 6. But the word here probably includes all the other places, where the Hebrews tempted God, and particularly that, where so holy a man as Aaron was permitted to fall. (Calmet) (Numbers xx. 12.) --- The priesthood is the peculiar blessing and honour of the tribe of Levi. (Menochius)'
      v:009:
        - "DEU:33:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Who hath said,</i> &c. It is the duty of the priestly tribe to prefer God's honour and service before all considerations of flesh and blood: in such manner as to behave as strangers to their nearest akin, when these would withdraw them from the business of their calling. (Challoner) --- The Levites shewed no mercy to such of their brethren as had adored the golden calf, Exodus xxxii. 28, 29. The Chaldean, and many able interpreters, consider them here as judges, who must not be biased in passing sentence, by any natural affection. (Vatable) --- Others think they must not assist at the funerals of their relations, Leviticus xxi. 10. (Calmet) --- But the two former opinions seem much better. (Haydock) --- <i>Covenant.</i> Priests ought to be more exemplary in their conduct than other men. (Worthington) --- It is their duty also to instruct others, and to inculcate the observance of the law, as Hebrew and Septuagint more clearly specify. \"They shall teach thy judgments to Jacob, and thy law to Israel.\" (Haydock) --- They were appointed judges (chap. xvii. 8., and xix. 17,) and monitors, Osee iv. 6., &c."

(Haydock)'
      v:012:
        - "DEU:33:12 | 12 | 12 | <i>Shall dwell,</i> &c. This seems to allude to the temple being built in the confines of the tribe of Benjamin, (Challoner) on the northern part of Jerusalem. The southern division of the city was in the territory of Juda; and hence Jerusalem is attributed to both, Josue xv. 63., and Judges i. 21. (Calmet) --- <i>He rest.</i> The temple was situated on Mount Moria, which was higher than the rest of the city, as the head is above the <i>shoulders.</i> (Menochius) --- Chaldean, \"The majesty of the Lord shall dwell in his land.\" This was the sure ground of confidence to Benjamin. As long as God continued with his people, they had nothing to fear, no more than in a bride-chamber, being under the protection of the most High. (Haydock) --- As Benjamin had been the object of his father's love, so God chose the first king out of his tribe; (Menochius) and by protecting his temple in a more particular manner, secured him.

(Challoner) --- Joseph was <i>distinguished</i> by God, by his father, and by the king of Egypt, in a particular manner. The high priest was the <i>Nasir</i> in the house of God, (Leviticus xxi. 12,) as Joseph ws the chief officer, at the court of Pharao. The eastern kings still give this title to their prime minister.

Thus "his beauty, like the finest bullock." The Egyptians had a high esteem for bulls; and Elian (ii. 10,) informs us that Mnevis, one of their kings, ordered the people to adore the bull, as the most beautiful of animals. Moses points at the kingdom of Israel, which was chiefly governed by the tribe of Ephraim; or perhaps he alludes to Josue, (Calmet) who was to succeed him, and to conquer the nations on the other side of the Jordan, with so much resolution and ability. (Haydock) --- <i>Rhinoceros,</i> as stronger and more penetrating. See Numbers xxxii. 22. (Calmet) --- <i>Horns,</i> designate strength and beauty, Psalm lxxiv. (Menochius) --- <i>Push,</i> alluding to the manner in which bulls attack their opponents, and hurl them into the air, <i>sparsâ ad pugnam proludit arenâ.</i> (Georg. iii.) (Calmet) --- Some of the Fathers have explained this passage of Jesus Christ, the first-born of the creation, who is possessed of all the treasures of wisdom (Haydock) and beauty, whose strength drew all things to himself, after he had lifted up the nations on his cross, as it were with horns, and rescued them from the power of the devil.

(Menochius) --- Perhaps this may allude also to their conduct in the war against Jabin, in which they were particularly active, appointing the place of rendezvous at Mount Thabor, where, though the Scripture be silent, it is probable they would offer a sacrifice of thanks, as they had the prophetess, Debora, along with them, (Calmet) in like manner as Samuel immolated a calf at Bethlehem, (1 Kings xvi.) and Elias a bullock on Mount Carmel, 3 Kings xviii. (Haydock) See 1 Kings xiii. 12. --- <i>Sands.</i> This blessing chiefly regarded Zabulon, who received the riches of the sea by commerce, bringing home the gold dust which is found among the sand of some rivers. The river Belus, near Ptolemais, was particularly famous for a sort of sand, of which glass was made. Josephus (Jewish Wars ii. 17,) says, that near the tomb of Memnon, a bed of such sand is found, about 100 cubits long, which, though many vessels have been filled from it, has never been exhausted. See Pliny, [Natural History?] v. 19., and Strabo, xvi. --- The discovery of glass is supposed to have been the effect of chance; some merchants having placed a nitrous stone under their pot, as soon as it grew hot, and mixed with the sand, which is found near the shore of Tyre, a transparent substance was formed, which the Greeks called <i>ualos,</i> "glass," perhaps in imitation of the Hebrew <i>éul,</i> or "sand," of which it was chiefly composed. (Calmet) --- The Septuagint render this verse, "They shall destroy the nations, and you shall call thither, and there you shall sacrifice,....because the riches of the sea shall suckle thee, and the merchandise of those who inhabit the sea shore." These tribes greatly contributed to overthrow the army of Sisara beside the torrent of Cisson, which divides their territories, Judges iv., and v. (Haydock)'

Septuagint, "And he saw his first-fruits," (the first conquered country of Sehon and of Og) because there the land of the princes was divided, the leaders of the people being assembled, <i>or</i> who were assembled with the leaders. (Haydock) --- Gad and the two other tribes petitioned for that part of the country, and obtained their request of Moses, Numbers xxxii. 27. --- <i>Israel.</i> This is generally understood of Moses; but it may be explained of the tribe of Gad, which complied with the conditions imposed on him, and on his brethren, by the Lord, when he allotted the land of Galaad to them, chap. iii. 18. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "he executed the justice of the Lord," &c. Septuagint, "the Lord did justice and his judgment with Israel," approving his choice. (Haydock)'

        - 'DEU:33:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Basan.</i> As the Jordan rushes with impetuosity (Haydock) from Lais, which was seized by some of this tribe; (Judges xviii.) and as a lion falls on its prey from the mountains of Basan, so shall this tribe give birth to Samson, who was stronger than a lion, (Calmet) and terribly harassed the Philistines, Judges xiv. 5, 14, &c. When the Danites found themselves straitened for room, they sent a colony, (Haydock) which took possession of Lais, and called it after their own name: one of the fountains of the Jordan was in this place, the other was called Jor, (Menochius) though the river may have a more distant and obscure source in the lake of Phiala, whence Josephus says (Haydock) it runs by a subterraneous passage, to a fountain of Dan. As it then takes its course through the promised land, of which it is the principal river, Dan may thus be said to supply waters abundantly for the whole country. (Menochius) --- But the Hebrew and Septuagint have, "he shall leap from Basan," which must be understood of the lion, since the territory of Dan was very remote from that mountain. (Haydock)'

(Josephus, Jewish Wars vii. 3.) --- But this custom was not peculiar to the soldiers. People of all descriptions did the like, either for ornament, or to make their sandals last longer. Empedocles wore brass at the bottom of his sandals; (Laert. viii.) and as one of them was thrown out from the top of Mount Etna, it was discovered that he had destroyed himself in that volcano, to make people suppose (Calmet) that he was a god, and had gone up to heaven. (Haydock) --- St. Clement of Alexandria (Pœd. ii.) complains, that some wore such gaudy ornaments in his days. (Calmet) --- This passage is interpreted in a figurative sense by some, as if Aser would trample under his feet and despise the instruments of war, (Jansenius) and would turn those metals to the purposes of agriculture. Others render the Hebrew, "Thy bars shall be of iron and brass, and thy reputation (strength, repose, or sorrow,) shall endure as long as thy life; or May they," &c., in the form of a wish. Moses desires that Aser may be secure against his enemies, as if he had a mind to insinuate, that this tribe would be led captive among the first by Teglathphalasar, 4 Kings xv. 29. Many of the cities of this tribe were strongly fortified. (Josephus) --- If we adopt <i>thy sorrow shall,</i> &c., we must observe, that the neighbourhood of Phœnicians exposed the people to continual incursions, (Calmet) and the king of Assyria at last came to complete their ruin.

      v:004:
        - 'DEU:34:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>This land,</i> which has been just described, is what God chiefly promised to the Patriarchs, comprising the countries on the east, as well as those on the western side of the Jordan. (Haydock) --- <i>To it.</i> But thou shalt be translated to a better land, the land of the living. Moses was now perfectly resigned to the will of God. (Salien) --- He no longer cherished those ardent desires of introducing the people into Chanaan, which he had not long before expressed: as he found that God had decreed that he should be deprived of the honour. He received this refusal as a just punishment of his transgression, and calmly reposed in the Lord. There seems no reason why Moses might not have written the preceding verses at least, though the names of some of the tribes are mentioned, who obtained possession only after his death. As he knew the limits of the promised land, so by the prophetic spirit, he might know that these tribes would be settled in the country; and he does not mark out their divisions with any degree of precision. In a word, there seems to be hardly a single passage in the Pentateuch, which may not have Moses for its author. (Haydock)'

(Challoner) --- Josephus ([Antiquities] iv. 9.), Philo, and Origen (contra Cels. ii. p. 95,) believe, however, that Moses wrote the account of his own death. See preface to Deuteronomy. (Haydock) --- <i>Moab,</i> which had formerly belonged to that nation. (Menochius) --- <i>Commandment.</i> Hebrew literally, "the mouth." The Rabbins say God kissed him, and thus released his soul. Some have nevertheless pretended that Moses was translated, like Elias, without dying. (Chaldean; Catharin; &c.) But his death and burial are too clearly mentioned in Scripture. St. Jerome (in Amos viii.) seems, at first view, to countenance the former opinion: but he only speaks of a spiritual translation, and not of the body. (Calmet) --- Josephus thinks that it was to prevent this mistake, that Moses wrote this chapter.'
      v:006:
        - 'DEU:34:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>He buried him,</i> viz., by the ministry of angels, and would have the place of his burial to be unknown, lest the Israelites, who were so prone to idolatry, might worship him with divine honours. (Challoner) --- St. Michael therefore contended with satan about his body, Jude 9. Some have maintained that Josue and Eleazar performed these last rites to their deceased lawgiver. (Calmet) --- But then some men would have known where he was buried. (Haydock) --- <i>Day.</i> It is pretended that Jeremias discovered the place, 2 Machabees ii. 4, 5. <i>He found</i> indeed <i>a hollow cave....and so stopped the door.</i> Yet this does not prove that he found the sepulchre of Moses, (Calmet) who was buried in some valley <i>over-against Phogor,</i> but it is not said in a cave. (Haydock) --- Cajetan infers from the body of Moses not being buried in the mountain, that it was conveyed by angels to some vale, where his attendants could not see him.'
      v:007:
        - 'DEU:34:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Eye.</i> Hebrew also, "colour." His sight and complexion were as good as in his youth, though he was 120 years old. --- <i>Moved.</i> The rays "of glory never changed," but attended him to the grave. (Chaldean) Hebrew, "his natural force (and vigour) never left him; <i>or</i> his cheeks did not fall in." (Calmet) --- The Roman Martyrology places the death of Moses on the 4th of September, though the Rabbins say he died in the 12th month. (Salien)'
      v:008:
        - 'DEU:34:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Days,</i> as they had done for Mary [Miriam] and for Aaron: (Josephus) the usual term was only seven days. (Calmet) --- The Jews would probably have prolonged their mourning for Moses forty days, in honour of the years of his government, if they had not been ordered to cross the Jordan. (Salien)'
      v:009:
        - DEU:34:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Because.</i> God was pleased to accompany this exterior sign with his blessing. (Haydock)
      v:010:
        - 'DEU:34:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Moses.</i> No prophet ever appeared with greater dignity, in the old law, than Moses. He behaved in all respects as the envoy of God, who has been pleased to give his character and eulogium, Numbers xii. 6., and Ecclesiasticus xlv. 1. His miracles were most astonishing, performed in the presence both of friends and of enemies, not for a short time, but for a continuance of many years. (Calmet) --- But when we compare Moses with the Messias, his person and law must be regarded indeed as illustrious figures, but infinitely beneath the reality. Moses was liable to failings, which caused him to be debarred from entering the land of promise; and he wore a veil, to shew that his law was only the shadow of a better, and that it could bring nothing to perfection. He works miracles in the name of the Lord, and with a rod: Jesus performs all <i>by</i> the word of <i>his</i> own <i>power,</i> (Hebrews i. 3,) as the sovereign of the world. But though Moses must sink in a comparison with Christ, yet no other personage sustained a more exalted character, or shone with greater splendour, as lawgiver, priest, prophet, ruler of a great and ungovernable people, and a sacred writer of the highest antiquity. Hence the Jews almost adore him. The Mahometans place him next to Jesus and their false prophet. (Haydock) --- The pagans have very probably ascribed many parts of his history to their idols, Bacchus, Mercury, and Typhon; and their greatest philosophers, Pythagoras, Plato, &c., have borrowed many things from his writings. "What, said Numenius, is Plato, but Moses in the Attic language?" See Exodus xxxiv. 29.; Clement of Alexandria, Strom. 1. and 5.; Josephus, contra Apion i.; Bochart, &c. (Calmet) --- In a word, St. Gregory of Nyssa, St. Ambrose, (de Cain 2,) and Philo, represent Moses as the most perfect example of a great and pious leader and legislator. (Salien, the year of the world 2583.) (Haydock)'

intro:
  - INTRODUCTION.
  - "This Book is called <b>Deuteronomy,</b> which signifies a <b>second law</b>, because it repeats and inculcates the ordinances formerly given on Mount Sinai, with other precepts not expressed before. The Hebrews, from the first words in the Book, call it <b>Elle Haddebarim</b>. (Challoner) --- It may be divided into many discourses, which Moses made to the people during the last two months of his life. (Haydock) --- The first was delivered by him on the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year, since the deliverance of the Hebrews out of Egypt, and relates various particulars which had occurred to them. In chap. iv. 41, and following, a supplement from the Book of Numbers is given to this discourse. Chap. v., a fresh exhortation to the people commences, which continues until chap. xxvii., where the famous blessings and maledictions, from the mountains of Garizim and Hebal, are related. In the following chapters, Moses exhorts the people, in the most pathetic manner, to be faithful to the Lord, adding the strongest threats and promises to enforce their compliance; and having appointed Josue to succeed him, and repeated that beautiful canticle which God ordered <i>them to write,</i> (chap. xxxi. 19,) he gives the Book of Deuteronomy, to be kept with care, (ver. 9,) blesses the tribes like a good and tender father, and gives up his soul to God on Mount Nebo, in the 120th year of his age. (Calmet) --- There can be no doubt but that Moses was the author of this book, as well as of the four preceding ones; though the last chapter may, perhaps, form a part of the Book of Josue, which formerly was written immediately after the works of Moses, without any such marks of distinction as we find at present. The whole Bible seemed to make but one verse. How easily, therefore, might the account of the death of Moses be taken in, as forming a part of the Pentateuch, when the different books came to be distinguished by separate titles! Such an insertion cannot hurt the general claim of Moses to be the author of the Pentateuch; or, if it should be thought to do so, no absolute proof can be brought to shew that he did not write this chapter also, by the spirit of prophecy. <i>All the people spoke to Esdras, the scribe, to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded, to Israel.</i> The whole nation of the Jews has all along maintained, that Moses wrote these books; and he himself repeatedly asserts, that he was ordered to leave on record many things of importance. Hence both internal and external evidence concur to establish his title to them; and if we be not disposed to cavil with all other authors, and to deny that Demosthenes, for example, Cæsar, and others, have written the works which bear their names, we must confess that the Pentateuch is to be attributed to the Jewish Legislator. Yet if this were a matter of doubt, the things contained in these books could not, on that account, be controverted. How many anonymous works have been published, which are of unquestionable authority! Many of the books of Scripture are of this nature. But as we have every reason to believe, that they have come down to us without any material corruption, and were written by people of veracity, by divine inspiration, they deserve to be regarded as authentic records. This is true, whether we speak of the originals or of the versions authorized by the Church; though it should suffice to stop the mouths of infidels, if we can procure an authentic history of the Bible by the collation of the different copies, which are extant. Thus, where the Hebrew editions appear to be incorrect, they may receive great light from the Samaritan copy of the Pentateuch, and from the versions of the Septuagint, and of other respectable authors on the whole Bible. The variations, which we may discover, are not of such moment, but that, if the very worst copy were selected, we should find the same great outlines of Scripture history, the same precepts of faith and morality. The laws of Moses, which are scattered through his five books, may be seen all together in their natural order, collected by Cornelius a Lapide and Calmet. But the spirit of God was pleased to intersperse historical facts among them, which both shew the occasion on which they were given, and enable us to read them with greater pleasure and satisfaction. The four preceding books might be compared to the four Gospels; Deuteronomy represents the whole, (Ven. Bede) and may be styled a Diatessaron, as it recalls to our mind the great Creator of all things, who was about to fulfil the promises which he had made to the Patriarchs. Almost all those to whom Moses addresses himself, had been unborn or very young, when their parents received God's commands at Sinai, and wandered in the desert. He therefore gives them an account of what had happened during the last eventful period of forty years. He shews what had brought on so many disasters, and cautions his hearers, that if they imitate the perfidy of their fathers, as he foresees, with sorrow, that they will, (chap. xxxi.) they must expect to be treated with no less severity. This prediction we behold verified, at the present day, in the persons of the scattered remnants of Israel. How sublime! how terrifying are the truths which Moses enforces with so much earnestness! The same threats which he denounces against the perfidious Jews, regard us in some measure. If we feel not their effects at present, in being driven out from our country, we have more reason to fear lest we should be excluded from our heavenly inheritance, if we do not repent. (Haydock)"
