        - '2CH:1:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Victims.</i> Hebrew, "holocausts," either with his own hand, or by the ministry of the priests. See 1 Kings xiii. 12. (Calmet)'
      v:007:

Neglecting the points of the Masorets, we may well understand Coa, a city of Egypt, or an island of the Mediterranean. The Masorets read <i>Mikve,</i> instead of Micoa. (Du Hamel)'

      v:009: '2CH:1:9 | 9 | 9 | Now, therefore, O Lord God, let thy word be fulfilled, which thou hast promised to David, my father: for thou hast made me king over thy great people, which is as innumerable as the dust of the earth.'
      v:010: '2CH:1:10 | 10 | 10 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may come in and go out before thy people: for who can worthily judge this thy people, which is so great?'

      v:012: '2CH:1:12 | 12 | 12 | Wisdom and knowledge are granted to thee: and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and glory, so that none of the kings before thee, nor after thee, shall be like thee.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '2CH:2:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Himself,</i> worthy of his great empire. He deemed that which David had built too mean, though that pious king had been ashamed to dwell in such a magnificent palace, while the ark of God was under skins, 2 Kings vii. 2. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - '2CH:2:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Numbered,</i> of the proselytes, ver. 17. (Tirinus) --- <i>Hew.</i> The stones were made ready for use, as well as the wood, before it was brought to the temple, 3 Kings vi. 7. --- <i>Six.</i> Only <i>three</i> are mentioned [in] 3 Kings v. 16. (Calmet) --- But three hundred overseers of higher order are here included. (Tirinus)'
      v:006:
        - "2CH:2:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Before him.</i> For this purpose do I design to build. (Menochius) --- Temples are more for our use than for God's, as none can be worthy of him. (Calmet)"
      v:007:
        - '2CH:2:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>Purple.</i> Hebrew <i>argevan,</i> (Haydock) a Chaldean word, of the same import as <i>argueman,</i> in Exodus. --- <i>Scarlet</i> and <i>blue</i> were also species of purple. The finest sort was found between Tyre and Carmel. See Vitruvius vii. 13.'
      v:008:
        - '2CH:2:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Pine.</i> Hebrew <i>algum,</i> which rather denotes a species of fir, than the juniper-tree; though the domestic kind was tall, and used in edifices. (Calmet) --- <i>Arceuthina,</i> "juniper," is taken from the Septuagint. (Du Hamel)'
      v:009:
        - '2CH:2:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Exceedingly.</i> Hebrew, "wonderfully great." (Haydock)'
      v:010:
        - '2CH:2:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Wheat.</i> Hebrew adds, "beaten." --- <i>Barley</i> and <i>wine</i> are not specified [in] 3 Kings v. 11. (Calmet) --- <i>Measures,</i> like the Roman amphora, contained 960 ozs. (Cornelius a Lapide) --- Hebrew has, "batim," in both places; but [in] 3 Kings we find, "twenty cores of oil." The <i>satum,</i> "measure," was only one-third of the bath or epha. (Calmet)'
      v:013:
        - "2CH:2:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Father.</i> Hebrew <i>Abi,</i> is considered by some as the surname of Hiram. (Pagnin, &c.) --- But he might have that title in consideration of his great skill, as Solomon gives it him, chap. iv. 16. We use master in the same sense. Septuagint have, \"servant,\" ({GREEK:START paida}παιδα{GREEK:END}) except the Roman edition, which agrees with the Hebrew and reads, {GREEK:START patera.}πατηρα.{GREEK:END} (Calmet) --- Protestants, \"of Huram, my father's;\" (Haydock) supply servant, or architect. (Tirinus)"
      v:014:
        - '2CH:2:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Dan,</i> the city, as the widow as of the tribe of Nephthali. (Du Hamel) --- <i>Whose.</i> Hebrew, "and his father," (Haydock) or "this Abi." (Calmet) See 3 Kings vii. 14. --- <i>Silk.</i> Hebrew, "byssus," which is the silk extracted from a fish, and not the fine linen of Egypt, or cotton which as sometimes this appellation, 1 Paralipomenon xv. 27. --- <i>My lord,</i> a term of civility.'
      v:016:
        - "2CH:2:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Floats.</i> So the Septuagint well express the Hebrew <i>raphsodoth,</i> which seems to be borrowed from the Greek <i>Rapsodia,</i> which denotes a collection of verses (Calmet) and was applied to Homer's poems, before they were collected. (Ælian xiii. 14.) <i>Joppe</i> was a port much used, (Calmet) though dangerous. (Josephus, Jewish Wars iii. 15.)"
      v:017:
        - "2CH:2:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Had made,</i> at the commencement of Solomon's reign, when David put such immense treasures into his hands. The second list was taken when the temple was begun. The <i>proselytes</i> were the remnants of the nations of the natives of Chanaan. The Jews foolishly pretend, (Calmet) that no strangers were allowed to embrace the law of Moses, under David and Solomon, for fear lest they might be influenced by self-interest rather than by the love of religion. (Seldon, Syn. iii. 2, 5.)"
      v:018:
        - '2CH:2:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Six.</i> We read <i>three,</i> 3 Kings v. 16.: people who where strangers, as the Israelites were not forced to work, chap. viii. 9. (Calmet)'

      v:002: '2CH:2:2 | 2 | 2 | And he numbered out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.'
      v:003: '2CH:2:3 | 3 | 3 | {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}He sent also to Hiram, king of Tyre, saying: As thou didst with David, my father, and didst send him cedars, to build him a house, in which he dwelt:'
      v:004: '2CH:2:4 | 4 | 4 | So do with me, that I may build a house to the name of the Lord, my God, to dedicate it to burn incense before him, and to perfume with aromatical spices, and for the continual setting forth of bread, and for the holocausts, morning and evening, and on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and the solemnities of the Lord, our God, for ever, which are commanded for Israel.'
      v:005: '2CH:2:5 | 5 | 5 | For the house which I desire to build, is great: for our God is great above all gods.'
      v:006: '2CH:2:6 | 6 | 6 | Who then can be able to build him a worthy house? if heaven, and the heavens of heavens cannot contain him: who am I, that I should be able to build him a house? but to this end only, that incense may be burnt before him.'
      v:007: '2CH:2:7 | 7 | 7 | Send me, therefore, a skilful man, that knoweth how to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, and in iron, in purple, in scarlet, and in blue, and that hath skill in engraving, with the artificers, which I have with me in Judea and Jerusalem, whom David, my father, provided.'
      v:008: '2CH:2:8 | 8 | 8 | Send me also cedars, and fir-trees, and pine-trees from Libanus: for I know that thy servants are skilful in cutting timber in Libanus, and my servants shall be with thy servants,'
      v:009: '2CH:2:9 | 9 | 9 | To provide me timber in abundance. For the house which I desire to build, is to be exceedingly great, and glorious.'
      v:010: '2CH:2:10 | 10 | 10 | And I will give thy servants, the workmen that are to cut down the trees, for their food twenty thousand cores of wheat, and as many cores of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, and twenty thousand measures of oil.'
      v:011: '2CH:2:11 | 11 | 11 | And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent a letter to Solomon, saying: Because the Lord hath loved his people, therefore he hath made thee king over them.'
      v:012: '2CH:2:12 | 12 | 12 | And he added, saying: Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who hath given to king David a wise and knowing son, endued with understanding and prudence, to build a house to the Lord, and a palace for himself.'
      v:013: '2CH:2:13 | 13 | 13 | I therefore have sent thee my father, Hiram, a wise and most skilful man,'
      v:014: '2CH:2:14 | 14 | 14 | The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, whose father was a Tyrian, who knoweth how to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, and in iron, and in marble, and in timber, in purple also, and violet, and silk, and scarlet: and who knoweth to grave all sort of graving, and to devise ingeniously all that there may be need of in the work with thy artificers, and with the artificers of my lord, David, thy father.'
      v:015: '2CH:2:15 | 15 | 15 | The wheat, therefore, and the barley, and the oil, and the wine, which thou, my lord, hast promised, send to thy servants.'
      v:016: '2CH:2:16 | 16 | 16 | And we will cut down as many trees out of Libanus, as thou shalt want, and will convey them in floats by sea to Joppe: and it will be thy part to bring them thence to Jerusalem.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '2CH:3:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Moria,</i> which signifies vision; (Calmet) the place pointed out to Abraham, (Genesis xxii. 2.; St. Augustine, de C.[City of God?] xvi. 32.) and to David, 1 Paralipomenon xxi. 15., and xxii. 1.'
      v:002:
        - '2CH:3:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Second.</i> Hebrew adds, (Du Hamel) "in the second <i>day</i> of the second month." (Protestants, &c.) (Haydock)'
      v:003:
        - '2CH:3:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>By the first,</i> or ancient <i>measure,</i> used before the captivity. The Babylonian cubit was a hand smaller, as Ezechiel (xl. 3.) intimates. (Calmet) --- Solomon used the same cubit as Moses, but doubled the proportions. (Menochius)'
      v:004:
        - '2CH:3:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>A hundred.</i> The Arabic and some copies of the Septuagint read only twenty. Capellus and Toinard would substitute, ten cubits. A small change in the Hebrew might occasion these variations. (Calmet) --- In 3 Kings vi. 2., we find the height was thirty cubits: but that might be only to the first floor. Many think that the temple was 120 cubits high: but Salien (the year of the world 3024) explains it of the four-square tower, (Menochius) in the front. (Calmet)'
      v:005:
        - '2CH:3:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>House,</i> between the most holy place and the porch, (Tirinus) or it may comprise all but the porch. Hebrew, "he covered (or boarded) all this great house." (Calmet) --- <i>Deal boards</i> interspersed with those of cedar, 3 Kings vi. 9. (Tirinus) --- <i>Fine,</i> (<i>obrizi.</i>) Hebrew, "of Parvaim, which is probably the same as Sepharvaim, Ophir, &c., not far from Media and Colchis. (Calmet)'
      v:008:
        - '2CH:3:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>Amounting to about,</i> is not in Hebrew. (Haydock)'
      v:009:
        - '2CH:3:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Sicles.</i> This weight seems enormous for each nail. Mariana supposes every nail weighed one sicle. But who will believe that only fifty were used? Hebrew, "And the weight of the nails was fifty," &c. The Syriac and Arabic omit this verse entirely. --- <i>Chambers,</i> or rather "the ceiling."'
      v:010:
        - '2CH:3:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Work.</i> Hebrew, "of the work of young men," or resembling them. (Munster) --- Septuagint, "the work of wood." Vulgate literally, "of sculpture work," (Haydock) as Le Clerc renders the original. Some moderns translate, "of a work like men in motion." (Mariana, Buxtorf) --- The cherubims were in an erect posture.'
      v:011:
        - '2CH:3:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Cubits,</i> comprising the breadth of their body. Each occupied ten cubits.'
      v:013:
        - '2CH:3:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>Toward.</i> Hebrew, "inward;" looking at each other, (Exodus xxv. 20.) or towards the altar of holocausts.'
      v:014:
        - '2CH:3:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>A veil.</i> Abulensis places it between the court and the holy: but Jansenius would have it before the holy of holies. It seems rather that there was a veil in both places, (Barad. t. ii. b. iii. 23.; Menochius) as Josephus ([Antiquities?] viii. 2., and xii. 10.) clearly intimates; and St. Paul speaks of the <i>second veil,</i> Hebrews ix. 3. It is not certain which of them was torn at the death of Jesus Christ, Matthew xxvii. 51. <i>Cherubims;</i> extraordinary figures. (Calmet)'
      v:015:
        - '2CH:3:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Five.</i> 3 Kings vii. 15., we read <i>each was eighteen cubits.</i> It is probable that each was 17½ and the other half was for the crown, (Calmet) or cornice. (Haydock)'
      v:016:
        - '2CH:3:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>In,</i> or "as in." (Sa) (Menochius) --- Protestants supply <i>as.</i> (Haydock) --- <i>Hundred,</i> for one row, or 200 for both, 3 Kings. (Du Hamel)'
      v:017:
        - '2CH:3:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Booz.</i> "Stability and strength" are derived from God alone. Thus Solomon designed to insinuate that God established the harmony of the universe. (Haydock) --- An orrery, or globe, was therefore placed on each of these pillars. (Parkhurst, in <i>con.</i>)'

      v:007: '2CH:3:7 | 7 | 7 | And the gold of the plates with which he overlaid the house, and the beams thereof, and the posts, and the walls, and the doors, was of the finest: and he graved cherubims on the walls.'

      v:010: '2CH:3:10 | 10 | 10 | He made also in the house of the holy of holies two cherubims of image-work: and he overlaid them with gold.'
      v:011: '2CH:3:11 | 11 | 11 | The wings of the cherubims were extended twenty cubits, so that one wing was five cubits long, and reached to the wall of the house: and the other was also five cubits long, and reached to the wing of the other cherub.'

    commentary:
      v:001:
        - '2CH:4:1 | 1 | 1 | <i>Altar</i> of holocausts, much larger than that of Moses. The one which was built after the captivity, was a square of fifteen cubits. This of Solomon was only ten in height. A sloping ascent was made up to it, according to Josephus; (Jewish Wars vi. 5., or v. 14.) or the steps were closed in, if we believe others. See Exodus xxvii. 1., and xx. 26. It is thought (Calmet) that the inside of the altar was filled with earth, (Menochius) or with rough stones: (Exodus xx. 24.; Du Hamel) but that is not certain, with regard to the brazen altar. See 1 Machabees iv. 44, 47. (Calmet)'
      v:002:
        - '2CH:4:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Sea,</i> or great brazen vessel, and some other things that were not in the tabernacle of Moses, whose plan was followed, but with greater magnificence. (Worthington)'
      v:003:
        - '2CH:4:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>Oxen.</i> In 3 Kings vii. 24., we read Hebrew, "knops," (Haydock) or "apples." --- <i>Of ten.</i> Hebrew, "ten in a cubit." Hence there must have been 600 heads of oxen, as the sea was thirty cubits in circumference, and there were two rows. (Calmet) --- Others suppose that there were only five in each row, or only one in each cubit. See Vatable and 3 Kings. The Septuagint and Syriac omit this verse. (Calmet) --- Yet it is found in the best editions of the Septuagint. (Haydock)'
      v:004:
        - '2CH:4:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Cast.</i> Hebrew adds, "when it (the sea) was cast." (Haydock) --- They were done at the same time, (Tirinus) and were perhaps intended to let out the water. The twelve oxen, which supported the sea, were not cast along with it. (Du Hamel)'
      v:005:
        - '2CH:4:5 | 5 | 5 | <i>Three.</i> 3 Kings <i>two,</i> may specify the usual quantity that was contained, though the vessel would absolutely hold a thousand measures, or baths, more. (Haydock)'
      v:006:
        - '2CH:4:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Holocaust,</i> as well as all the necessary utensils. --- <i>Priests.</i> They did not bathe in the sea, but drew water into other vessels. The Chaldean supposes that the work of Beseleel was for the high priest alone. (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - '2CH:4:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Hall,</i> (<i>basilicam.</i>) Septuagint use the same term ({GREEK:START aule}αυλη{GREEK:END}) as just before is rendered <i>court;</i> and the Protestants make no distinction, though the Hebrew terms be different. Septuagint render <i>chatsar,</i> "the court" of the people. There, we know, that Solomon had his tribune, chap. vi. 13. Ezechiel (xliii. 14.) distinguishes two; the great, lower or outward, (Calmet <i>chatsar</i>) or court, and that of the priests, (Haydock) which he styles the less, &c. The principal door lay to the east.'

(Calmet) --- The precise number is fixed at ninety-six for each row, Jeremias lii. 23. (Tirinus)'
      v:016:
        - '2CH:4:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>His father.</i> Hebrew <i>Abib,</i> which is considered by some as a surname, (Menochius) or the title may be given to Hiram, on account of his skill. (Calmet) --- He is so called by the king of Tyre, (chap. ii. 13.) for having instructed him in the true faith. (Worthington)'
      v:017:
        - '2CH:4:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>Saredatha,</i> or Sarthan, (3 Kings vii. 46.) not far from Bethsan, 3 Kings iv. 12. (Calmet)'
      v:021:
        - '2CH:4:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Flowers.</i> They represented lilies or other flowers (Tirinus) full-blown, when the lamps were burning. All the branches were of pure gold. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - '2CH:4:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Mortars,</i>to hold the fine flour. (Menochius) --- <i>And thus.</i> Here the fifth chapter commences, in Hebrew and Septuagint.'

      v:003:
        - "2CH:13:3 | 3 | 3 | <i>War.</i> The author of the new edition of St. Jerome mentions two manuscripts and there are several printed editions, which reduce these numbers to one half. Castalio adopts this correction, asserting that the Greek and Josephus are on his side, which is not true. (Calmet) --- We must however observe, that there is some doubt with respect to Josephus, (Haydock) as some of the oldest Latin editions acknowledge the smaller numbers; and Vignoles (i. 29.) conjectures, that the Greek copies did the same formerly, since Aborbanel \"accuses Josephus of having made Jeroboam's loss no more than 50,000, contrary to the Hebrew text,\" ver. 17. This learned author is of opinion, that the Jews sometimes expressed their numbers by figures, (Kennicott) analogous to those which the later Arabs borrowed from the Indians; though, in more ancient times, the letters of the alphabet had been used. Both customs seem to have prevailed; (Erpenius) and this may account for many variations, as the omission of a single cypher, resembling our period (.), might easily occasion much confusion. Kennicott (Diss. i., and ii.) seems to suspect, that the ancient versions have been made to agree with the corrupted Hebrew, no less than Josephus; and that many of the large numbers, recorded in Scripture, (which might countenance what we here read) are incorrect. See chap. xvii. 13, 19., and xiv. 8., comp.[compare] with xvi. 1., and xxv. 6., comp.[compare] with 4 Kings xiii. 7. It is certain (Haydock) many Latin manuscripts confirm the edition of Sixtus V, which has the smaller numbers; and this is the case with most of the older manuscripts and editions. How St. Jerome expressed it, we cannot easily determine. The editor of his works has been guided chiefly by the Memmian canon. See 2 Kings xv. 7. Lyranus quotes St. Jerome, as reading 50,000; (ver. 7) and it is so expressed in the Paris editions of 1534 and (Haydock) 1546, of the Hebrew questions on Paralipomenon. But Erasmus doubts whether this be the genuine work of St. Jerome, (Kennicott) or in the state in which he left it. If we consult the more ancient manuscripts and editions, prior to that of Clement VIII, we shall allow that they are more favourable to the smaller numbers, on this occasion; and are more likely to exhibit the pure version of the holy doctor, (Haydock) as the later editions have had \"the Hebrew fountains\" also in view. (Kennicott) --- If however we adhere to the received numbers, (Haydock) we must remember that kings, at that time, led forth to battle all their subjects who were able to bear arms. Under Moses there were 600,000. David found 1,100,000 in Israel, and 470,000 in Juda, exclusive of Levi and Benjamin; (chap. xxi. 5.) or, at least, as it is expressed [in] 2 Kings xxiv. 9., in all, 1,300,000. Asa was at the head of 580,000, chap. xiv. 8., &c."

The Arabs still regard the partaking of bread and salt as the most sacred covenant. (Calmet) --- "The ancients prayed when they placed salt before their guests, that, as salt partook of two natures, so they might be cemented together in concord." (Tzetzez on Lycoph.) (Haydock) --- Abia speaks with much prudence, and with an air of piety, though his heart was corrupt, 3 Kings xv. 3. That of his adversary was still more so; and God granted victory to the former, to reward even the appearance of virtue in the king, and the sincere piety of some of his followers.'

Joram was deprived of this honour, chap. xxi. 19.

He thus puts us in mind that no power can stand against God's will; and he endeavours, by humility, to obtain the protection of heaven. The invading army must, however, have been very numerous, to extort these expressions from a potent king, and to have thrown his whole people into such consternation. It could hardly be less than that of Zara; and thus, in the space of a century, above two millions and a half of idolaters perished by the hand of God, without Juda losing a single man, ver. 29., and chap. xiii. 17.

The Hebrews then shewed their resentment, without fear. The like custom prevailed in Egypt, and kept many within bounds. No person could receive the usual honours of burial, if his accusers could maintain their charge against his character before a court of above forty people, assembled for the purpose. Calumny was severely punished. But the kings themselves were to stand their trial, while their corpse was placed in the porch of the monument, and the priest spoke their funeral oration. The people testified their approbation or discontent, "and many of the kings have been deprived of a glorious and legal burial, on account of the opposition of the multitude." (Diodorus i. and ii.)

(Calmet) --- The contradiction has so much perplexed the commentators, that Walton (prol. 36) puts it among the <i>quædam <u>apora</u>;</i> and De Dieu says, \"I would rather plainly confess that this difficulty is to us inexplicable.\" The error here, \"is plainly owing to a mistake of one of the Hebrew numeral letters,\" <i>c,</i> being put instead of <i>m,</i> which was formerly more similar than it is now. \"In Origen's Hexapla, one of the Greek copies (probably that found in Caracalla's time) reads here <i>cb,</i> by rendering the number 22, {GREEK:START eikosi kai duo}ηικοσι και δυο{GREEK:END}, all which proofs make the mistake indubitable, and strongly recommend this method of correcting it.\" (Kennicott) --- Mariana, Tirinus, &c., had already suggested this plan, (Haydock) which is very plausible.

      v:014: '2CH:25:14 | 14 | 14 | But Amasias, after he had slain the Edomites, set up the gods of the children of Seir, which he had brought thence, to be his gods, and adored them, and burnt incense to them.'
      v:015: '2CH:25:15 | 15 | 15 | Wherefore the Lord being angry against Amasias, sent a prophet to him, to say to him: Why hast thou adored gods that have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?'
      v:016: "2CH:25:16 | 16 | 16 | And when he spoke these things, he answered him: Art thou the king's counsellor? be quiet, lest I kill thee. And the prophet departing, said: I know that God is minded to kill thee, because thou hast done this evil, and moreover hast not hearkened to my counsel."
      v:017: '2CH:25:17 | 17 | 17 | Then Amasias, king of Juda, taking very bad counsel, sent to Joas, the son of Joachaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: Come, let us see one another.'

      v:020: "2CH:25:20 | 20 | 20 | Amasias would not hearken to him, because it was the Lord's will that he should be delivered into the hands of enemies, because of the gods of Edom."
      v:021: '2CH:25:21 | 21 | 21 | So Joas, king of Israel, went up, and they presented themselves to be seen by one another: and Amasias, king of Juda, was in Bethsames of Juda:'
      v:022: '2CH:25:22 | 22 | 22 | And Juda fell before Israel, and they fled to their dwellings.'
      v:023: '2CH:25:23 | 23 | 23 | And Joas, king of Israel, took Amasias, king of Juda, the son of Joas, the son Joachaz, in Bethsames, and brought him to Jerusalem: and broke down the walls thereof from the gate of Ephraim, to the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits.'
      v:024: "2CH:25:24 | 24 | 24 | And he took all the gold, and silver, and all the vessels, that he found in the house of God, and with Obededom, and in the treasures of the king's house: moreover also the sons of the hostages, he brought back to Samaria."
      v:025: '2CH:25:25 | 25 | 25 | And Amasias, the son of Joas, king of Juda, lived, after the death of Joas, the son of Joachaz, king of Israel, fifteen years.'

      v:027: '2CH:25:27 | 27 | 27 | And after he revolted from the Lord, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. {VERSE_FOOTNOTE_INDEX_REF 0}And he fled into Lachis, and they sent, and killed him there.'

        - '2CH:30:2 | 2 | 2 | <i>Month.</i> The Rabbins pretend that the king intercalated the second Adar, contrary to the rule and advice of the wise, and the that he ought to have allowed those who were pure to celebrate the feast in due time. (Selden, Syn. ii. 1.) --- But the Caraite Jews deny this pretended leap-year; and we see that Ezechias acted according to the advice of the princes, and that the Scripture praises his conduct. (Calmet) --- Those who had a lawful impediment, were authorized to put off the feast till the second month, Numbers ix. 10. The nation was under this predicament, as they had not priests at hand, (Tirinus) nor were they assembled. (Du Hamel)'

(Grotius) --- Hebrew, "for they had not long <i>before</i> done according to the Scripture." Septuagint, "the multitude had not done," &c. (Calmet) --- Yet, even in the worst times, Tobias, (i. 6.) and other zealous souls, contrived to comply with their duty. (Haydock)'

But they were also invited, as well as the few who might remain on the other side [of] the Jordan, 1 Paralipomenon v. 26. At least, we find that some of <i>Aser came,</i> ver. 11. Thus those, who had been invited last, came first, while Ephraim continued more stubborn; (ver. 18) and the greatest part derided the messengers, as we still see too frequently verified in the days of the gospel. (Haydock)'
      v:011:
        - '2CH:30:11 | 11 | 11 | <i>Yielding.</i> Septuagint, "were converted." Protestants, "humbled themselves, and came." (Haydock)'

      v:014:
        - '2CH:30:14 | 14 | 14 | <i>Burnt,</i> both vessels and altars. (Calmet) --- <i>To idols,</i> corresponds with the Septuagint, "the false ones," and is added by way of explanation, unless it be lost in Hebrew. The illegal (Haydock) <i>altars</i> had been set up by Achaz, chap. xxviii. 24. (Menochius)'
      v:015:
        - '2CH:30:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>At length.</i> Septuagint, "were converted." Hebrew, "ashamed, and sanctified themselves." (Haydock) --- The ceremonies of purification for priests were longer, (chap. xxix. 34.) and the sacred ministers were ashamed to be outdone by the people. (Menochius)'
      v:016:
        - '2CH:30:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Levites,</i> who received the paschal lambs from the unsanctified. (Menochius) --- The law does not require the ministry of the tribe of Levi for this purpose, as each one might kill the paschal victim at home. But the people were not sufficiently purified on this occasion. (Lyranus) --- At other times, laics killed the victims, if they were clean, Exodus xii. 6. After the tabernacle was set up, the priests poured out the blood on the altar; and, in latter ages, they slew the victim according to Grotius. But the texts of Josephus ([Antiquities?] x. 5., and Jewish Wars vi. 45. Lat. vii. 17.; Haydock) are inconclusive; and Philo repeatedly asserts that, on one day, the law authorizes all the people to sacrifice: and, though he lived at Alexandria, his testimony respecting a fact of public notoriety, is not to be rejected. Only the unclean applied to the Levites on this occasion, and the latter had no more right to sacrifice than the rest. (Calmet)'
      v:017:
        - '2CH:30:17 | 17 | 17 | <i>For.</i> Protestants, "for every one <i>that was</i> not clean, to sanctify <i>them</i> unto the Lord." Septuagint, "not able to be purified to the Lord." (Haydock) --- The priests alone continued to pour the blood on the altar, till the destruction of the temple. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - '2CH:30:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Ephraim and....Issachar</i> had not been mentioned before, ver. 18. (Haydock) --- Some indulgence was shewn to the tribes of Israel, which had been so long rebellious, for fear lest they should return no more; and because they had shewn a good will in procuring the Levites to slay the victims for them, as that was rightly judged a more sacred action than to partake of the feast. The law forbade, nevertheless, the unclean to approach to any thing sacred, Leviticus xv. 31., and xxii. 4., and Numbers ix. 6. (Calmet) --- But a dispensation was granted, (Menochius) as the Passover could not be celebrated in any but the first or the second month. The people had come with such eagerness, that they had not time to acquire the purity required. (Calmet) --- They were however truly penitent, and God dispensed with them. (Worthington)'
      v:020:
        - '2CH:30:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Merciful;</i> literally, "appeased." Hebrew and Septuagint, "healed." St. Jerome (Trad.) says, "It was asserted that no unclean person could taste the Phase, but death presently ensued; and they understood that the Lord was appeased, because those who eat did not die." (Haydock) --- Hebrew <i>girpa</i> may, however, denote that God "pardoned," or did not impute the uncleanness to the people. (Schindler, and chap. xxxvi. 16., and Isaias vi. 10.)'
      v:021:
        - '2CH:30:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Days.</i> It seems all the observances had been omitted in the first month. The Jews teach, that those who have complied with those prescriptions, which require no particular purity, are not bound to keep the festival for seven days, nor to abstain from leavened bread the second month. --- <i>That agreed.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "of strength," sonorous, (Menochius) which they played on with all their force, or which sounded forth the divine power. (Calmet)'
      v:022:
        - '2CH:30:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>Heart;</i> encouraged them to bear the fatigue for other seven days. --- <i>Lord;</i> being of good dispositions, (Calmet) and able musicians. (Sa) (Menochius) --- <i>Praising.</i> Protestants, "making confession to." But the sense is the same. (Haydock) --- During the seven days, unleavened bread and peace-offerings were used, ver. 24. (Calmet)'
      v:023:
        - '2CH:30:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>Joy,</i> though not prescribed by the law. (Menochius) --- This we should call a work of supererogation, (Worthington) which gives Protestants so much offence. (Haydock)'

Septuagint, "in their places around." Syriac and Arabic, "in their public places." All the interpreters have read differently from what we find in Hebrew at present. Some may wonder that Josias should act thus, out of his own dominions. But the few Israelites who were left, had placed themselves under his protection; and as he made no ravages, and the Cuthites did not adopt the former superstitious practices of the country, they were not concerned to see the altars destroyed; nor were the kings of Assyria informed of, or interested to stop, these proceedings. (Calmet) --- Josias followed the directions of the priests and prophets; (Menochius) and many believe that the Assyrian monarch had given these territories to him, to hold, as his vassal; (Tirinus) or God restored them to the lawful king, (ver. 9) having promised all those countries to the family of David, for the express purpose of keeping up his own worship among his chosen people, and for exterminating idolatry.

(Haydock) --- The augurs of the latter might declare the truth, (Menochius) though they could not dive into futurity.

      v:004:
        - '2CH:36:4 | 4 | 4 | <i>Brother.</i> From the time of David, the son had always succeeded his father. (Worthington)'

        - '2CH:36:6 | 6 | 6 | <i>Babylon,</i> but sent him back soon after; (Tirinus) unless he altered his first design, (Du Hamel) and slew him disgracefully at Jerusalem. (Lyranus) (Estius) (Calmet) (4 Kings xxiii. 5.) --- He allowed him to reign as a vassal other three years, but took Daniel, &c., captives. The seventy years of Jeremias, (xxv. 11.) are to be dated from this event. (The year of the world 3402.) (Usher)'
      v:007:
        - '2CH:36:7 | 7 | 7 | <i>The vessels.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "a part of the vessels;" probably the <i>most precious,</i> (ver. 10) breaking the rest in pieces, as he left none behind, ver. 18. --- <i>Temple</i> of his God, Daniel i. 2.'
      v:008:
        - '2CH:36:8 | 8 | 8 | <i>In him.</i> The Jews explain this of the diabolical characters forbidden, Leviticus xix. 28. (Denis the Carthusian; R. Sal., &c.) --- But it may simply denote the hidden sins of the king, which God will bring to light, or his rebellious conduct. (Amama) (Genesis xliv. 16.) (Calmet)'
      v:009:
        - "2CH:36:9 | 9 | 9 | <i>Eight years old.</i> He was associated by his father to the kingdom, when he was but eight years old; but after his father's death, when he reigned alone, he was eighteen years old, 4 Kings xxiv. 8. (Challoner) --- He only enjoyed the throne three months and ten days. (Tirinus) --- We must however observe, (Haydock) that the Alexandrian Septuagint, the Syriac, and Arabic read here, eighteen. (Calmet) --- \"It is, in my opinion, a pity that the translators have not mended such apparent errata of the scribe of the present Hebrew out of 2 Kings xxiv. 8., or out of Septuagint, or out of common sense.\" (Wall) (Kennicott) --- These eight years may be dated from the captivity, and not from the king's birth. (Usher) (Du Hamel)"
      v:010:
        - '2CH:36:10 | 10 | 10 | <i>Year,</i> in spring, when kings go out to war. (Calmet) --- <i>Uncle.</i> Septuagint, "brother of his father," which comes to the same sense, and was certainly the case. Hebrew, "his brother."

        - '2CH:36:13 | 13 | 13 | <i>By God,</i> to be faithful. (Tirinus) --- This enhances his crime. (Calmet)'

        - '2CH:36:15 | 15 | 15 | <i>Early.</i> Protestants, "betimes, and sending: because," &c.

(Calmet)'
      v:016:
        - '2CH:36:16 | 16 | 16 | <i>Remedy.</i> All attempts to convert them proved in vain; (Tirinus) and God, perceiving that they even despised his calls, became inexorable. (Calmet)'
      v:018:
        - '2CH:36:18 | 18 | 18 | <i>Vessels.</i> Only a few remained, to be restored by Cyrus, ver. 19. (Calmet)'
      v:020:
        - '2CH:36:20 | 20 | 20 | <i>Sons;</i> Evilmerodac and Baltassar. --- <i>Persia;</i> Cyrus, who subdued the country.'
      v:021:
        - '2CH:36:21 | 21 | 21 | <i>Sabbaths,</i> every seventh year, Leviticus xxv. 2., and xxvi. 43., and Jeremias xxv. 11., and xxix. 10. --- <i>Expired:</i> not that the earth was quite neglected, all that time, from the third year of Joakim, the year of the world 3398 till 3468. (Calmet) --- But it was almost: particularly after the murder of Godolias, (Menochius) the public worship was at a stand, &c.

      v:022:
        - '2CH:36:22 | 22 | 22 | <i>First.</i> Cyrus had ruled over Persia from the year of the world 3444. He was now emperor of the East. (The year of the world 3468.) (Calmet) --- These two verses are repeated by Esdras, which evinces that he was the author of this work also, (Tirinus) adding them when he restored (Worthington) or revised (Haydock) the holy scriptures. (Worthington)'
      v:023:
        - '2CH:36:23 | 23 | 23 | <i>The Lord,</i> (<i>Jehova.</i>) In Esdras we find <i>yehi,</i> "Let," <i>his God.</i> (Haydock) --- <i>Up.</i> The sentence is completed in the following book, which makes it probable that these verses are here inserted improperly, by some transcriber. The book of Chronicles, though for many ages the last in the Hebrew manuscripts, was, perhaps, once followed by Ezra, as in Camb. Manuscript 1., (Kennicott) and as it is now in the Protestant version, taken from the Hebrew. (Haydock)'
