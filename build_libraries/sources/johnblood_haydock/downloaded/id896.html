                           The Roman Septuagint and Josephus place this war after the account of Naboth, chap. xxi. But the Alexandrian copy follows
                           the order of the Hebrew. (Haydock) --- They style <I>Benadad,</I> "the son of Ader." He succeeded (ver. 34.) the king who
                           attacked Baasa, chap. xv. 18. We know not the time nor the occasion of this war. (Calmet) --- Probably Achab had refused to
                           pay tribute, and God had a mind to try if his obstinacy would yield to kindness, ver. 13., and 28. (Salien, the year before

                           He had a desire to dispose of them, as he thought proper. Achab was willing to pay tribute, to remove the impending danger.

                           or subjects. The king of Israel has thus a plea to interest all his people, as the danger was common. (Salien) --- He assumes
                           the character of disinterestedness, as if he had been willing to abandon all his private property; knowing that Benadad would
                           not accede even to that hard proposal. (Haydock) --- Thus "Nero consulted the first men of the city, whether they would prefer
                           a doubtful war or a disgraceful peace." (Tacitus, An. xv.)</FONT></P><B>

                           for) my infantry;" (Haydock) as if his forces were so numerous as to cover the whole land, and leave no room for even foxes
                           to occupy. The hyperbole is equally great, supposing that his soldiers could by each taking a handful, or what might stick
                           to his feet, (Chaldean) carry off all Samaria. Josephus intimates, that Benadad speaks of erecting terraces of equal height
                           with the walls; others, that he would level the city with the ground, Ezechiel xxvi. 4. (Sanctius)</FONT></P><B>

                           having overcome his adversary. (Challoner) --- "Let not him who goes to battle, though well armed, boast; but the man who
                           returns victorious." (Chaldean) "Enough: let not the man with a crooked back boast, as one that is upright." (Septuagint)
                           "Let not him that girdeth, (Haydock) or is bound," (Hebrew) or rather "shutteth up, boast, as he that openeth." (Syriac) It
                           is easy to besiege: but the city does not always fall. Neither people in arms, nor the unarmed, have reason to boast; as the
                           former are often made prisoners, as soon as the latter. (Calmet) --- A despised enemy sometimes proves most dangerous. (Haydock)
                           --- Those who distrust in themselves, and place their confidence in God, prevail: a necessary lesson both in temporal and
                           spiritual warfare. (Worthington) --- The fortune of war is very doubtful. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           It does not appear who this and the other prophets were who address Achab so boldly during these wars; if indeed they were
                           different persons: Elias is never mentioned. Did Jezabel leave the rest alone? or did these wars break out before she began
                           to persecute them? (Calmet) --- Many suppose that the prophet, who spoke on this occasion, was Micheas. (Menochius) --- But

                           Literally, "footmen." (Haydock) --- Hebrew means either "sons or servants." The pages of honour, or the menial servants of
                           the lords, were not likely to gain the victory. (Calmet) --- There were 232 in number, ver. 15. Achab followed them, (ver.
                           19.) with 7000; and this army defeated the Syrians. --- <I>Thou,</I> not in person; but thy men must begin the attack.</FONT></P><B>

                           This he said out of contempt, and too great confidence; (Menochius) and this gave occasion to his defeat. For, while his men
                           were endeavouring to execute his orders punctually, the Israelites cut many in pieces, and routed the rest. (Salien)</FONT></P><B>

                           All the high places of Israel were covered with idols. Samaria, Bethel, Dan, &amp;c., were built on eminences. (Menochius)

                           at Garizim. The late miracle at Carmel was known to all. Hence the pagans, (Calmet) conformably to their notions of assigning
                           different parts of the creation to different gods, suspected that the god of Israel might preside only over the mountains.
                           (Haydock) --- People are always ready to blame any but themselves. (Calmet) --- They lay the fault on fortune, &amp;c. (Tirinus)

                           fire and earthquake have caused the city to sink; and a lake, nine miles in circumference, now occupies its place. The ruins
                           may still be discerned in its waters. It is about two hours walk from the plains of Balbec, (Paul Lucas. Levant i. 20.) at
                           the foot of Libanus. The waters must be very thick and bituminous, if what is related by the ancients be true; namely, that
                           the presents, offered to the Aphacite goddess, were tried by them, and deemed agreeable to her, if they sunk; as wool would

                                    <p>1 And *Benadad, king of Syria, gathered together all his host, and there were two and thirty kings with him, and horses,
                                    and chariots: and going up, he fought against Samaria, and besieged it.</p>
                                    <p>2 And sending messengers to Achab, king of Israel, into the city,</p>
                                    <p>3 He said: Thus saith Benadad: Thy silver and thy gold is mine: and thy wives and thy goodliest children are mine.</p>
                                    <p>4 And the king of Israel answered: According to thy word, my lord, O king, I am thine, and all that I have.</p>
                                    <p>5 And the messengers came again, and said: Thus saith Benadad, who sent us unto thee: Thy silver and thy gold, and thy
                                    wives and thy children, thou shalt deliver up to me.</p>
                                    <p>6 To-morrow, therefore, at this same hour, I will send my servants to thee, and they shall search thy house, and the houses
                                    of thy servants: and all that pleaseth them, they shall put in their hands, and take away.</p>
                                    <p>7 And the king of Israel called all the ancients of the land, and said: Mark, and see that he layeth snares for us. For
                                    he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver and gold: and I said not nay.</p>
                                    <p>8 And all the ancients, and all the people said to him: Hearken not to him, nor consent to him.</p>
                                    <p>9 Wherefore he answered the messengers of Benadad: Tell my lord, the king: All that thou didst send for to me, thy servant,
                                    at first, I will do: but this thing I cannot do.</p>
                                    <p>10 And the messengers returning brought him word. And he sent again, and said: Such and such things may the gods do to
                                    me, and more may they add, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.</p>
                                    <p>11 And the king of Israel answering, said: Tell him: Let not the girded boast himself as the ungirded.</p>
                                    <p>12 And it came to pass, when Benadad heard this word, that he and the kings were drinking in pavilions, and he said to
                                    his servants: Beset the city. And they beset it.</p>
                                    <p>13 And behold a prophet coming to Achab, king of Israel, said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Hast thou seen all this exceeding
                                    great multitude? behold I will deliver them into thy hand this day: that thou mayst know that I am the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>14 And Achab said: By whom? And he said to him: Thus saith the Lord: By the servants of the princes of the provinces. And
                                    he said: Who shall begin to fight? And he said: Thou.</p>
                                    <p>15 So he mustered the servants of the princes of the provinces, and he found the number of two hundred and thirty-two:
                                    and he mustered after them the people, all the children of Israel, seven thousand:</p>
                                    <p>16 And they went out at noon. But Benadad was drinking himself drunk in his pavilion, and the two and thirty kings with
                                    him, who were come to help him.</p>
                                    <p>17 And the servants of the princes of the provinces went out first. And Benadad sent. And they told him, saying: There
                                    are men come out of Samaria.</p>
                                    <p>18 And he said: Whether they come for peace, take them alive: or whether <i>they come</i> to fight, take them alive.</p>
                                    <p>19 So the servants of the princes of the provinces went out, and the rest of the army followed:</p>
                                    <p>20 And every one slew the man that came against him: and the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued after them. And Benadad,
                                    king of Syria, fled away on horseback with his horsemen.</p>
                                    <p>21 But the king of Israel going out overthrew the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.</p>
                                    <p>22 (And a prophet coming to the king of Israel, said to him: Go, and strengthen thyself, and know, and see what thou dost:
                                    for the next year the king of Syria will come up against thee.)</p>
                                    <p>23 But the servants of the king of Syria said to him: Their gods are gods of the hills, therefore they have overcome us:
                                    but it is better that we should fight against them in the plains, and we shall overcome them.</p>
                                    <p>24 Do thou, therefore, this thing: Remove all the kings from thy army, and put captains in their stead:</p>
                                    <p>25 And make up the number of soldiers that have been slain of thine, and horses, according to the former horses, and chariots,
                                    according to the chariots which thou hadst before: and we will fight against them in the plains, and thou shalt see that we
                                    shall overcome them. He believed their counsel, and did so.</p>
                                    <p>26 Wherefore, at the return of the year, *Benadad mustered the Syrians, and went up to Aphec, to fight against Israel.</p>
                                    <p>27 And the children of Israel were mustered, and taking victuals, went out on the other side, and encamped over-against
                                    them, like two little flocks of goats: but the Syrians filled the land.</p>
                                    <p>28 (And a man of God coming, said to the king of Israel: Thus saith the Lord: Because the Syrians have said: The Lord is
                                    God of the hills, but is not God of the valleys: I will deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and you shall know
                                    that I am the Lord.)</p>
                                    <p>29 And both sides set their armies in array one against the other seven days, and on the seventh day the battle was fought:
                                    and the children of Israel slew, of the Syrians, a hundred thousand footmen in one day.</p>
                                    <p>30 And they that remained fled to Aphec, into the city: and the wall fell upon seven and twenty thousand men, that were
                                    left. And Benadad, fleeing went into the city, into a chamber that was within a chamber.</p>
                                    <p>31 And his servants said to him: Behold, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful; so let us put
                                    sackcloths on our loins, and ropes on our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: perhaps he will save our lives.</p>
                                    <p>32 So they girded sackcloths on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said to
                                    him: Thy servant, Benadad, saith: I beseech thee let me have my life. And he said: If he be yet alive, he is my brother.</p>
                                    <p>33 The men took this for good luck: and in haste caught the word out of his mouth, and said: Thy brother Benadad. And he
                                    said to them: Go, and bring him to me. Then Benadad came out to him, and he lifted him up into his chariot.</p>
                                    <p>34 And he said to him: The cities which my father took from thy father, I will restore: and do thou make thee streets in
                                    Damascus, as my father made in Samaria, and having made a league, I will depart from thee. So he made a league with him, and
                                    let him go.</p>
                                    <p>35 Then a certain man of the sons of the prophets, said to his companion, in the word of the Lord: Strike me. But he would
                                    not strike.</p>
                                    <p>36 Then he said to him: Because thou wouldst not hearken to the word of the Lord, behold thou shalt depart from me, and
                                    a lion shall slay thee. And when he was gone a little from him, a lion found him, and slew him.</p>
                                    <p>37 Then he found another man, and said to him: Strike me. And he struck him and wounded him.</p>
                                    <p>38 So the prophet went, and met the king in the way, and disguised himself by sprinkling dust on his face and his eyes.</p>
                                    <p>39 And as the king passed by, he cried to the king, and said: Thy servant went out to fight hand to hand: and when a certain
                                    man was run away, one brought him to me, and said: Keep this man: and if he shall slip away, thy life shall be for his life,
                                    or thou shalt pay a talent of silver.</p>
                                    <p>40 And whilst I, in a hurry, turned this way and that, on a sudden he was not to be seen. And the king of Israel said to
                                    him: This is thy judgment, which thyself hast decreed.</p>
                                    <p>41 But he forthwith wiped off the dust from his face, and the king of Israel knew him, that he was one of the prophets.</p>
                                    <p>42 And he said to him: Thus saith the Lord: *Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man worthy of death, thy life shall
                                    be for his life, and thy people for his people.</p>
                                    <p>43 And the king of Israel returned to his house, slighting to hear, and raging came into Samaria.</p>
