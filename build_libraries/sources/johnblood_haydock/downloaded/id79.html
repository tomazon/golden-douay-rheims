                           (St. Ambrose) --- There is greater joy for the conversion of a sinner, than for the perseverance of the just; but it frequently
                           happens, that these being free from the chain of sin, remain indeed in the path of justice, but press not on eagerly to their
                           heavenly country; whilst such as have been sinners, are stung with grief at the remembrance of their former transgressions,
                           and calling to mind how they have forsaken their God, endeavour by present fervour to compensate for their past misconduct.
                           But it must be remembered that there are many just, whose lives cause such joy to the heavenly court, that all the penitential
                           exercises of sinners cannot be preferred before them. (St. Gregory, hom. xxxiv.)</FONT></P><B>

                           is very probable, from this verse, that the children of the family, when come to age, could demand of their parents the share

                           on what was customarily done. Grotius thinks this was the common law among the Ph&#339;nicians. --- The Gentiles, prefigured
                           by the prodigal son, received from their father, (the Almighty,) free-will, reason, mind, health, natural knowledge, and the
                           goods which are common to mankind, all which they dissipated and abused. Sinners who have besides received the gift of faith
                           and sanctification, by baptism, and who have profaned the holiness of their state, by crimes, are more express figures of

                           of the faithful Christians; and, therefore, he interprets the whole parable as applied to a disciple of Christ. But we should
                           recollect, that it is not uncommon for presumption to boast of what it never has done. The whole history of the Jews is full

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And the younger of them said to his father: Father, give me the portion

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And he went, and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country.

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father's

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 I will arise, and will go to my father, and say to him: Father, I
                                    have sinned against heaven, and before thee:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And rising up, he went to his father. And when he was yet a great
                                    way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and running to him, fell upon his neck and kissed him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And the son said to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and
                                    before thee: I am not now worthy to be called thy son.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 But the father said to his servants: Bring forth, quickly, the first

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and
                                    make merry:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 Because this, my son, was dead, and is come to life again: he was
                                    lost and is found. And they began to be merry.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 Now his elder son was in the field: and when he came and drew nigh
                                    to the house, he heard music and dancing:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And he said to him: Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed
                                    the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And he was angry, and would not go in. His father, therefore, coming
                                    out, began to entreat him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do
                                    I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my
                                    friends:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 But as soon as this, thy son, is come, who hath devoured his substance
                                    with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this, thy
                                    brother, was dead, and is come to life again: he was lost, and is found.</font></p>
