                           which you are to eat,</I> &amp;c. The prohibition of so many kinds of beasts, birds, and fishes, in the law, was ordered,
                           1. to exercise the people in obedience and temperance; 2. to restrain them from the vices of which these animals were symbols;
                           3. because the things here forbidden were for the most part unwholesome, and not proper to be eaten; 4. that the people of
                           God, by being obliged to abstain from things <I>corporally unclean,</I> might be trained up to seek a <I>spiritual cleanness.</I>
                           (Challoner) --- These animals had no natural uncleanness: for all <I>things are clean to the clean,</I> Titus i. 15. But they
                           were looked upon as such by the prejudice of the people, and many of them possessed noxious qualities. If they had been the
                           most excellent, the will of God is a sufficient reason to enforce the duty of abstinence; (Calmet) as it was in the case of
                           Adam and Eve. As some animals were adored, and others were deemed unclean by the Gentiles, the Hebrews were commanded to sacrifice
                           some of the former description, and to abhor also the latter, that they might never be so foolish, as to imitate the perversity
                           of the nations, in looking upon any animal as a god. (Theod., q. 11.) St. Thomas Aquinas (i. 2. q. 102. a. 6,) explains at
                           large, out of the holy fathers, the different vices, which the unclean animals represent. (Worthington) --- By the distinction
                           of these creatures, God would have his people known, chap. xx. 24, 26. Those who chose rather to die than to&nbsp;transgress
                           in this point, are justly honoured by the Church as martyrs, 2 Machabees vi. and vii. (St. Gregory, or. 20.) (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           unclean that had not fins and scales: that is, souls that did not raise themselves up by prayer, and cover themselves with
                           the scales of virtues, (Challoner) particularly of mortification and penance. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           This animal was abhorred by many other nations. If an Egyptian happened to touch one, he plunged into the Nile. (Herodotus
                           ii. 47.) Few are to be seen in the East. Yet the people of Crete and of Samos held swine in veneration; and they were offered
                           in sacrifice to Venus, by the Cyprians. They seem designed for slaughter, as they are good for nothing alive. They are very
                           subject to leprosy. (Calmet) --- The Jews would hardly name them, but called them "the beast." Old Eleazer was strongly instigated
                           to pretend at least to eat swine's flesh, but preferred a painful death before the transgression of God's law, 2 Machabees

                           The three former are species of the same kind. The <I>bruchus</I> is a young locust, without wings, (St. Augustine in Psal.
                           civ.,) and the <I>attachus</I> the least of all. (Pliny, xxix. 5.) The <I>ophiomachus</I> is large, "encounters serpents,"
                           and is destitute of wings. The nations called <I>Acridophagi,</I> received their name from their feeding upon locusts, which
                           are the food of the common people in Syria and Africa. See Pliny, xi. 29, &amp;c. Clenard, in 1541, wrote from Fez, that he
                           had seen the sky darkened with clouds of locusts, which the people endeavoured presently to destroy, and filled waggons with
                           their bodies, for food. Kirsten says, they are very delicious. Arnulph assures us, that they are a finger's breadth, and are
                           fried in oil by the poor. (Raban. in Matthew iii. 4.) See Joel ii. (Calmet) --- There is no need, therefore, of having recourse
                           to crab fish and wild pears, for John the Baptist's food, as Beza has done. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           nations, which did not adore animals, esteemed those unworthy of sacred things who had touched a carcass, though they invoked
