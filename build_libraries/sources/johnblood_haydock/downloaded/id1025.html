                           <i>Idox.</i> Greek, "ox," &amp;c. All the versions disagree, as the copyists have probably taken in part of ver. 3 too soon,
                           supposing that the genealogy of women was never given. St. Fulgentius (ep. ad Gallam) differs from all, giving the ancestors
                           of Manasses as the same with those of Judith. (Calmet) --- <i>Simeon, the son of Ruben.</i> In the Greek, it is, <i>the son
                           of Israel.</i> For Simeon, the patriarch, from whom Judith descended, was not the son, but the brother of Ruben. It seems
                           more probable, that the Simeon and the Ruben here mentioned are not the patriarchs, but two of the descendants of the patriarch
                           Simeon: and that the genealogy of Judith, recorded in this place, is not carried up so high as the patriarchs. No more than
                           that of Elcana, the father of Samuel, (1 Kings i. 1.) and that of king Saul, 1 Kings ix. 1. (Challoner) --- Others think that
                           Judith descended from Ruben, by her father, and from Simeon, by her mother; (Estius) or that, instead of <i>son</i> of Ruben,
                           we should read "brother." But as we know that Judith calls Simeon her father, (chap. ix. 2.) it is more likely that Ruben
                           has been placed for Israel, as it is in Syriac, St. Fulgentius, &amp;c. This correction is maintained by Bellarmine, Salien,
                           Menochius. (Calmet) --- Thus both Judith and her husband were of the same tribe, the former by Salathiel, the latter by Sarisadai.
                           (Calmet) --- Innumerable are the mistakes in the proper names, in Scripture. (Haydock) --- Some of these might have had more
                           than one. Greek has Sarasdai, (Complutensian, "Saladai;" Alexandrian Septuagint, "Salasadai.") instead of Simeon, son of Israel:
                           (Calmet) Alexandrian Septuagint, "<i>Jeel,</i>" which is probably a contraction for Israel. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           she might look towards Jerusalem, and pray with less distraction. Absalom lay in such a situation, 2 Kings xvi. 22. (Calmet)

                           and days of rejoicing of the house of Israel." (Haydock) --- Syriac and old Vulgate omit, "the day before the sabbath;" and
                           perhaps it may not have been in the original, the Greek translator having inserted it conformably to the practice of his times.
                           It was then prescribed to abstain from fasting, that the joy of the festival might not be impaired, (Grotius) and because
                           it would be necessary to taste what was made ready for the sabbath; (Skikard, Purim) or rather because, as the festival began
                           on Friday, between the two vespers, or from three to six in the afternoon, during the equinoxes, the fast could not be rigorously
                           observed on Friday. (Calmet) --- <i>New moons</i> were days of rejoicing. (Menochius) (1 Kings xx. 5.) --- The Jews kept two
                           days together, for fear of missing the day on which the moon really appeared. Several feasts were also prescribed perhaps
                           before this time, on the 1st and 22nd of Nisan, &amp;c.</font></p><b>

                           a miraculous interference of Providence. In other circumstances (Haydock) the magistrates would not have been to blame, though
                           Judith might think them so; (Serarius. See ver. 26.; Menochius) and, in effect, they ought rather to have died than thus to
