                           The valour and insolence of these men are placed together. Afterwards we have an account of the transactions of Gedeon in
                           the pursuit, ver. 4. (Haydock) --- The tribe of Ephraim seems to have had some grounds for being displeased at not being summoned
                           at first, as well as the tribes of Aser, &amp;c., which were farther off; particularly as they sprang from Joseph, no less
                           than Manasses, and had their portion in common. The general answers them with great respect, as otherwise their displeasure
                           might have had very pernicious consequences. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           termination, by killing the princes of the enemy. (Debrio adag. 157.) At the first siege of Troy, Telamon having entered the
                           city before Hercules, the latter was on the point of killing him, when Telamon, collecting a heap of stones, which he said
                           he intended for an altar in honour of "the victorious Hercules," the hero's fury was appeased. (Apol. Bibl. ii. 6.)</FONT></P><B>

                           Notwithstanding the precautions of Gedeon, some had got over the river, whom he resolves to follow at Bethsan. This city was
                           about 15 miles from Mount Thabor. His men had been in motion a great part of the night, and had not taken provisions (Calmet)

                           It would seem as if all these exploits had been performed between midnight and sun-rising, in the month of May, which is quite
                           incredible; and hence many translate, "the sun being up." Septuagint and Theodotion, "from the height <I>or</I> ascent of
                           Hares," (the situation of which we know not,) or "of the mountains," (Aquila) or "woods," (Symmachus) or perhaps "from the
                           eastward." (Calmet) --- The Scripture does not, however, specify that all this took place in the space of six or seven hours,
                           or of one night, but only that Gedeon came to Soccoth so early, as to take the magistrates unawares, being informed by a young
                           man where they lived. This might probably happen on the second morning, after he had surprised the camp of the Madianites,
                           at Jezrael. Protestants and Chaldean agree with the Vulgate, "before the sun was up." The other translations explain <I>chares,</I>
                           as if it denoted the place or situation from which Gedeon was returning. (Haydock) --- <I>Described.</I> The text may signify
                           either that the boy marked them out, or that Gedeon took down a memorandum of their names. (Calmet) --- He would not punish

                           Some of the relations or brothers of Gedeon had retired thither, as to a place of safety; and the latter wished to know what

                           2 Kings i. 15. (Calmet) --- Gedeon had a mind to make his son partake in the victory, and punish these kings for an unjust

                           They beg that they may die in a more speedy and noble manner. Tacitus (Hist. iv.) observes, "it was reported that Civilis

                           &amp;c. Men and women anciently wore on their necks or forehead ornaments of the same nature, as these camels did, Isaias
                           iii. 18. Latinus adorned his horses in the most splendid manner. Virgil, Æneid vii: <I>Aurea pectoribus demissa monilia pendent.</I>

                           who were in his army, and of whom he receives the <I>earlets</I> for his share of the spoil. (Calmet) --- But as those who
                           staid at home received a share of the booty, and no doubt would come to congratulate Gedeon on his victory, it seems equally
                           probable that this offer of the regal dignity was made to him in a full assembly of the people, (Haydock) which is greatly
                           to the honour of this valiant man. (Menochius) --- <I>Rule thou.</I> They wish to confer upon him a dignity which he did not
                           now possess, and which he absolutely refused, being, as he thought, incompatible with the theocracy. This shews that it was
                           not the dignity of judge, which he retained till his death, but that of king, which was so displeasing to God, when the Israelites
                           resolved to establish it among them, 1 Kings viii. 7. (Menochius; Tirinus; Grotius; Calmet) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] v.
                           8.) thinks that Gedeon wished to resign the former dignity, but was forced to retain it forty years. The judges were chosen
                           by God, and acted as his lieutenants, so that the people having no part in their election, the Lord alone was considered as
                           the king of Israel. Some are of opinion that the people wished, on this occasion, to make the dignity hereditary. (Calmet)
                           --- Serarius thinks that they made an offer of the regal power to Gedeon, to his son, and grandson, only. But it seems rather
                           that they meant to make the sovereign authority over entirely to his family, (Menochius) so great a sense had they of his
                           courage, moderation, and just severity, of which he had given such striking proofs. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           It was not then thought dishonourable to ask nor to receive presents. The most precious part of the booty had been already
                           presented to the general, according to the custom of the heroic times. But, as the people wished to make Gedeon king, he consents
                           to receive the earlets, as a memorial of their affection. --- <I>Earlets.</I> Hebrew and Septuagint (Menochius) may also signify,

                           under their noses; but, as men never did, it has not that meaning here, (Calmet) though there might be women in the camp of
                           the Madianites. (Haydock) --- <I>Ismaelites.</I> By this title various nations are designated. It seems almost as general

                           xxxii. 2., and xxxv. 12. The Persians, Africans, Lybians, &amp;c., wore ear-rings. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           it an instrument of their idolatrous worship, (Challoner) and perhaps consulting their idols with it. No law forbad the making
                           of such a garment. (Menochius) --- It was not peculiar to the high priest, since we find that Samuel and David occasionally
                           wore the ephod, (2 Kings vi. 14,) and probably Gedeon would, on public occasions, do the like with this most costly one, which
                           would serve to remind the people of the victory which they had gained over Madian. The chief judge in Egypt wore a great golden
                           chain and collar, adorned with curious figures, as a mark of his dignity. (Diod. ii. 3.) This monument of the victory, and
                           of the dignity of Gedeon, became, after his death, an occasion of superstition to the people, who foolishly imagined that
                           they might consult the Lord, wherever an ephod was found. See chap. xvii. 5., and Exodus xxv. 7. The began to neglect the
                           tabernacle, and to form a religion of their own choice. Many think that Gedeon was guilty of indiscretion in making it. (St.
                           Augustine, q. xli.; Lyranus; Estius) --- But the thing was in itself indifferent. He did not intend to arrogate to himself
                           the privileges of the Levitical tribe. The Scripture nowhere condemns him, but speaks of his faith and of his death with honour,
                           ver. 32., and Hebrews xi. 3. --- <I>With it.</I> Hebrew, "after it <I>or</I> him," which may either signify that this superstition
                           took place after the death of Gedeon, (Septuagint; Pagnin; Menochius) or in consequence of the making of the ephod. (Jonathan;

                           This is the most solid proof of Gedeon's piety, since he kept the people in awe, and faithful to the Lord during his life.
                           --- <I>God.</I> Hebrew, "and appointed Baal Berith their god," or goddess; for Berith, "of the covenant," is feminine. In
                           the temple of this idol, the citizens of Sichem kept money, chap ix. 4. The pagans had many gods who presided over treaties;
                           and the parties were, it seems, at liberty to choose whom they thought proper. They commonly pitched upon Jupiter, who is,
                           therefore, styled <I>Zeus orkios,</I> or <I>Dius fidius,</I> or <I>Fistius Jupiter.</I> (Laert. in Pythag.; Halicar. iv.)
                           A statue "of Jupiter for oaths," was seen at Olympus, holding the thunderbolts in his hands, ready to hurl against those who
                           proved faithless. (Pausan. Eliac.) Philo of Byblos speaks of the Ph&#339;nician god Eliun, "the High," and (Calmet) of the
                           goddess "Beruth," which last has a visible connection with Berith. The former title is sometimes given to the true God in
                           Scripture. The city of Berytus was so called, probably in honour of the latter. Nonnus seems to have styled her Beroe. (Bochart;
                           Chanaan ii. 17.) --- Pliny ([Natural History?] xxxi. 1.) mentions the god Briaze, at the foot of whose temple runs the river
                           Olachas, the waters of which are said to burn those who are guilty of perjury. The Chaldean reads, "they chose Beel-kiam for
                           their error." Amos (v. 26.) speaks of the images of <I>Chiun.</I> May he not be the same as Berith or Kiam? Spencer says,
                           that Chiun was Saturn: but Vossius thinks it was the moon. (Idol. ii. 23.) (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>
