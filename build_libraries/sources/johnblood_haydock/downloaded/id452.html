                           excluded from the camp of the Lord, and from that of the Levites, which occupied 2000 cubits round the tabernacle. But God
                           will not permit any of the camp to be defiled by such people. They were to absent themselves for seven days, and then wash
                           themselves, &amp;c., chap. xix. 11. If lepers be excluded from the camp, how much more do heretics deserve to be cast out

                           God. The Rabbins say, that when the person injured was already dead, the offender took 10 persons with him to the grave of

                           --- <I>The spirit of jealousy,</I> of fear, &amp;c., denotes those passions of the soul. This very remarkable law of Moses
                           suited the genius of his people, (Calmet) and tended greatly to restrain the infidelity of the married couple, and the fury
                           of suspicious husbands. (Theodoret, q. 10.) God was pleased, by a continual miracle, to manifest the truth, on this occasion,
                           provided the husband were not also guilty: for, in that case, the Rabbins assert, the waters had no effect. They relate many
                           particularities, which seem contrary to Philo and Josephus, who inform us that the trial was still made in their time, though
                           the former writers pretend that it was disused, on account of the many adulteries which were committed, in the age preceding
                           the destruction of the temple by Titus. They say that the person who had committed the crime with the woman, died at the same
                           time that the bitter waters put an end to her existence. When the suspected person was brought before the Sanhedrim, they
                           tried, by all means, to extort a confession from her. But if she persisted in maintaining her innocence, they made her stand
                           in black, before the eastern gate of the court, denouncing to her what she had to expect. If she answered <I>Amen,</I> the
                           priest wrote the imprecations (ver. 19-22,) on vellum, with ink, which had no mixture of vitriol in it; and taking water from
                           the laver, and dust from the court, with something bitter, like wormwood, effaced the writing in a new earthen vessel; while
                           another priest tore her garments as far as the breast, and tied them up with an <I>Egyptian</I> cord, to remind her of the
                           miracles wrought by God. If she confessed the crime before the writing was effaced, she was to be repudiated, without any
                           dowry; or, if she kept company with a suspected person, contrary to her husband's admonition, after she had come off victorious
                           from drinking the bitter waters, she was subjected to the same punishment, and could not demand to be admitted any more to
                           make the miraculous experiment. See Selden, Uxor. iii. 13.</FONT></P><B>

                           --- We do not read in Scripture that any was ever subjected to this trial. The method of giving a bill of divorce was more

                           To act in conformity with God's injunctions could not be reprehensible. But it would have been certainly criminal to tempt
                           God in this manner, in order to discover a secret offence, if he had not authorized it expressly. If the husband wished to
                           avoid the displeasure of God, he was bound to banish from his heart all malice, rash judgments, &amp;c. The permission here
                           granted, was owing to the hardness of heart of this stiff-necked people, as well as the laws regarding divorces and retaliation.
                           Women, being of a more fickle and suspicious temper, are not indulged with the privilege of divorcing their husbands, or of
                           making them drink the waters of jealousy. But if a man were taken in the act of adultery, he was put to death, Leviticus xx.
                           10. The crime is equal in both parties. "The husband, says Lactantius, (de V. Cultu. xxiii.) ought, by the regularity of his
                           conduct, to shew his wife what she owes him. For it is very unjust to exact from another, what you do not practise yourself.
                           This injustice is the cause of the disorders, into which married women sometimes fall. They are vexed at being obliged to
                           continue faithful to those, who will not be so to them." The Romans would not allow wives to bring an action against their
                           husbands. "You would kill, with impunity, your wife taken in adultery, without any trial, said Cato, and she would not dare
                           to touch you with her finger, if you fell into the same crime." (Gell. x. 23.) The authority which was given to husbands over
                           their wives, was deemed a sufficient restraint; and men being obliged to be often from home, and in company, would have been
                           exposed to continual alarms, from the suspicious temper of their wives, if they had been subjected to the like trials. (Calmet)
                           --- In latter ages, however, the Jewish ladies began to assume the right of divorcing their husbands, in imitation of Salome,
                           sister of Herod the great, and of Herodias, his grand-daughter, Matthew xiv. 3. (Josephus, Antiquities xv. 11 and xviii. 7.)
                           Grotius supposes that the Samaritan woman had divorced her five husbands, John iv. 18. But this being contrary to the law,
                           her first marriage alone subsisted. (Haydock) --- <I>Her iniquity,</I> in giving her husband any grounds of suspicion. The
                           Rabbins observe, that he was bound first to admonish her, before witnesses, not to keep company with people of bad character;
                           and if he could bring witnesses that she had been found afterwards with them for ever so short a time, he might have the remedy
                           of the law. The pagans maintained, that several of their fountains and rivers had the power of disclosing and punishing perjury.
                           Polemon mentions a fountain of this nature in Sicily; and Solinus (Chap. xi.) says, that one in Sardinia caused the perjured
                           to go blind. The waters of the Styx were greatly feared on this account. (Hesiod, Theog. 783.) Tatitus (vii. 20,) mentions
                           some other fountains, which had the same effects as the bitter waters. (Calmet) --- The various ordeal trials which were formerly
                           in use, were probably established in imitation of this law of Moses; but not having the same authority or sanction, they were
                           in danger of being looked upon as superstitious. (Haydock)</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2 face=Arial>
