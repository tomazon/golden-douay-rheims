                           the present Hebrew, which has, "Let them take five of the horses there remaining; behold they are like all the multitude of
                           Israel which is left; they are like all the multitude of Israel who are lost; let us send them." Arabic, "Let us send thither

                           they well be numbered with the other Israelites who are dead." Both horses and horsemen were dreadfully lean, and they could
                           not expect a better fate than those already consumed by famine. (Calmet) --- The truth of the report ought at least to be
                           fully ascertained. By following the timid advice of the king no prospect of redress appeared. At last the king consented to

                                    were come to the first part of the camp of the Syrians, they found no man there.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 For the Lord had made them hear, in the camp of Syria, the noise of
                                    chariots, and of horses, and of a very great army: and they said one to another: Behold, the king of Israel hath hired against
                                    us the kings of the Hethites, and of the Egyptians; and they are come upon us.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 Wherefore they arose, and fled away in the dark, and left their tents,
                                    and their horses and asses in the camp, and fled, desiring to save their lives.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 So when these lepers were come to the beginning of the camp, they went
                                    into one tent, and ate and drank: and they took from thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went, and hid it: and they
                                    came again, and went into another tent, and carried from thence in like manner, and hid it.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Then they said one to another: We do not well: for this is a day of
                                    good tidings. If we hold our peace, and do not tell it till the morning, we shall be charged with a crime: come, let us go,
                                    and tell it in the king's court.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 So they came to the gate of the city, and told them, saying: We went
                                    to the camp of the Syrians, and we found no man there, but horses, and asses tied, and the tents standing.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 Then the guards of the gate went, and told it within in the king's
                                    palace.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And he arose in the night, and said to his servants: I tell you what
                                    the Syrians have done to us: They know that we suffer great famine, and therefore they are gone out of the camp, and lie hid
                                    in the fields, saying: When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and then we may get into the city.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And one of his servants answered: Let us take the five horses that
                                    are remaining in the city (because there are no more in the whole multitude of Israel, for the rest are consumed), and let
                                    us send and see.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 They brought therefore two horses, and the king sent into the camp
                                    of the Syrians, saying: Go, and see.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And they went after them, as far as the Jordan: and behold, all the
                                    way was full of garments, and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away, in their fright, and the messengers returned, and
                                    told the king.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And the people going out, pillaged the camp of the Syrians: and a
                                    bushel of fine flour was sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, according to the word of the Lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And the king appointed that lord on whose hand he leaned, to stand
                                    at the gate: and the people trod upon him in the entrance of the gate; and he died, as the man of God had said, when the king
                                    came down to him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And it came to pass, according to the word of the man of God, which
                                    he spoke to the king, when he said: Two bushels of barley shall be for a stater, and a bushel of fine flour for a stater,
                                    at this very time to-morrow, in the gate of Samaria.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 When that lord answered the man of God, and said: Although the Lord
                                    should make flood-gates in heaven, could this come to pass which thou sayest? And he said to him: Thou shalt see it with thy
                                    eyes, and shalt not eat thereof.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And so it fell out to him, as it was foretold: and the people trod
                                    upon him in the gate, and he died.</font></p>
