                           agreeably to the law of Moses, Deuteronomy xx. 8. If God had not enforced this order, it would perhaps have been neglected
                           in the hurry, particularly as all seemed to have joined the army with such alacrity. (Menochius) --- Scipio going to destroy
                           Carthage, was informed that some Sicilian knights went on this expedition with extreme reluctance and fear; whereupon he gave
                           300 leave to depart. (Livy xxix.) --- <I>Galaad</I> perhaps may have been substituted for Gelboe, as there seems to have been
                           none from the Galaad, on the other side of the Jordan, in the army of Gedeon. (Calmet) --- Abulensis thinks that some little

                           Some Latin copies add, "and hand," as it is expressed in Hebrew, &amp;c., in the following verse. They resembled <I>dogs</I>
                           more in the hurry than in the method of taking water. An old proverb says, "the dog drinks and flees away," (Calmet) alluding
                           to the dogs of Egypt, who, through fear of the crocodiles which infest the banks of the Nile, lap the water with all expedition,
                           "like a dog from the Nile." (Erasmus; Haydock; Macrob. ii. 2.) --- Hence we might infer, that these 300 men were the most
                           cowardly in the army, as Josephus, ([Antiquities?] v. 8,) Theodoret, (q. 15,) have done; (Calmet) and thus the glory of the
                           victory would belong more incontrovertibly to God. (Haydock) --- But as these 300, on this supposition, ought to have been
                           disbanded, as well as the rest, we may rather conclude that they shewed greater courage and temperance by their posture, and
                           were therefore retained (Calmet) to accompany their heroic leader in his perilous expedition. We must, nevertheless remark,
                           that only those who preferred to acknowledge their fear, were disbanded according to the law; and as, among those who were
                           not quite so cowardly, (Haydock) there would be some less courageous than others, (Amama) these might be selected by God,

                           quite down to the waters to drink; which argued a more eager and sensual disposition. (Challoner) --- It is thought that the
                           former would be more capable of supporting the fatigues of war. (Menochius) --- The Jews suppose that those who knelt, had
                           been accustomed to do so in honour of Baal. Lyranus concludes that they were extremely fatigued and thirsty, while the 300
                           underwent the labours of war with less inconvenience. Josephus observes that this experiment was made in the heat of the day;
                           yet, if Providence had not interfered, it seems very improbable that 10,000 men should all be so eager for water. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Thus he confessed that he was not entirely free from <I>fear</I> himself, ver. 5, 10. (Haydock) --- The most courageous feel
                           less alarm, when they have a companion, (Menochius) as Diomede observed, when he desired that one or two might accompany him
                           in the attempt to explore the enemy's camp. (Homer, Iliad x.) --- <I>Arms.</I> The greatest part of this immense crowd of
                           people, who came to plunder, neglected the laws of war; as the Israelites had not dared, for a long time, to oppose them.
                           A select number of 135,000 men in arms was destined to keep them in order, and to protect them. Among these Gedeon insinuated
                           himself, to know how they were encamped, and what sentiments they entertained. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           cases, as we here see, God is pleased by dreams to foretel what he is about to do. (Challoner) --- See Genesis xl., Leviticus

                           had been no connection or reason in the discourse of the soldier, (which was not the case, as Providence put it into his mouth,)
                           the end would be equally obtained, which was to encourage Gedeon, and to inform him that the enemy was not without some apprehensions.
                           (Calmet) --- Gedeon was not of the richest family, but came with great expedition, as the rolling of the <I>barley-loaf</I>
                           might designate. (Menochius) --- He was also encamped upon an eminence, and presently threw the affairs of Madian into confusion.

                           or flambeaux, (Calmet) made of wood, full of turpentine. (Haydock) --- The soldiers held one end in their hand, and when they
                           had thrown down their pitchers, the sudden light, the sound of trumpets and of men on three sides of the camp, threw the various
                           nations into the utmost consternation, as they very naturally supposed that they were surrounded with a great army. God also
                           sent among them the spirit of confusion, so that they knew not one another. An ancient author, under the name of Tertullian,
                           asserts that the 300 men were on horseback, and conquered by virtue of the cross, as the letter T, in Greek, stands for 300;
                           (Calmet) and St. Augustine (q. 37,) follows up this idea, saying that, as the Greeks are put by the apostle for all the Gentiles,
                           this letter was to insinuate, that the Gentiles chiefly would believe in Christ. Some of the Fathers have given a like mysterious
                           explanation of the 318 servants of Abraham, as the two first letter of the name of Jesus denote 18. (Eucher. Gen. xiv. 14.)
                           (St. Ambrose, de Abr. i. 3.) --- We can never conquer our spiritual enemies, without a lively faith in our crucified Saviour.
                           If Amama, and other enemies of the cross of Christ, ridicule these pious meditations of the Fathers, we need not wonder. See
                           Apocalypse xiii. 18. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           This was the second of the three watches known to the ancient Hebrews: in the New Testament, they followed the Roman discipline,
                           and admitted four, Matthew xiv. 25. (Calmet) --- Menochius thinks they did the same at this time. (Haydock) --- <I>Alarmed.</I>
                           They were not asleep. (Menochius) --- We read of similar stratagems in the Roman history. The Falisci threw the Romans into
                           consternation, by appearing among them in mourning weeds; (Calmet) others read in priestly attire, (Haydock) with flambeaux
                           and serpents; as those of Veii did by means of burning torches. (Grotius; Fontin., Strat, ii. 4, &amp;c.) (Calmet) --- <I>Trumpets.</I>
                           In a mystical sense, the preachers of the gospel, in order to spiritual conquests, must not only sound with the trumpet of
                           the word of God, but must also break the earthen pitchers, by the mortification of the flesh and its passions, and carry lamps
                           in their hands by the light of their virtues. (Challoner) --- These lamps denote the virtues and miracles of the martyrs.
