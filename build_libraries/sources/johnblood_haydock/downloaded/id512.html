                           These were Hebron, Sichem, and Cades, on the west side of the Jordan, Josue xx. 7. Those on the east were already appointed,

                           Those who removed the latter were to be scourged for theft, and again for disobeying this law. (Selden, Jur. vi. 3.) Josephus
                           ([Antiquities?] iv. 8,) understands that encroachments on the territories of others, which give rise to many wars, are hereby
                           prohibited. (Calmet) --- So are likewise innovations in religion. The Romans had a superstitious veneration for these landmarks,
                           which they adored under the name of the god Terminus, (Haydock) crowning them with flowers, and offering cakes and sacrifices
                           to them. <I>Spargitur et c&#339;so communis Terminus agno.</I> (Ovid, Fast.) --- They punished the crime of removing them
                           either with death, banishment, or a fine.</FONT></P><B>

                           would suffice to make an enquiry into the affair, and to oblige the person accused, in pecuniary matters, to take an oath
                           that he owed nothing. (Maimonides) --- <I>Stand.</I> This expression was become proverbial, to denote the certainty of a thing,
                           Matthew xviii. 16., and 2 Corinthians xiii. 1. Two witnesses cannot so easily carry on a cheat, (Calmet) as was seen in the
                           case of Susanna. [Daniel xiii.] (Haydock) --- The law is satisfied with moral certainty. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           against the law, by apostacy or by idolatry, (Junius) or by any other grievous crime. The person accused might, in this case,
                           be examined, but he could not be condemned unless another witness appeared. Demosthenes (contra Aristocrat.) informs us how
                           (Calmet) the Athenians (Haydock) required the witness in criminal matters, to swear on the flesh of a wild boar, ram, and
                           bull, that he spoke the truth, and to utter horrible imprecations against himself and family, if he did otherwise. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           difficult questions, as well in those which regarded individuals, as in those which attacked the worship of God; since the
                           false accuser is to lose his life or limb, according as he had attempted to injure his neighbour; (ver. 21,) and the Lord

                           This is the design of penal laws, to render justice to the innocent, and to prevent the spreading of a contagious evil, by
                           cutting off the hopes of impunity. (Grotius, Jur. ii. 10. 9.) --- "I would cause the criminal's throat to be cut, says Seneca,
                           (de Ira ii.) with the same countenance and mind as I kill serpents and venomous animals."</FONT></P><B>

                           This regarded the judge, who must act with impartiality. (Worthington) --- The law admits of no mitigation, but inflicts the
                           same punishment on the calumniating witness, as he intended should fall upon his brother. (Lyranus; &amp;c.) --- Some Rabbins
                           (apud Fag.) pretend that this was executed with rigour, only when the innocent had sustained some real injury. See Exodus
                           xxi. 24. (Calmet)</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2 face=Arial>
