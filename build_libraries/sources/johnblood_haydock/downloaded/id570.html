                           This nation had formerly been almost extirpated by Moses, Numbers xxxi. 7, &amp;c. (Haydock) --- But they had re-established
                           themselves, and dwelt in the neighbourhood of the Moabites, whom they had assisted. They now made a league with Amalec, and
                           other eastern nations, (Calmet) in order to revenge themselves upon the Israelites. (Haydock) --- Madian was a descendant
                           of Abraham by Cetura, Genesis xxv. 2. The shortness of the servitude, which the Israelites had to suffer from them, was compensated
                           by its severity. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           (Calmet) --- It seems they had allowed Gedeon time to gather in some corn, (ver. 11.) and other Israelites would seize their
                           opportunity, and perhaps cut the corn before it was perfectly ripe, which the Vulgate may insinuate by mentioning <I>the blade.</I>

                           to make an exhortation to the people, assembled on some of the great festivals, (see chap. ii. 1.; Calmet) though he might
                           continue to exercise his authority afterwards. (Menochius) --- St. Augustine (q. 31,) thinks that the angel (ver. 11,) is

                           Michael. (Menochius) --- Some think it was the prophet who had addressed the people, or Phinees, according to the Rabbins.
                           See St. Augustine, q. 31. Others believe it was the Son of God, who takes the name of Jehovah. (Broughton and other Protestants)
                           --- But the most natural opinion is, that a real angel was sent, in the name of God, like that which appeared to Moses, and
                           assumed the incommunicable name, as the ambassador of God. Gedeon took him for a man, and presented him a noble feast, without
                           designing to offer sacrifice to him. Maimonides and Grotius seem to suppose that all this passed in a dream; but the sequal
                           refutes this opinion. --- <I>Ephra,</I> a city of the half tribe of Manasses, on the west side of the Jordan, of which Joas
                           was the richest citizen. He was of the family of Ezri, and a descendant of Abiezer, 1 Paralipomenon viii. 18. Hebrew might
                           be rendered, "Joas, the Abiezerite," chap. viii. 32., and xiii. 2. --- <I>Madian.</I> Not having the convenience of cleansing
                           the wheat in the open field, Gedeon was doing it privately, with a design to carry it off, at the approach of the enemy, and
                           to support himself and family in some cavern. Hebrew takes no notice of cleaning: "Gedeon threshed wheat, by the wine press,
                           to hide it, <I>or</I> to flee," &amp;c. He probably used a flail, or some smaller sticks, such as were employed to beat out
                           olives, Isaias xxviii. 27., and Ruth ii. 17. (Calmet) --- The wheat harvest was about Pentecost, that of barley was at Easter.
                           It seems the Madianites had been later than usual this year, in making their incursions, ver. 33. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           was not a priest, nor was there any altar prepared for a sacrifice. If Gedeon had intended to offer one, he would not have

                           Thus he would shew Gedeon that he had no need of food. He would exercise his obedience, and manifest a greater miracle, as
                           the flesh and bread would be less apt to take fire, when the angel touched them, even though some might imagine that he caused
                           a spark to come from the rock. For the like purpose, Elias ordered thrice four buckets of water to be poured on the bullock,
                           which fire from heaven would miraculously consume, 3 Kings xviii. 34. (Haydock) --- This broth might serve to anoint the altar,

                           bullock was designed for a peace-offering. (Bonfrere) Some infer that it had been fattened for Baal. Septuagint observe, that
                           the first bullock or "calf <I>was</I> fattened:" but it does not appear for what purpose. (Calmet) --- <I>Seven years,</I>

                           and Arabic) The Septuagint is favourable to this explanation. (Calmet) --- But the groves themselves were to be cut down,
                           where an altar of God was to be erected. It seems this altar and the grove belonged to Joas, who is hence supposed to have
                           joined in the worship of Baal. If he did formerly, his eyes were now opened, and he boldly approved of the conduct of his
                           son, (ver. 31.; Haydock) who had probably never been infected. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           Joas represents to the men of the city, who looked upon him with a degree of respect, (Haydock) as the first in power and
                           riches among them, (Calmet) how ill it became the Israelites to vindicate an idol. If Baal were truly so powerful, as they
                           seemed to imagine, (Haydock) and so eager to revenge himself, he could never be restrained from bringing his adversary to
                           condign punishment. "Let the gods punish those who injure them," said Tacitus, Ann. i. "They would take care that their sacred
                           things were not abused." (Livy x.) This argumentation would suit the idolaters, who supposed that their gods were animated
                           with the same sentiments and eagerness for revenge as themselves. But the true God, who can feel no such impressions, bears
                           for a long time with the impiety of men, though he requires that those who are in power should punish notorious offenders.
                           The magistrate is the instrument of God's justice, and must stop, as much as possible, the growth of vice and irreligion.
                           (Calmet) --- It seems the citizens of Ephra acquiesced to the reason or authority of Joas, and even enlisted under the banners

                           For the same reason, Esbaal and Meribaal are called Isboseth and Miphiboseth in Scripture. We read that Sanconiathon consulted
                           "Jerombaal, priest of the god Jao," concerning the antiquities of Ph&#339;nicia, which has led some to conclude that he had
                           seen Jerobaal. The work, however, of that author is generally supposed to be a fabrication of Porphyrius, and was unknown
                           to Josephus. It contains a multitude of fabulous accounts, intermixed with some truths, which might be taken from the Bible.
                           Gedeon was no priest, and we may suppose little concerned about the Ph&#339;nician affairs or antiquities. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 For they and all their flocks came with their tents, and like locusts
                                    filled all places, an innumerable multitude of men, and of camels, wasting whatsoever they touched.</font></p>

                                    the God of Israel: I made you to come up out of Egypt, and brought you out of the house of bondage,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And delivered you out of the hands of the Egyptians, and of all the
                                    enemies that afflicted you: and I cast them out at your coming in, and gave you their land.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And I said: I <i>am</i> the Lord your God, fear not the gods of the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And an angel of the Lord came, *and sat under an oak that was in Ephra,
                                    and belonged to Joas, the father of the family of Ezri. And when Gedeon, his son, was threshing and cleansing wheat by the
                                    wine-press, to flee from Madian,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 The angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said: The Lord is with

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And Gedeon said to him: I beseech thee, my lord, if the Lord be with
                                    us, why have these evils fallen upon us? Where are his miracles, which our fathers have told us of, saying: The Lord brought
                                    us out of Egypt? but now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hand of Madian.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And the Lord looked upon him, and said: *Go, in this thy strength,
                                    and thou shalt deliver Israel out of the hand of Madian: know that I have sent thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 He answered, and said: I beseech thee, my lord, wherewith shall I
                                    deliver Israel? Behold, my family is the meanest in Manasses, and I am the least in my father's house.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And the Lord said to him: I will be with thee: and thou shalt cut
                                    off Madian as one man.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And he said: If I have found grace before thee, give me a sign that

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And depart not hence, till I return to thee, and bring a sacrifice,
                                    and offer it to thee. And he answered: I will wait thy coming.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 So Gedeon went in, and boiled a kid, and made unleavened loaves of
                                    a measure of flour: and putting the flesh in a basket, and the broth of the flesh into a pot, he carried all under the oak,
                                    and presented to him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And the angel of the Lord said to him: Take the flesh and the unleavened

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 The angel of the Lord put forth the tip of the rod, which he held
                                    in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened loaves: and there arose a fire from the rock, and consumed the flesh
                                    and the unleavened loaves: and the angel of the Lord vanished out of his sight.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And Gedeon seeing that it was the angel of the Lord, said: Alas, my

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And the Lord said to him: Peace be with thee: fear not, thou shalt

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And Gedeon built there an altar to the Lord, and called it the Lord's
                                    peace, until this present day. And when he was yet in Ephra, which is of the family of Ezri,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 That night the Lord said to him: Take a bullock of thy father's, and
                                    another bullock of seven years, and thou shalt destroy the altar of Baal, which is thy father's: and cut down the grove that
                                    is about the altar:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And thou shalt build an altar to the Lord thy God, in the top of this
                                    rock, whereupon thou didst lay the sacrifice before: and thou shalt take the second bullock, and shalt offer a holocaust upon
                                    a pile of the wood, which thou shalt cut down out of the grove.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 Then Gedeon, taking ten men of his servants, did as the Lord had commanded
                                    him. But fearing his father's house, and the men of that city, he would not do it by day, but did all by night.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And when the men of that town were risen in the morning, they saw
                                    the altar of Baal destroyed, and the grove cut down, and the second bullock laid upon the altar, which then was built.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And they said one to another: Who hath done this? And when they enquired
                                    for the author of the fact, it was said: Gedeon, the son of Joas, did all this.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And they said to Joas: Bring out thy son hither, that he may die:
                                    because he hath destroyed the altar of Baal, and hath cut down his grove.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 He answered them: Are you the avengers of Baal, that you fight for
                                    him? he that is his adversary, let him die before to-morrow light appear: if he be a god, let him revenge himself on him that
                                    hath cast down his altar.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 From that day Gedeon was called Jerobaal, because Joas had said: Let
                                    Baal revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 Now all Madian, and Amalec, and the eastern people, were gathered
                                    together, and passing over the Jordan, camped in the valley of Jezrael.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 But the spirit of the Lord came upon Gedeon, and he sounded the trumpet,
                                    and called together the house of Abiezer, to follow him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And he sent messengers into all Manasses, and they also followed him:
                                    and other messengers into Aser, and Zabulon, and Nephthali, and they came to meet him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And Gedeon said to God: If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou
                                    hast said,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 I will put this fleece of wool on the floor: if there be dew in the
                                    fleece only, and it be dry on all the ground beside, I shall know that by my hand, as thou hast said, thou wilt deliver Israel.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 And it was so. And rising before day, wringing the fleece, he filled
                                    a vessel with the dew.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 And he said again to God: Let not thy wrath be kindled against me,
                                    if I try once more, seeking a sign in the fleece. I pray that the fleece only may be dry, and all the ground wet with dew.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 And God did that night as he had requested: and it was dry on the
