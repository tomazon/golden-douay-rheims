                           others in Mount Seir. (1 Paralipomenon iv. 39; Josue xi. 2.) Simeon alone was not blessed by Moses, Deuteronomy xxxiii. (Du

                           and principally that the sceptre, and legislative power, should not be utterly taken away from his race till about the time
                           of the coming of Christ: as in effect it never was: which is a demonstration against the modern Jews, that the Messias is
                           long since come; for the sceptre has long since been utterly taken away from Juda. (Challoner) --- This none can deny. Juda
                           is compared to <i>a lion,</i> which was the emblem of his royal dignity, and was borne in the standards of that tribe. ---

                           <i>The sceptre.</i> Almost every word in this verse has been explained in a different manner. But all the ancient Jews agree
                           with Christians, that it contains a prediction of the Messias, and points out the period of his coming. Whether this was verified
                           when Herod, a foreigner, got possession of the throne, and was acknowledged by the Jews, just about the time of our Saviour's
                           nativity, as most of the fathers suppose; or it only took its full effect when Agrippa II lost all his power, the temple and
                           the city were laid in ruins, and the whole nation dispersed for ever, it is not perhaps so easy to determine. In either supposition,
                           the Messias has long since come. Jacob foretels, either that Christ would make his appearance as soon as the Jews should fall
                           under a foreign yoke, and in this sense he was born about the 37th year of Herod the great --- or he should come just before
                           the kingdom of Juda should have an end, which took place in the 70th year of the Christian era, or about 37 years after the
                           public appearance and death of our Saviour. <i>The sceptre shall not depart</i> irrevocably from the Jews; over whom the tribe
                           of Juda had always the greatest authority in appointing the princes, when they were not selected from the tribe itself, or
                           <i>from his thigh; till the Messias,</i> who has been expected so long, shall come and gather <i>all nations</i> into his
                           Church. Then the designs of Providence, in watching over the Jews, being accomplished, their republic shall be dissolved,
                           because they have shed his <i>blood,</i> instead of acknowledging his celestial beauty, ver. 12. The evident signs of decay
                           in the kingdom of the Jews, were sufficient to excite the attention of all to look for the Messias; and we read, both in St.
                           John iv. 25, in Tacitus, and Suetorius, that his appearance was fully expected about that time. The <i>sceptre</i> is the
                           emblem of sovereign, though not always independent, power. Juda and his posterity were always at the head of their brethren.
                           They marched first in the wilderness; two of the judges were of this tribe. But their chief glory began with David, whose
                           posterity the whole nation obeyed, till Jeroboam tore away the ten tribes. Still the tribe of Benjamin and the Levites adhered
                           to Juda. During the captivity, there were judges admitted to superintend over their brethren; and King Joakim was raised to
                           high authority. The rulers who came into power after the return of the Jews, were either of this tribe, at least by the mother's
                           side, or were chosen and recognized by the tribe of Juda. Even Herod, in this sense, might be considered as a Jewish king,
                           though a foreigner, as well as a Thracian might be counted a Roman emperor, without any diminution of the imperial authority
                           of Rome. Perhaps indeed he was an usurper, till the nation acknowledged his authority two years after the birth of Christ.
                           (Philo, de Temp. ii; Josephus, Antiquities xvii. 3.) "Herod was the first foreign king admitted by the Jews." (St. Augustine,
                           City of God xviii. 45.) If, therefore, no stranger was to be acknowledged by the nation, till He came, who was to establish
                           a spiritual and everlasting kingdom, the moment was arrived, when the Jews submitted to Herod, and Christ had actually been
                           born two years. --- <i>From Juda,</i> or from that tribe; for Jacob gave peculiar blessings to each; (ver. 28,) and hence
                           the fathers gather, that the Messias should spring from Juda. --- <i>Ruler from his thigh,</i> lineally descended from him,
                           or acknowledged at least by his posterity, as all the legal princes were till the coming of Christ. --- <i>Mechokek</i> might
                           also signify a teacher or scribe expounding the law of Moses, which subsisted for the same period; but this is more probably
                           a farther explication of the <i>sceptre,</i> &amp;c. (Calmet) --- <i>Till had ci,</i> which words being joined together, are
                           always taken in this sense. (Helvicus.) --- <i>Sent. Schiloach</i> (or <font size="3"><em>Ssolu</em></font><font face="Times

                           we now read <i>Shiloh</i> (or <i>Ssole</i>) "to whom" the authority belongs; Septuagint, "to whom all things are reserved;
                           <i>or</i> till the things arrive, which are laid up for him. (Calmet) --- <i>Expectation,</i> or congregation of <i>nations,</i>
