                           therefore he retired. He could indeed have remained amongst them in security, had he chosen to exercise his power; but he

                           Jesus was not yet glorified? To this we answer: that the Holy Ghost was given, though not in that manifest manner as after
                           the ascension; for as Christ, as man, had always the Holy Ghost residing within him, and yet after his baptism received the

                           different worship of the Jews and of the Samaritans. (Witham) --- Sichem was at the foot of Mount Garizim. The Samaritans
                           supposed the patriarchs had exercised their religious acts on this mountain. (Bible de Vence) --- Josephus (Antiquities, lib.
                           xiii. chap. 6.) gives the dispute between the Jews and the Samaritans. Both parties referred themselves to the arbitration
                           of king Ptolemy Philometer, who gave judgment in favour of the Jews, upon their stating the antiquity of their temple, and
                           the uninterrupted succession of the priesthood, officiating there throughout all ages. In this controversy, the intelligent
                           reader will see some resemblance to that which subsists between Catholics and Protestants. See Dr. Kellison's Survey of the
                           New Religion, p. 129. --- The woman in this place must mean <I>offering sacrifice,</I> for <I>adoration </I>was never limited
                           to any particular place. It is clear from 3 Kings ix. 3. from 2 Paralipomenon vii. 12. that God had chosen the temple of Jerusalem;
                           but the Samaritans rejected all the books of Scripture, except the Pentateuch of Moses. The schism was begun by Manasses,
                           a fugitive priest, that he might hold his unlawful wife thereby, and obtain superiority in schism; which he could not do whilst
                           he remained in the unity of his brethren. How forcibly do these circumstances remind us of a much later promoter of schism,
                           king Henry VIII. It is true the Protestants appeal to the primitive Christians, as the Samaritans appealed to the patriarchs,
                           but in the argument both must stand or fall by the incontrovertible proof of continual succession.</FONT></P><B>

                           Israelites, on account of their innumerable sins, had been delivered by the Almighty into the hands of the king of Assyria,
                           who led them all away captives into Babylon and Medea, and sent other nations whom he had collected from different parts,
                           to inhabit Samaria. But the Almighty, to shew to all nations that he had not delivered up these his people for want of power
                           to defend, but solely on account of their transgressions, sent lions into the land to persecute these strangers. The Assyrian
                           king upon hearing this, sent them a priest to teach them the law of God; but neither after this did they depart wholly from
                           their impiety, but in part only: for many of them returned again to their idols, worshipping at the same time the true God.
                           It was on this account that Christ preferred the Jews before them, saying, <I>that salvation is of the Jews,</I> with whom
                           it was the chief principle to acknowledge the true God, and hold every denomination of idols in detestation; whereas, the
                           Samaritans by mixing the worship of the one with the other, plainly shewed that they held the God of the universe in no greater

                           now practise. Such adorers God himself (who is a pure spirit) desires, which they shall be taught by the Messias. (Witham)
                           --- Our Lord foretells her that sacrifices in both these temples should shortly cease, giving her these three instructions:
                           1. That the true sacrifice should be limited no longer to one spot or nation, but should be offered throughout all nations,
                           according to that of Malachias; (i. 11.) 2. That the gross and carnal adoration by the flesh and blood of beasts, not having
                           in them grace, spirit, and life, should be taken away, and another sacrifice succeed, which should be in itself invisible,
                           divine, and full of life, spirit, and grace; 3. That this sacrifice should be truth itself, whereof all former sacrifices
                           were but shadows and figures. He calleth here spirit and truth that which, in the first chapter, (ver. 17) is called grace
                           and truth. Now this is no more than a prophecy and description of the sacrifice of the faithful Gentiles in the body and blood
                           of Christ; for all the adoration of the Catholic Church is properly spiritual, though certain external objects be joined thereto,
                           on account of the state of our nature, which requireth it. Be careful then not to gather from Christ's words that Christian
                           men should have no use of external signs and offices towards God; for that would take away all sacrifice, sacraments, prayers,
                           churches and societies. &amp;c. &amp;c. (Bristow)</FONT></P><B>

                           is said, Jesus <I>went into Galilee</I> and <I>gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</I> One would
                           think this should not be a reason for his going into Galilee, but rather why he should not go thither. St. Cyril,[1] and also
                           St. Chrysostom distinguish different parts of Galilee; and say that when Jesus <I>went into Galilee,</I> the meaning is, that
                           he would not at that time go <I>to Nazareth,</I> where he was bred, nor <I>to Capharnaum,</I> where he had lived for a time,
                           but went <I>to Cana,</I> and those <I>other parts</I> of Galilee; and that the word <I>for</I> only gives the reason of this,
                           that he would not go to Nazareth or Capharnaum, because no prophet is honoured in his own country. And for the same reason
                           he again said to the <I>ruler:</I> (ver. 48) <I>Unless you see signs and wonders you believe not:</I> whereas the Samaritans,
