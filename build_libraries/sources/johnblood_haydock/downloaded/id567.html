                           (Haydock) --- Too long a peace has proved sometimes fatal to states and to the virtue of individuals. In adversity we call
                           upon God, and adhere to him with greater fervour and constancy. The Jews were so prone to evil, that, if they were permitted
                           to enjoy tranquility for a few years, they presently forgot themselves and the author of all their good, and even turned their
                           backs upon the only true God. Their enemies forced them to have recourse to Him. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           to have been take by Juda, (chap. i. 18,) unless the Septuagint be more accurate, as this passage would seem to insinuate.

                           Various reasons are assigned, on the part of God, for not exterminating these nations at once. But their being spared so long,
                           must be imputed to the disobedience of the Israelites, otherwise they would surely never have been tolerated with their idol-worship
                           in the land of promise, to contaminate, by their wicked example, the manners of God's people. If they would have redeemed
                           their lives, they must at least have given up the land and their idols. As the Israelites proved so little zealous in destroying
                           the latter, they were justly punished by God, in being deprived of what would have contributed to make them richer and more
                           comfortable in this world. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           "forty years after Josue, according to the chronology of Usher, which we follow," (Calmet) or rather Usher translates the
                           land began to rest "in the fortieth year" from the peace of Josue. He places the death to that leader in the year of the world
                           2570, and the end of Chusan's dominion 2599; so that, if we deduct 40 years from this last date, we shall come to the year
                           2559, the sixth of Josue's administration, when he began to divide the conquered lands. He supposes that the peace of Othoniel
                           lasted about 62 years, when Eglon disturbed it for <I>eighteen years.</I> "Aod delivered Israel. After him Samgar appeared,
                           and the land rested till the 80<I>th</I> year from the peace of Othoniel." Houbigant censures this indiscriminate use of cardinal
                           and of ordinal numbers, and the blending the times of servitude with those of peace; (Haydock) and "surely this method of
                           reckoning is very harsh, and contrary to the usual acceptation of words." (Calmet) --- Yet it is adopted by many. (Worthington)
                           --- It may suit to form a system, but can have no solid foundation. (Haydock) --- The epoch from which Usher dates is no where
                           so distinctly specified, as that we should suppose that the author of the Book of Judges had it in view. Moreover, by this
                           method, we are left to guess how long each of the judges reigned, or how long the peace which they had procured, subsisted.
                           Usher admits that the years of servitude are specified; and, why not also the years of peace, since they are expressed exactly
                           in the same manner? If the ordinal numbers 40th, 80th, &amp;c., were intended, <I>b</I> would be prefixed, as [in] Deuteronomy
                           i. 3.; and this grammatical observation alone, suffices to overturn the calculation of Usher. (Houbigant, Proleg.) --- Salien
                           dates from the death of Josue in 2600, and allows that 40 years elapsed from that period till the decease of Othoniel; including
                           the years which some attribute to the ancients, and to the anarchy; (chap. xvii., &amp;c., to the end,) and also the eight
                           years of servitude; so that instead of a rest of 40 years, we shall find that all was in confusion the greatest part of the
                           time. The idolatry of Israel, which shortly brought on the servitude under Eglon, commenced immediately after the conclusion
                           of these 40 years, when Salien begins to enumerate the years of Aod's government. Thus he does from one judge to another.
                           This system does not indeed make the text bend to uphold it, but it supposes that the sacred writer includes anarchy and servitude
                           under the name of <I>rest.</I> In these matters much is to be supplied by conjecture, and hence the chronological difficulties
                           which infidels propose, to invalidate the authority of the Scripture, can have but little weight, till the learned shall have
                           discovered the exact disposition of former times. The first judge of Israel was of the tribe of Juda. The second was chosen

                           signifies "praise," whence perhaps Josephus calls him <I>Judes</I> which has the same import. (Menochius) --- He was a descendant
                           of <I>Jemini</I> or Benjamin, by his son <I>Gera,</I> Genesis xlvi. 1. --- <I>Right.</I> Septuagint and many interpreters
                           agree, that Aod was "Ambidexter," a quality which Plato exhorted those who were designed for war, to strive to acquire. Several
                           of the heroes before Troy are praised on this account; and the Scripture takes particular notice of 700 citizens of Gabaa,
                           who could use both hands alike, and could hit even a hair with a stone, chap. xx. 16. The Jews explain <I>itter,</I> very
                           absurdly; Aod "had his right hand maimed or tied:" (Calmet) and Protestants render "a man left-handed." (Haydock) --- This
                           would be a very awkward recommendation for a warrior, though it is pretended that such are more resolute, and more difficult
                           to encounter than others. The number of the men at Gabaa who are praised for their skill, as well as the brave men of David,
                           (1 Paralipomenon xii. 2,) shews sufficiently that the term does not mean left-handed. But the Scripture here takes notice
                           that Aod could use his left hand so well, because he placed his dagger, contrary to custom, on his right side, and the motions
                           of his left hand would not be so narrowly watched. Rufin does not agree with the present text of Josephus, which indeed seems
                           very confused, saying, "that all the strength of Aod lay in his left hand." Gelenius also translates, <I>utraque manu ex æquo
                           promptus;</I> (Antiquities v. 5,) so that perhaps the Greek of Josephus may have been altered. --- <I>Presents;</I> that is,
                           tribute; an odious expression, instead of which the Scripture often puts presents, 1 Kings x. 27., and 1 Paralipomenon xviii.
                           2. No tribute was imposed in Persia till the reign of Darius Hystaspes; the subjects had to make presents to the king. (Herodotus

                           Hebrew, "Aod approached unto him, and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself, alone." It seems to have
                           been a private closet, to which he retired for greater secrecy, as his officers concluded that he was there only to ease nature.
                           (Haydock) --- It might be rendered, "a hall of audience." (Calmet) --- But the place where Aod presented the tribute, was
                           more probably of this description, and Eglon retired thence into a back parlour, and was followed by Aod, alone, ver. 24.
                           (Haydock) --- <I>A word.</I> What Aod, who was judge and chief magistrate of Israel, did on this occasion, was by a special
                           inspiration of God: but such things are not to be imitated by private men. (Challoner; St. Augustine, q. 20.; Numbers xxv.
                           Worthington) --- Hebrew, "a thing (message, &amp;c.) from God, (Aleim) or the gods." Probably the king would imagine that
                           he was speaking of the idols at Galgal, and being full of awe for them, would be off his guard, and rise up out of respect.
                           See Numbers xxiii. 18., and Exodus iii. 5. (Calmet) --- But as the word <I>Elohim</I> was only abusively applied to idols
                           and to great men, Aod might say with truth, that he had a word or an errand from <I>Elohim</I> to the king, without minding
                           in what sense Eglon would take the expression. See St. Augustine, q. 20., and Origen, hom. 4. Though God permitted this king
                           to attack his people, and to scourge them for a time, he did not approve of his injustice, and now authorized the chief magistrate
                           of Israel to revenge their wrongs. (Haydock) --- God is the arbiter of our lives, and may order whomsoever he pleases to put
                           us to death. But the doctrine of J. Huss, who preached, "It is lawful for every subject to kill any tyrant," was condemned
                           in the Council of Constance. David severely punished the man who pretended that he had slain Saul. The first Christians never
                           entered into any revolt against those cruel and impious emperors who oppressed them, and whose title to the throne was evidently
                           unjust. See Romans xiii. 1. Under what government are all satisfied, or of the same religion with the sovereign? Even if any
                           should pretend that they have an order from God to kill a tyrant, they must give proof of their commission to the lawful superiors,
                           or them must expect to be treated as fanatical impostors. (Calmet) --- <I>Throne;</I> or Hebrew, "seat." The throne of state
                           would not probably be placed in a retired chamber. (Haydock) --- The king rose up out of respect to the deity; (Menochius)
                           and at the same moment, Aod plunged the dagger into his bowels. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           The Hebrews use the letter <I>p</I> to express this number; and, as it is very like their <I>c,</I> which stands for 20, Houbigant
                           suspects that he first number is a mistake of the transcribers. Usher confesses that it is "extremely improbable" that Aod
                           should have governed so long, after he had slain Eglon, as he must have been at that time, about 40 years old; and the Israelites
                           were not often so constant for such a length of time. (Houbigant, Proleg.) --- But this difficulty does not affect Usher,
                           as he brings Aod forward only in the 80th year from the peace of Othoniel; and instead of allowing him 80 years of peaceful
                           sway, he says Samgar appeared after him; but, it seems, both together did not reign a year, since in that 80th year, he commences
                           the servitude, which Jabin brought upon Israel, from the year of the world 2679 till 2699, and peace was not restored by Barac

                           His reign seems to have been short, and only perhaps extended over the tribes of Juda, Simeon, and Dan, while Debbora governed
                           in another part. Some exclude him from the list of judges. But Josephus, Origen, &amp;c., allow his title, with most of the
                           moderns. (Calmet) --- The Alex.[Alexandrian?] Chronicle gives his reign of 24 years, which Salien would understand, as if
                           he had acted under the orders of Aod, when the latter was grown too old, if the author had not said that "after the death
                           of Aod, Samgar, his son, judged Israel 24 years," which he subtracts from the 80 years allotted to Aod. He makes Bocci succeed

                           those, which are used in Palestine, as eight feet long; and, at the thick end, 10 inches round, with a kind of spade, to clean
                           the plough, while the other end is very sharp. Samgar might probably use such an instrument. From its being mentioned, we
                           may gather that he did not engage the enemy in a pitched battle, (Calmet) but as he could find an opportunity. Thus Samson
                           slew 1000 of the same nation with the jaw-bone of an ass, chap xv. (Haydock) --- <I>Defended.</I> Hebrew and Septuagint, "saved,"
                           which shews that he was a proper judge. (Menochius) --- It is true, he did not rescue the Israelites entirely, but he stood
                           up in their defence. (Calmet) --- The duration of his government is not specified, nor is it said that the land rested, because
                           he ruled for a short time only: Josephus says not quite a year; and the <I>roads</I> were continually infested with the incursions
                           of the Philistines on the south, and of the Chanaanites on the North, chap. v. 6. Samgar seems to have been a ploughman, and
                           he seized the first weapon that came to hand. The Hungarians and Spaniards formerly defended themselves against the attacks
                           of the Turks and Moors with their plough-shares, in memory of which the Spaniards long after went armed to plough. The most
