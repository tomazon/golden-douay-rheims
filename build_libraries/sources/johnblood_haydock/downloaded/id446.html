                           Hebrew is obscure, "Whoever has separated, or made a singular vow; the souls to the Lord according to thy estimation." (Calmet)
                           --- Septuagint, "shall vow as it were the price of a soul to the Lord." (Haydock) --- The person or the beast shall belong
                           to the Lord; but if it be redeemed, the priests shall fix a price, according to the following regulations. Whatever was vowed
                           must be subject to these rules, or it shall remain for the service of the altar. The priests may sell it, if it be an impure
                           animal. Those which were fit for sacrifice, were to be immolated, ver. 9, &amp;c. No change of them was allowed, lest a worse
                           should ever be substituted for a better; (Calmet) and because God is better pleased with things that are offered to him by
                           vow. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           The Rabbins say this fifth part went towards repairing the temple. We may suppose it was laid on to indemnify the priests,

                           had purchased them, the priests would have been able to sell them again at the return of every jubilee. At that period, even
                           the former proprietor would not obtain a title to possess them for ever; (ver. 21,) and therefore he would not need to pay

                           particularly consecrated to him by vow, as Samuel was. (Calmet) --- A vow must be concerning some greater good to which we
                           are not otherwise bound. Such vows are agreeable to God, and can never be broken without sin. See Genesis xxxi. 13 and 1 Timothy

                           houses were demolished, the land belonged to the priests for ever, so that they could only let it out to laymen for a certain
                           rent. Moses thus devoted the Amalecites to destruction; (Exodus xvii. 14) and Saul had orders to put in execution what he
                           had denounced, 1 Kings xv. It is doubtful whether people could thus devote their children and slaves. Most authors suppose,
                           that it was necessary that God or the nation at large should pronounce such a sentence, as was done with respect to Achan,
                           Josue viii. See Numbers xxi. 2 and Judges xi. 31. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Grotius says, only public enemies and deserters could be thus devoted. Other men and women were only consecrated for ever

                           Abraham and Jacob paid tithes, out of devotion, Genesis xiv. and xxviii. 22. Moses first made a law on this subject, which
                           began to be in force when the Hebrews had obtained quiet possession of Chanaan. The people paid them more exactly when they
                           were determined to keep God's law, and had pious princes at their head, 2 Paralipomenon xxxi. 5. At other times they were
                           very negligent, Malachias iii. 10. This forced Esdras to appoint inspectors, <I>Namnim,</I> to collect them. The Pharisees
                           affected a degree of exactitude in this respect, (Luke xi. 42 and Matthew xxiii. 23,) paying what some Jews do not suppose
                           to be necessary, though our Saviour says it was. Since the destruction of the temple the Jews pay none. The first-fruits and
                           tithes of wheat, barley, figs, raisins, olives, pomegranates, and dates, were required, though it be not certain what quantity
                           of the first-fruits was given; some say between the 40th and the 60th part of the produce. Wine and wool were also to be offered.
                           The tithes were taken after the first-fruits and the heaved oblations (<I>thorume</I>) were paid. They belonged to the Levites,
                           and these gave a tithe to the priests, Numbers xviii. 28. See chap. xix. 24. The Eastern kings required a tithe of their subjects,
                           for the support of their families, 1 Kings viii. 15. God does the like, Malachias iii. 10. The Persians, Carthaginians, Greeks,
                           Romans, and even the Arabs and Scythians, religiously paid their tithes in honour of their false gods. See Cyrop. iv. and
                           Q. Curtius iv. 2.; Herodotus ii. 135.; Pliny, [Natural History?] xii. 14.; Mela. ii. 5, &amp;c. The Romans often consecrate
                           the tithes of their spoils to Hercules, as the Carthaginians did also. The Scythians sent them to Apollo. (Solin 27, &amp;c.)
                           (Calmet) --- Scaliger and Amama dispose the tithes, and the oblations of the Hebrews, in the following order. Supposing a
                           person's annual produce amount to 6000 bushels, an oblation (<I>thorume</I>) of at least 100 was to be made to the priests:
                           out of the remaining 5900, a first tithe of 590 belonged to the Levites, out of which they paid 59 to the priests. The residue,
                           of 5310 bushels, paid a second tithe of 531, to be consumed in feasts in the temple, (a custom which the ancient Christians
                           imitated in their love-feasts, called <I>agape; </I>Calmet) The original produce was thus reduced to 4779 bushels; and both
                           the tithes amounted to 1121 and the oblation to 100. The thorume consisted of flour dressed, and of oil, wine (Amama) and
                           wool, (Calmet) to be given to the priests on the feast of Pentecost, chap. xxiii. 15. It could not be less than the 60th part
                           of the produce, (Ezechiel xlv. 13.) and it was necessary to pay it before any could be used in the family. Hence these oblations
                           are often called <I>first-fruits,</I> and have been confounded with those sheaves which were to be offered at the beginning
                           of harvest. (Amama)</FONT></P><B>
