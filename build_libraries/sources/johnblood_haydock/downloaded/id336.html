                           <p><strong>Notes &amp; Commentary:</strong></p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 1.</strong> <i>Blessed,</i> with fecundity. Barrenness was deemed a curse. (Calmet)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 2. </strong><i>Fear,</i> &amp;c. God confirms the dominion of man over all animals, though he must exercise
                           it now by compulsion; they will not obey always without reluctance, as they would have done in the state of innocence. (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 3.</strong> <i>Meat.</i> The more religious, at least, had hitherto abstained from flesh, being content with
                           herbs, &amp;c.: which had been expressly granted. Now, the salt waters of the deluge had vitiated the earth, its plants were
                           no longer so nutritive. (Menochius) --- God gives leave to eat flesh meat, but with some restriction, that we may still learn
                           to obey. (Worthington)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 4.</strong> <i>With blood.</i> This was a matter of indifference in itself, like the forbidden fruit. But
                           God gave the prohibition, to keep people at a greater distance from imbruing their hands in the blood of others, which nevertheless
                           we know some have drunk! He would also assert his dominion over all things; the blood or life of animals being reserved to
                           be offered in sacrifice to him, instead of the life of man, Leviticus xvii. 11. Blood of brutes is gross and unwholesome.
                           (Menochius) --- The apostles required this law to be observed by the first Christians, that the Jews might not be disgusted:
                           but, after a competent time had been allowed them, the Church thought proper to alter this discipline. (St. Augustine, contra
                           Faust. xxxii. 13.)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 5.</strong> <i>At the hand;</i> a Hebrew idiom. God orders an ox to be stoned, which had slain a man, Exodus
                           xxi. 28. --- <i>Man,</i> (hominis) <i>every man,</i> (viri) <i>brother.</i> By these three terms, God inculcates a horror
                           of bloodshed; because we are all of the same nature, ought to act like generous men, and to consider every individual as a
                           brother, since we spring from the same stock. (Menochius)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 6.</strong> <i>Shed.</i> God had not subjected Cain to this law of retaliation, as he was the first murderer,
                           and the earth was unpeopled. (Haydock) --- Here he declares, that it is just to inflict such a punishment on the offender.
                           (Menochius) --- Judges are hence authorized to punish murderers with death. (Calmet) --- The general law, <i>thou shalt not
                           kill,</i> admits of exceptions, and forbids killing by private authority, or out of revenge. (Haydock) --- <i>The blood of
                           your lives,</i> may signify the blood on which your life depends; or, according to the Rabbin, it is a prohibition of suicide,
                           which one would think is so contrary to the first law of nature, self-preservation, as to require no prohibition; and yet,
                           to the scandal of philosophers, some have written in its defence! (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 10.</strong> <i>Soul...in birds,</i> &amp;c. The covenant of God is made with animals, only in as much as
                           they are subservient to man. (Du Hamel) --- The Egyptians adored most of them; and many oriental nations, and even philosophers,
                           pretended they had intelligent souls, and could speak a rational language, which some of them would have the people believe
                           they could understand. (Calmet) --- This was the case of those great impostors Apollonius of Tyena, Mahomet, &amp;c. (Haydock)
                           --- Moses shews sufficiently that beasts were neither divinities nor rational. (Calmet)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 13.</strong> <i>My</i> rain <i>bow.</i> This had been from the beginning; but it was not before appointed
                           for a sign that the earth should no more be destroyed by water. It is styled God's bow, on account of its beauty and grandeur.
                           (Menochius) (Ecclesiasticus xliii. 12.) --- "As the rain-bow, which makes its appearance in the clouds, borrows all its effulgence
                           from the sun, so those only who acknowledge the glory of Christ in God's clouds, and do not seek their own glory, will escape
                           destruction in the deluge," St. Augustine, contra Faust. ii. 21.</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 16.</strong> <i>Remember;</i> or I shall cause men to reflect, when they see the rain-bow, of the horrors
                           of the deluge, and of my gracious promises and covenant.</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 18.</strong> <i>Chanaan,</i> who, it seems, is here mentioned to his shame, having first discovered and told
                           his father that Noe was drunk. He was probably but young at the time, being born after the deluge.</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 20.</strong> <i>A husbandman.</i> Hebrew, literally "a man of the earth." (Haydock) --- <i>To till,</i> perhaps
                           with a plough, which he is said to have invented. (Menochius)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 21.</strong> <i>Drunk.</i> Noe by the judgment of the fathers was not guilty of sin, in being overcome by
                           wine; because he knew not the strength of it. (Challoner) --- <i>Wine,</i> Though vines had grown from the beginning, the
                           art of making wine seems not to have been discovered; and hence Noe's fault is much extenuated, and was at most only a venial
                           sin. (Menochius) --- His nakedness prefigured the desolate condition of Christ upon the cross, which was a scandal to the
                           Jews, and foolishness to the Gentiles. But by this folly we are made wise; we are redeemed, and enjoy the name of Christians.
                           Sem and Japheth represent the multitude of believers, Cham and Chanaan the audacity and impudence of all unbelievers. (St.
                           Augustine, contra Faust. xii. 24; City of God xvi. 2; St. Cyprian, ep. 63.[62.?] ad Cæcil.) (Worthington) --- Like the Manichees,
                           modern heretics are very free in condemning many innocent actions of the Patriarchs. (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 23.</strong> Neither ought we to be so quick-sighted in discovering the faults of any: which we often represent
                           as real, when they are only apparent. (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 25.</strong> <i>Cursed be Chanaan.</i> The <i>curses,</i> as well as the <i>blessings,</i> of the patriarchs
                           were <i>prophetical:</i> and this in particular is here recorded by Moses, for the children of Israel, who were to possess
                           the land of Chanaan. But why should Chanaan be cursed for his father's fault? The Hebrews answer, that he being then a boy
                           was the first that saw his grandfather's nakedness, and told his father Cham of it; and joined with him in laughing at it:
                           which drew upon him, rather than upon the rest of the children of Cham, this prophetical curse. (Challoner) --- Theodoret,
                           q. 57. The children of Sem executed this sentence, in exterminating many of the Chanaanites under Josue. (Worthington) ---
                           They perished for their own wickedness, which God foresaw, and revealed to Noe. Cham was severely punished by this denunciation
                           of his children's misery. See Milton, xi. 754. xii. 27; Deuteronomy ix. 4. (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 27.</strong> <i>Enlarge Japheth.</i> His name signifies latitude or enlargement. (Worthington) --- May <i>he,</i>
                           God, according to some; but more probably Japheth, of whom the rest of the sentence speaks. (Haydock) --- This was verified
                           by the extensive dominion of the children of Japheth, both in the islands and on the continent; more particularly, when the
                           Romans subdued the Jews, and posterity of Sem. (Menochius) --- Referring all this to the Church, the Gentiles entered in,
                           upon the refusal of the Jews, though preachers of that nation were the instruments of their conversion. Chanaan, in the mean
                           time, cherished his slavery, and seeks not to obtain the liberty and glory of the sons of God, in which he is a figure of
                           heretics, (Haydock) who serve to make Christians more upon their guard, and by persecuting them, exercise their patience and
                           increase their crown. (Worthington)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 29.</strong> <i>He died,</i> having witnessed the attempt of his children to build the tower of Babel, (we
                           may suppose with disapprobation) and having been concerned in the dispersion of nations. Some imagine he travelled eastward,
                           and founded the empire of China, which is denied by others. (Haydock) --- The fathers conclude that he had no children after
                           the deluge, as the Scripture mentions the world was divided among his three sons and their offspring. Perhaps the fabulous
                           account of Saturn is a perversion of Noe's history, as the three great pagan deities, Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto, to whom
                           Saturn gave the empire of heaven, seas and hell, may have been intended for the three sons of Noe. The Egyptians have attributed
                           to their Osiris the erecting of altars, cultivating vines, teaching agriculture, &amp;c. for which we have seen Noe was so
                           famous. (Calmet) --- This great and virtuous patriarch had only been dead two years, when the faithful Abraham was born, as
                           it were to succeed him in maintaining the cause of God. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins assert, that God gave some general laws
                           to Noe, which were necessarily to be observed by all who would obtain salvation: 1. To obey the laws; 2. Not to curse God;
                           3. Nor admit of any false god, nor of any superstition; 4. Not to marry one's mother, mother-in-law, sister by the same mother,
                           or another person's wife, nor to commit sins against nature; 5. Not to shed blood, that of beasts must be buried; 6. Not to
                           steal, or break one's word; 7. Not to eat the limb of a living creature. Maimonides thinks this last was given to Noe, the
                           rest to Adam. (Calmet)</p></font></font>
