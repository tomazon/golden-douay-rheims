                           was had to a supernatural interference, in a matter apparently of such a trifling nature. They ask why God should cause the

                           they boldly assert that all was an imposture. But this mode of argumentation is very delusive, if not impious. "<i>Who hath

                           our Saviour. Eliseus had left his house, going towards Samaria to meet the soldiers; and when they asked him where the prophet

                           continuance of the siege added fresh horrors. --- <i>Pieces</i> is not expressed in Hebrew: a sicle is understood. (Haydock)
                           --- Lyranus supposes that the whole ass was sold for about 38 crowns, (Haydock) or 130 livres; as we say commonly, "so much
                           a head." But interpreters generally assert that the price of the head alone is given; which shews more forcibly the greatness
                           of the famine. On other occasions the animal could not be eaten by the Jews. Artaxerxes was forced to kill his beasts of burden;
                           and an ass's head was then sold for 60 drachms, or 25 livres. When Hannibal besieged Casilinum, a mouse (or rat) was sold
                           for above 70, or for 200 denarii. (Pliny, [Natural History?] viii. 57.) (V. Max. vii. 6, 3.) --- <i>Cabe.</i> Sufficient measure
                           of corn for a man's daily sustenance. (Menochius) --- The fourth part would be about a gill. (Haydock) --- <i>Dung.</i> Bochart
                           maintains that "chick-peas" are designated. The Arabic <i>usnen</i> and <i>kali,</i> "pigeon <i>or</i> sparrows' dung," are
                           real eatables. Those who suppose that the Samaritans bought the dung of pigeons to use as salt or for food, or to burn, or
                           to manure the earth, &amp;c., produce not satisfactory reasons; no more than the Rabbins, who pretend that the corn which
                           they had picked up was taken from their crop. (Tr. Megil. 3., and the Scholastic History.) Junius and Fuller would translate
                           "belly," which is refuted by Bochart. (Anim. T. ii. B. i. 7.) Very disgusting things have often been used through extreme
                           hunger, (Grotius) and some sort of birds' dung is said to fatten oxen and swine. (Varro 38.; Pliny xvii. 9.) --- But what
                           nutriment can there be in that of pigeons, that people should go to buy it? (Calmet) --- Houbigant understands a sort of peas
                           to be meant. (Haydock) --- The Hebrews called them <i>kali</i> when they were parched; and such food was very common, 2 Kings
