                           Moses speaks of those who had to carry the sacred vessels. Those of 25 years old might perform some offices; (chap. viii.
                           24,) and even at 20, they began to serve the tabernacle, in the reign of David, (1 Paralipomenon xxiii. 24,) the fatigue being
                           then diminished, and the splendour of religion increasing. The Septuagint read 25 instead of 30, in this and all other places,
                           and some think that the Hebrew should be so too. The time for the admission of <I>priests</I> to their more august functions
                           is not specified, but was determined by themselves to be at least 20 years of age. (Outram, Sacrif. i. 7.) --- <I>To stand.</I>
                           This was the ordinary posture of the priests in the temple. The king alone was allowed to sit. (Maimonides) --- Hebrew, "all
                           that enter into the host, <I>or</I> army, to do the work in the tabernacle of the assembly," shall be of a competent age and
                           strength. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Necessity excused them on this occasion. Out of respect for the ark, the Levites were not allowed to behold or touch it uncovered.
                           (Calmet) --- <I>That hangeth before the door.</I> Hebrew, "the covering veil, and shall," &amp;c. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           the ark, Exodus xxv. 15. Other bars, like hand-barrows, were used to carry the ark and the other different vessels, after
                           they were folded up. Two Levites bore them on their shoulders. (Calmet) --- Perhaps the bars of the ark, after it was enveloped
                           with the three curtains, might project, so that the bearers might take hold of them. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           Some imagine this precept was not observed in the desert, as the people fed on manna. But might not they procure some flour

                           which might be upon the grate of the altar, where the sacred fire had been burning. This shews that the precept was already
                           observed. The Septuagint do not mention the ashes. But some copies, with Origen, (hom. iv.) and the Samaritan Pentateuch,
                           insert some words at the end of ver. 14, which Grotius believes have been omitted by the Massorets, in the present Hebrew
                           Bibles. "They shall take a purple veil, and fold up the laver and its foot, and put them in a covering of violet skins, and
                           place them upon the bars." (Calmet) --- The children of Caath were the most honoured among the Levites, as Moses and Aaron
                           sprung from the same family, Eleazar, the future pontiff, presided over them in a particular manner, while his younger brother
                           Ithamar, directed the rest. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>
