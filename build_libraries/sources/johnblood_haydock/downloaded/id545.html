                           This may be considered as a canticle of victory, containing a fervent prayer, which was presently followed with the desired
                           effect. --- <I>Aialon.</I> Hebrew, "Sun, in Gabaon, be silent; (move not) and thou, moon, in the valley of Aialon," or "of
                           the wood," which was probably not far from Gabaon. Josue had pursued the enemy at mid-day, to the west of that city, when
                           turning round, he addressed this wonderful command to the sun. It is supposed that the moon appeared at the same time. But
                           the meaning may only be, that the sun and the course of the stars should be interrupted for a time. (Calmet) --- <I>The sun
                           and the moon stood still in their habitation,</I> Hebrews iii. 11. (Menochius) --- Many have called in question this miracle,
                           with Maimonides, or have devised various means to explain it away, by having recourse to a parhelion or reflection of the
                           sun by a cloud, or to a light which was reverberated by the mountains, after the sun was set, &amp;c. (Pr&#339;dam iv. 6.;
                           Spinosa; Grotius; Le Clerc) --- But if these authors believe the Scriptures, they may spare themselves the trouble of devising
                           such improbable explanations, as this fact is constantly represented as a most striking miracle. If St. Paul (Hebrews xi.
                           30,) make no mention of it, he did not engage to specify every miracle that had occurred. He does not so much as mention Josue,
                           nor the passage of the Jordan, &amp;c., so that it is a matter of surprise that Grotius should adduce this negative argument,
                           to disprove the reality of the miracle. (Calmet) --- The pretended impossibility of it, or the inconvenience arising to the
                           fatigued soldiers from the long continuance of the day, will make but small impression upon those who consider, that God was
                           the chief agent; and that he who made all out of nothing, might easily stop the whole machinery of the world for a time, and
                           afterwards put it in motion again, without causing any derangement in the different parts. (Calmet) --- It is not material
                           whether the sun turn round the earth, or the contrary. (Haydock) --- The Hebrews generally supposed that the earth was immovable;
                           and on this idea Josue addresses the sun. Philosophers have devised various intricate systems: but the Scripture is expressed
                           in words suitable to the conceptions of the people. The exterior effect would be the same, whether the sun or the earth stood
                           still. Pagan authors have not mentioned this miracle, because none of the works of that age have come down to us. We find,
                           however, that they acknowledged a power in magic capable of effecting such a change.</FONT></P>

                           the same nature with that of the <I>wars of the Lord,</I> (Numbers xxi. 4,) containing an account of the most memorable occurrences
                           which concerned the people of Israel, <I>the just,</I> or <I>Ischuron,</I> Deuteronomy xxxiii. 5. Josephus ([Antiquities?]
                           v. 2,) says, such "records were kept in the archives of the temple." They were drawn up by people of character. The quotations
                           inserted are in a poetical style, as the book might contain various canticles, though the rest was written in prose. See 2
                           Kings i. 18. It might appear unnecessary for Josue to appeal to this work, as the fact in question was known to all. (Calmet)
                           --- But too great precaution could not be taken to prevent the danger of people calling in question the reality of the miracle.
                           If the book of the just was a more detailed history of facts, out of which this work of Josue has been compiled, as Theodoret
                           supposes, the author might very well remit the more inquisitive reader to that authentic source. (Haydock) --- <I>Midst.</I>

                           as it would have been on the west of his army. The battle had begun early in the morning, and the pursuit had lasted perhaps
                           four or five hours. (Calmet) --- <I>Day.</I> Hebrew, "about a whole day." Many think that a day here comprises 24 hours; and
                           as the sun had been above the horizon six hours, and continued other six, it must have been visible for the space of 36 hours,
                           as the Jews believe, and as it is specified in St. Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho. The author of Ecclesiasticus xlvi.
                           5, says, <I>Was not the sun stopped in his anger, and one day made as two?</I> that is, 24 hour long, allowing 12 unequal
                           ones to form a day, according to the reckoning of those times. Others suppose that the day of Josue might consist of 18 (Calmet)
                           or of 48 hours. But how would the soldiers be able to support such a fatigue? They had been marching all the preceding night
                           from Galgal. (Haydock) --- If they had stopped to take refreshment, their enemies would have escaped. Hence some of the Fathers
                           imagine, that God enabled his people to pursue them without taking any food. (St. Jerome, contra Jov. ii.) They might, however,
                           take some along with them, as it was then customary; and eat as they pursued, whenever they could find an opportunity. Josue
                           had given no prohibition; and Jonathan observed that his father, Saul, had troubled Israel, by following a different plan,
                           1 Kings xiv. 24. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           This word is not found in Hebrew, "and there was no day like that, before it, or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto,"
                           &amp;c. But God had often wrought miracles before, at the prayer of his servants. The difference between this day and all
                           others, must be therefore in the length, or in the stopping of the heavenly bodies. (Haydock) --- The long day which the prayer
                           of Ezechias procured, (4 Kings xx., and Isaias xxxviii.) consisted of 32 hours; or, supposing that the retrograde motion of
                           the sun was instantaneous on the dial, it might only be 22 hours in length. (Calmet) --- But if the day of Ezechias had been
                           even longer, the words of this text may be verified, that neither in times past, nor while the author lived, had any such
                           day been known. See Amama, p. 383. (Haydock) --- <I>Obeying.</I> God is ready to grant the requests of his servants, Isaias
                           lviii. 9. "We remark something still stronger, in the power which he has given to priests, to consecrate the body and blood
                           of Jesus Christ in the sacrament of the eucharist." (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Masius supposes, that here the quotation from the book of the just terminates. The Roman and Alexandrian Septuagint place
                           this verse at the end of the chapter. (Calmet) --- Grabe has it in both places with a star, to shew that it is taken from
                           Theodotion. (Haydock) --- In effect, Josue did not return to his camp till he had completed the business of the day, by destroying
                           the five kings. After which, he proceeded to conquer that part of the country. He might have designed to return, (Calmet)
                           and even have begun his march, (Du Hamel) when he was diverted from proceeding, by the news that the kings had been discovered.
                           So we often say, that a person does what he is on the point of doing. See Genesis xxxvii. 21., and Numbers xxxiv. 25.</FONT></P><B>

                           or territory. (Calmet) --- The kings had sought their own safety in flight, leaving their people to make their escape as well
                           as they could. But their cowardly behaviour only brought upon them a more dishonourable death. Josue and some of the forces
                           stopped in the environs of Maceda, while the rest pursued after the fugitives, and slew all that had not strength to enter
                           the fenced cities. (Haydock) --- Then all the army assembled round their leader, took Maceda, and completed the victory of
                           that most memorable day, by the ignominious death of the five kings. (Calmet) --- God permitted some to escape, lest the land
                           should be overrun with wild beasts; (Exodus xxiii. 29,) and to instruct us that his children must suffer tribulation, to prevent

                                    of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of the just? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not
                                    to go down the space of one day.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 There was not before, nor after, so long a day, the Lord obeying the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And Josue returned, with all Israel, into the camp of Galgal.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 For the five kings were fled, and had hid themselves in a cave of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And it was told Josue, that the five kings were found hid in a cave

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And he commanded them that were with him, saying: Roll great stones

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And stay you not, but pursue after the enemies, and kill all the hindermost

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter, and almost utterly

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And Josue gave orders, saying: Open the mouth of the cave, and bring

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And the ministers did as they were commanded: and they brought out

                                    gone, and put their feet upon the necks of them lying under them,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 He said again to them: Fear not, neither be ye dismayed, take courage,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And Josue struck, and slew them, and hanged them upon five gibbets;

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 *And when the sun was down, he commanded the soldiers to take them
