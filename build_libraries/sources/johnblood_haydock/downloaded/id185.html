                           was tormented in my interior, by the apprehensions and fears I have just related to you. I was under continual apprehension,

                           of excommunication, and censure pronounced against him. And I said with myself, will not false teachers undo, and render fruitless
                           all my endeavours to benefit the Church? Will not my letter alienate their minds from me? (Calmet) --- Our body had no ease,

                           the sorrow,</I> &amp;c. Sorrow for the loss of temporal goods, such as friends, riches, honours, &amp;c. is productive of
                           no good effects; but on the contrary, it ruins the constitution, exciting in the soul emotions of anger, murmuring, revenge,
                           and brooding melancholy. It moreover betrays an inordinate attachment to creatures. But sorrow for our own sins, and for those
                           of others, sufferings which we endure for the glory of God, work penance unto <SPAN lang=EN>salvation, which is lasting; or,
                           as the Greek has it, worketh penance unto salvation</SPAN>, of which we shall never repent. For tears shed in prayer unto
                           God are sweeter, says St. Augustine, (Psalm cxxvii.) than any pleasure that can be procured from the stage, &amp;c. The tears
                           of the saints are like sweet wine, which inebriate those who love God. (St. Augustine, Psalm lxxxiii.) --- Contrition, or
                           a hearty sorrow for sin, and not faith alone, as some pretend, is essential to salvation.</FONT></P><B>
