                           I have been sent to try thee to heal thee, and to deliver thy daughter-in-law. I am Raphael, one of the angels who assist
                           and appear before the brightness of God. Hereupon the two Tobies were startled, and fell prostrate on the ground, and were
                           seized with fear. And Raphael said, Fear not, Peace be with you. Bless the Lord all the days of your life, and sing his praises.

                           The angel having spoken thus to Tobias, the latter wrote this prayer as a monument of his joy, and said, Blessed be the Lord,
                           who is great in eternity, because his reign endures for ever. It is He who strikes, and who shews mercy, who conducts to the

                           our designs: but nothing can withstand the divine power. It is therefore proper to testify our gratitude for favours received,
