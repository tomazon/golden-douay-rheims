                           to do what he only permits. (Calmet) --- He abandoned them to their own perversity. (St. Jerome) (Deuteronomy xxxii. 21, 37.)

                           the observers <i>shall live in them?</i> ver. 11. He established the ceremonial law, at the same time. See Kimchi; Menochius,
                           &amp;c. Chaldean, "I have given them up to their foolish desires. They have established bad statutes and laws which will not

                           &amp;c. (Manasse Ben. Israel.) The precepts had also a bad effect, and were given in condescension to the weakness of the
                           people, (Origen) particularly the ceremonial part. (St. Just.[St. Justin Martyr?]; St. Chrysostom; St. Jerome, &amp;c.) ---
                           They did not justify, (St. Augustine) and were <i>not good,</i> compared with those of the new law. (St. Gregory, mor. xxviii.
                           9.) --- Thus Solon gave the Athenians "the best laws that they would receive," (Plutarch) though others more perfect might
                           have been devised. (Calmet)</font></p><b style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small; ">
