                           name of Amorrhites, 2 Kings xxi. 2. St. Jerome says that their city stood in the tribe of Benjamin; according to Josephus,
                           40 or 50 stadia north of Jerusalem. (Menochius) --- They alone had the prudence to submit, (Calmet) being terrified and converted

                           The Gabaonites addressed themselves to the first whom they met in the camp; and these made this remark to them before they
                           were brought into the presence of Josue. The Israelites could make no league with the Chanaanites, as with equals, but only
                           on condition that the latter should embrace the true religion, and acknowledge the dominion of the former. (Grotius) (Exodus

                           They did not mean to submit to servitude, but to make a league; otherwise they would not have needed to have recourse to such
                           artifices. (Calmet) --- But finding that no other terms could be procured, they were willing, at any rate, to save their lives.

                           So the queen Saba came to Solomon, 3 Kings x. The people of Gabaon being convinced that the God of Israel was the only true

                           being perhaps overjoyed that their friendship should be courted by so distant a nation. (Menochius) --- The high priest was
                           ordered to consult the Lord for Josue, at the door of the tabernacle, Exodus xxix. 42., and Numbers xxvii. 21. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           Were they bound to keep this promise? Some maintain the negative, as it was obtained by fraud, and therefore the Gabaonites
                           leave themselves to the mercy of Josue, (ver. 25,) who condemns them to perpetual servitude in the house of the Lord. He could
                           not, however, have taken away their lives after what had passed. The error was not essential, but the people might have obtained
                           the same conditions, if they had frankly told the truth. If we make a contract with a person who pretends to be of a nation
                           to which he does not belong, the contract will hold good. The deceit of the Gabaonites was punished as it deserved. But God
                           required that the conditions which were granted to them, should be diligently observed; and the family of Saul was severely
                           punished, because he had slain some of them, 3 Kings xxi. If the rest of the Chanaanites had changed their religion, and submitted
                           to the Israelites, they might have been preserved, as Rahab, and so many others were, with whom the pious kings scrupled not
                           to form alliances, chap. xi. 19., and Deuteronomy xx. 10, &amp;c. (Masius; Bonfrere; Calmet) --- They were, however, obliged
                           to yield possession of the land to the Israelites, and to renounce idolatry. The Gabaonites were willing to accede to these
                           conditions, and therefore Josue might justly make a peace with them. (Menochius)</FONT></FONT></P><B>

                           The five kings coming to attack the Gabaonites, these were forced to confess the truth, and to implore the assistance of the
                           Israelites; (Calmet) or perhaps Rahab had given information who they really were. (Menochius) --- Josue flew to their assistance

                           This is one reason why their lives were spared. But we have seen that they could not, with justice, have treated them as enemies,
                           on their submitting to the conditions required, even if they had not engaged themselves by oath. The Gabaonites knew with
                           what respect oaths were then kept by the Hebrews, even when they might have some specious pretext for dispensing themselves
                           from their obligation. "People had not yet begun to neglect God, as they do in the present age; nor did they allow themselves
                           the liberty of interpreting an oath, and accommodating the laws to their own humour, but they rather regulated their morals
                           by their prescription." <I>Nondum hæc quæ nunc tenet sæculum, negligentia Dei venerat,</I> &amp;c. (Livy iii.)</FONT></P><B>

                           The common people, only considering their own private advantage, murmured at the conduct of their leaders, as they supposed
                           that they were thus deprived of the plunder (Calmet) of many cities, and engaged in a dangerous war, with the five confederate
                           kings. But this war was in no degree detrimental to them, as they knew they had to subdue the whole country; and as for the
                           Gabaonites, they eased the people of Israel of a great burden, by doing the drudgery of the tabernacle, which otherwise must
                           have fallen upon them. (Haydock) --- These people were dispersed through the country, particularly in the cities of the priests
                           and Levites, whose servants they were forced to be. Gabaon was allotted to the priests. In latter ages, many of these poor
                           people being slain by Saul, &amp;c., David was obliged to select some others, called <I>Nathineans,</I> or "people given,"
                           to supply their place, (Calmet) unless these were all the remnants of the Gabaonites. (Menochius) --- Josephus (Jewish Wars
                           ii. 17,) speaks of the feast of <I>Xylophoria,</I> or "wood carrying," for the uses of the temple; and we read, (2 Esdras
                           x. 34,) that lots were cast <I>among the priests and the Levites, and the people, for the offering of wood,</I> &amp;c., which
                           seems to insinuate that the ancient institution was then altered. Many authors speak of a fountain which furnished the temple
                           with water, after the captivity, so that the service of the Gabaonites was not much wanted. We find no mention of them after
                           that time.</FONT></P><B>

                           which are under an anathema, and you deserve to be severely punished. (Calmet) --- But we shall fulfil our engagements with
                           you, only in punishment for your craftiness: (Haydock) you must submit to change your religion, (Calmet) which will be your
                           greatest blessing, (Haydock) and to perform the meanest offices, which may be considered as a sort of curse. It is thought
                           that some recompense was allowed the Gabaonites for their labour. (Serarius, q. 17.) --- This sentence was probably pronounced
                           at Galgal, (Calmet) though we might as well conclude that Josue would wait till he came to Gabaon, before he arraigned the
                           people, as no doubt they would make the best of their way out of the camp, as soon as they had obtained their request. (Haydock)
