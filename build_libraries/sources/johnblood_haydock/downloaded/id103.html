                           happy are we in having such a shepherd, so great, so good, so loving, so careful of our true welfare! O he is the true shepherd
                           indeed, that came down from heaven to seek the poor sheep that was lost; and when he found it, took it upon his own shoulders
                           to carry it home with joy to his heavenly fold. How dearly have his sheep cost him, for truly has he made good in himself
                           this sentence, that the <I>good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.</I> Let us then ever follow and obey, love and embrace
                           this true shepherd of our souls. (Meditations for every Day, vol. ii. p. 417.) The good pastor gives his life for his sheep;
                           he exposes himself to every danger to save them, no inclemency of the weather, no frost or cold, no rains or tempests, can
                           drive him from looking over his sheep, to defend them from the attacks of wolves, &amp;c. and like Jacob he might say, day
                           and night was I parched with heat, and with cold, and sleep departed from my eyes. (Genesis xl.[xxxi. 40.?]) Or, like David
                           speaking to Saul: "Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion or a bear, and took a ram out of the midst of
                           the flock; and I pursued after them, and struck them, and delivered it out of their mouths; and they arose up against me,
                           and I caught them by the throat, and I strangled them, and killed them." (1 Kings xvii.) This is a model of a true pastor.
                           But Jesus Christ has done more than this for us. He has exposed his life and his repose, he has spilled his blood, he delivered
                           himself to the fury of his enemies, and has offered himself as a victim on the cross to his eternal Father, to free us, his
                           lost sheep, from the most cruel wolf, the devil. And ever since his death he has always protected his Church, assisted and
                           consoled his distressed flock under all their sufferings, pouring into their hearts the consolations of the holy Spirit, and
                           sending to them holy teachers, to govern and lead them in the holy path of salvation. Such were the apostles and their successors,
                           the bishops and priests of the holy Catholic Church, whom he has sent, and will continue to send, to govern his flock to the
                           end of time. (Calmet.)</FONT></P><B>

                           also shews an union of nature and substance, and not only of love and affection, especially when taken with other words of

                           he has necessarily by always proceeding from the Father. Others expound it of a greater sanctity and fulness of grace above
                           all other saints, given to him, even as he was man. But 2ndly, he adds at the same time, and confirms what he had often told
                           them, that he was the <I>Son of God, sent into the world:</I> that his <I>works</I> shew that <I>he was in the Father, and
                           the Father in him.</I> by this they saw that he was far from recalling or contradicting what he had said before. And therefore
                           (ver. 30.[39.?]) <I>they sought to </I>apprehend him, and put him to death for <I>blasphemy.</I> (Witham) --- <I>Eloim,</I>
