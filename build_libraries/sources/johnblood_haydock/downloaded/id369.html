                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And they entered into the land of Egypt with others that went to buy.
                                    For the famine was in the land of Chanaan.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt, and corn was sold by
                                    his direction to the people. And when his brethren had bowed down to him,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And he knew them, he spoke as it were to strangers, somewhat roughly,
                                    asking them: Whence came you? They answered: From the land of Chanaan, to buy necessaries of life.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And though he knew his brethren, he was not known by them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And remembering the dreams, which formerly he had dreamed, he said
                                    to them: You are spies: you are come to view the weaker parts of the land.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 But they said: It is not so, my lord; but thy servants are come to
                                    buy food.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 We are all the sons of one man: we are come as peaceable men, neither

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And he answered them: It is otherwise: you are come to consider the
                                    unfenced parts of this land.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 But they said: We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one
                                    man in the land of Chanaan: the youngest is with our father, the other is not living.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 He saith, This is it that I said: You are spies.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 I shall now presently try what you are: by the health of Pharao, you
                                    shall not depart hence, until your youngest brother come.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall be in prison, till what
                                    you have said be proved, whether it be true or false: or else by the health of Pharao you are spies.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 So he put them in prison three days.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And the third day he brought them out of prison, and said: Do as I
                                    have said, and you shall live: for I fear God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 If you be peaceable men, let one of your brethren be bound in prison:
                                    and go ye your ways, and carry the corn that you have bought, unto your houses.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 *And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may find your words
                                    to be true, and you may not die. They did as he had said.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And they talked one to another: We deserve to suffer these things,
                                    because we have sinned against our brother, seeing the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear: therefore
                                    is this affliction come upon us.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And Ruben, one of them, said: Did not I say to you: *Do not sin against
                                    the boy: and you would not hear me? Behold his blood is required.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And they knew not that Joseph understood, because he spoke to them
                                    by an interpreter.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And he turned himself away a little while, and wept: and returning,
                                    he spoke to them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And taking Simeon, and binding him in their presence, he commanded
                                    his servants to fill their sacks with wheat, and to put every man's money again in their sacks, and to give them besides provisions
                                    for the way: and they did so.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 But they having loaded their asses with the corn went their way.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And one of them opening his sack, to give his beast provender in the
                                    inn, saw the money in the sack's mouth,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And said to his brethren: My money is given me again; behold it is
                                    in the sack. And they were astonished, and troubled, and said to one another: What is this that God hath done unto us?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Chanaan, and they
                                    told him all things that had befallen them, saying:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 The lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us to be spies
                                    of the country.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 And we answered him: We are peaceable men, and we mean no plot.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 We are twelve brethren born of one father: one is not living, the
                                    youngest is with our father in the land of Chanaan.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And he said to us: Hereby shall I know that you are peaceable men:
                                    Leave one of your brethren with me, and take ye necessary provision for your houses, and go your ways,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know you are not
                                    spies: and you may receive this man again, that is kept in prison: and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 When they had told this, they poured out their corn, and every man
                                    found his money tied in the mouth of his sack: and all being astonished together,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 Their father Jacob said: You have made me to be without children:
                                    Joseph is not living, Simeon is kept in bonds, and Benjamin you will take away: all these evils are fallen upon me.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 And Ruben answered him: Kill my two sons, if I bring him not again
                                    to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will restore him to thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 But he said: My son shall not go down with you: his brother is dead,
                                    and he is left alone: if any mischief befall him in the land to which you go, you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow
                                    to hell.</font></p>
