                           <i>The temple.</i> This plan of a temple, which was here shewn to the prophet in a vision, partly had relation to the material
                           temple, which was to be rebuilt: and partly, in a mystical sense, to the spiritual temple of God, the Church of Christ. (Challoner)
                           --- The description seems grander than Solomon's; and yet Zorobabel's temple was meaner than his. Hence this prophecy, and
                           those of Aggeus and Zacharias, cannot be understood of it, but of the Church. (St. Jerome; St. Augustine, City of God xviii.
                           45.) (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           The word <i>side</i> is here equivocal, like Hebrew <i>tsela,</i> sometimes denoting the boards, and at other times the apartments
                           round the temple, except on the west, over against the sanctuary, which seems to be the case here. It is true, we shall not
                           easily find sixty-six chambers. But the Hebrew, &amp;c., have only thirty-three. (Calmet) --- Villalpand rightly translated
                           <i>anterides,</i> (ver. 5.) but here he substitutes <i>trabes,</i> "beams or thick planks," to make it agree with 3 Kings
                           vi. 6., as if the same temple were meant. He also adopts the Vulgate <i>bis.</i> --- <i>Twice.</i> Hebrew <i>pehamim.</i>
                           Yet he afterwards places in his commentary, <i>pedes,</i> "thirty-three feet, that is twenty-two cubits," though feet are
                           never used at all as a measure in Scripture. (Houbigant)</font></p><b>

                           of the wall without; that is, equally five cubits. (Challoner) --- Protestants, "and that which was left, <i>was</i> the place
                           of the side-chambers that <i>were</i> within." (Haydock) --- To manifest a greater respect for God, the apartments of the
                           priests were twenty-five cubits distant from the temple, (ver. 10.) and divided by a wall, which Josephus describes as three
                           cubits high. (Antiquities viii. 2.) This wall was at the distance of five cubits from the temple. (Calmet)</font></p><b>
