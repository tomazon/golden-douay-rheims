                           as the Hebrews: they cut their hair, and rent their garments, to express their deep affliction, Isaias xv. 2. The Arabs would
                           deem it a great insult, and a piece of irreligion, to shave their beard. (Darvieux vii. p. 175.) Plutarch (Agesil) observes,
                           that the Lacedemonians obliged those who acted in a cowardly manner in war, to wear only one whisker: and Herodotus (ii. 121,)
                           takes notice of a person who, in contempt, cut off the beard on the right cheeks of some soldiers, who were placed to guard
                           the body of his brother, who had been gibbeted, having first made them drunk, that he might take away the body. The <i>garments</i>
                           (Aquila says, "the tunic," Septuagint, "the cloak,<i> or</i> mandua," which is a military garment used in Persia) were cut
                           (Calmet) for the same purpose, like our spencers, (Haydock) that the ambassadors might be exposed to derision, as breeches
                           were not usually worn, (Calmet) except by priests officiating. (Du Hamel) --- This was in contempt of circumcision. (Menochius)
                           --- Yet we cannot suppose, but that the ambassadors would procure something to cover themselves before they arrived at Jericho,
                           where they remained till their beard and the hair of their head (1 Paralipomenon xix.) were grown. The city was not rebuilt,
                           but there were some houses in the territory of that devoted place, Josue vi. 26. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           with the king of Micha, brought 22,000 into the field. The first he styles king "of the Mesopotamians," (1 Paralipomenon xix.

                                    died, and Hanon, his son, reigned in his stead.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 And David said: *I will shew kindness to Hanon, the son of Naas, as
                                    his father showed kindness to me. So David sent his servants to comfort him for the death of his father. But when the servants
                                    of David were come into the land of the children of Ammon,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 The princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon, their lord: Thinkest
                                    thou that for the honour of thy father, David hath sent comforters to thee, and hath not David rather sent his servants to
                                    thee to search, and spy into the city, and overthrow it?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 Wherefore Hanon took the servants of David, and shaved off the one
                                    half of their beards, and cut away half of their garments, even to the buttocks, and sent them away.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 When this was told David, he sent to meet them: for the men were sadly
                                    put to confusion, and David commanded them, <i>saying:</i> Stay at Jericho, till your beards be grown, and then return.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And the children of Ammon seeing that they had done an injury to David,
                                    sent and hired the Syrians of Rohob, and the Syrians of Soba, twenty thousand footmen, and of the king of Maacha a thousand
                                    men, and of Istob twelve thousand men.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And when David heard this, he sent Joab, and the whole army of warriors.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And the children of Ammon came out, and set their men in array at the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Then Joab, seeing that the battle was prepared against him, both before
                                    and behind, chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And the rest of the people he delivered to Abisai, his brother, who
                                    set them in array against the children of Ammon.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And Joab said: If the Syrians are too strong for me, then thou shalt
                                    help me: but if the children of Ammon are too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 Be of good courage, and let us fight for our people, and for the city

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And Joab, and the people that were with him, began to fight against
                                    the Syrians: and they immediately fled before him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrians were fled, they

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Then the Syrians, seeing that they had fallen before Israel, gathered
                                    themselves together.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 *And Adarezer sent and fetched the Syrians, that were beyond the river,
                                    and brought <i>over </i>their army: and Sobach, the captain of the host of Adarezer, was their general.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And when this was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and
                                    passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam: and the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought against him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David slew of the Syrians

                                    died.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And all the kings that were auxiliaries of Adarezer, seeing themselves
                                    overcome by Israel, were afraid and fled away, eight and fifty thousand men, before Israel. And they made peace with Israel,
                                    and served them: and the Syrians were afraid to help the children of Ammon any more.</font></p>
