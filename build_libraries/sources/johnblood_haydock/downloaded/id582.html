                           34. (Challoner; Worthington) --- Protestants supply, "<i>all their </i>inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes

                           <i>Looketh</i> with approbation. (Haydock) --- It is uncertain whether this prediction proceeded from God, from the devil,
                           or from the crafty Levite, (Calmet) who might answer as he thought the messengers wished him to do. (Menochius) --- Their
                           undertaking proved successful. But the devil, who knew the valour of the Danites, and the security of the citizens of Lais,
                           or even a man of moderate prudence and sagacity, might have told what would be the probable event of an attack in such circumstances.
                           (Calmet) --- Whether God approved or condemned the Levite's worship, he might speak by his mouth, as he did by that of Balaam.
                           (Haydock) --- But it is generally supposed that Jonathan was the organ of the devil, (Calmet) who answered with a degree of
                           obscurity, as he was accustomed, (Worthington) that, in any case, his credit might subsist. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Lais,</i> four miles from Paneas, towards Tyre. It is called <i>Lesem Dan;</i> (Josue xix. 47.) both the ancient and the
                           new name being joined together. --- <i>Rich,</i> Hebrew has almost as many different meanings as interpreters. De Dieu, "There
                           was no one to put them to shame, no chief magistrate." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "and <i>there was</i> no magistrate in the
                           land that might put them to shame in <i>any</i> thing." (Haydock) --- The citizens of Lais were perhaps a colony, and followed
                           the manners and religion of <i>Sidon,</i> but were at a day's journey from their territory; (Josephus) so that the latter
                           could not come to their assistance at a very short warning. The Danites were therefore encouraged to make the attack, (Calmet)
                           particularly as this city was confident in its own strength and riches, and made no alliance with any other. (Haydock) ---
                           Septuagint Alexandrian, &amp;c., read, <i>Aram</i> instead of <i>Adam.</i> "They had no commerce with Syria." But the Roman
                           edition (Calmet) has, "they are far off from the Sidonians, and have no (word or) commerce with man." The edition of Grabe
                           repeats a great part of this verse again; ver. 9, with an obelus.</font></p><b>

                           might not be known that a grandson of their lawgiver had been guilty of such impiety. They have not dared, however, to place
                           the letter in the same rank as the others, but have suspended it, (Calmet) as if it were suspected, says Michaelis. Abendana
                           relates, that by (or on) the authority of the ancients, this nun was added for the honour of Moses, lest his grandson might
                           appear to be the first little sacrificing priest of an idol. The Latin Vulgate reads the name of Moses; and I am convinced
                           that Moses, and not Manasses, ought to be understood: for how could a Levite have Manasses for his ancestor? (Grotius, Comm.
                           1753.) The Jews pretend that this relationship to the idolatrous king of Juda was not real, but figurative, in as much as
                           Jonathan acted like him. But thus the reproach would fall on Gersam, who is said to be the son of Manasses, while the idolatrous
                           priest is only placed as the son of Gersam. It is surely very absurd to say that he was the son of Manasses, because Manasses
                           acted like him 800 years afterwards; and Sol. Jarchi honestly confesses that, "for the honour of Moses nun was written, on
                           purpose to change the name, and it was written suspended, to indicate that it was not Manasses, but Moses." See Talmud Bava.
                           fol. 109. The letter has, however, sometimes been suspended half way, and sometimes uniformly inserted, so that it has at
                           last supplanted the genuine word. Some copies of the Septuagint agree with the Vulgate. (Brug.) --- Theodoret reads, "Jonathan,
                           the son of Manasses, of the son (<i><u>uiou</u></i>) of Gersam, of the son of Moses," retaining both words, in order to be
                           sure of the right one, as the copies varied. (Kennicott, Dis. 2., see Deuteronomy xxvii. 4.) Here we have a plain proof of
                           the liberties which the Jews have taken with their text. But the providence of God has left us means to detect their fraud,
                           by the Vulgate, &amp;c. In other difficulties of a like nature, the collation of ancient manuscripts and versions will generally
                           remove the uncertainty, and we may pronounce that the word of God has not been adulterated, though perhaps no one copy may
                           now represent it in all its genuine beauty and integrity. See Pr&#339;log. in SS. Mariana, C. xxiii. T. iii.; Menochius, &amp;c.
                           Protestants here follow the corrupted Hebrew, "Manasseh." (Haydock) --- <i>Captivity,</i> under the Philistines, when many
                           of their brethren were taken prisoners, (Psalm lxxvii. 61.; Tirinus) and when Samuel obliged all Israel to renounce idolatry,
                           1 Kings vii. 4. (Estius) --- Serarius, (q. 7.) or the sacred penman, speaks of a captivity, the particulars of which are not
                           recorded. Salien understands it of the captivity of Nephthali, 35 years before the rest of the kingdom of Israel was destroyed:
                           (4 Kings xv. 29.; Haydock) though Lyranus and Bonfrere explain it of the latter event, under Salmanaser, 4 Kings xvii. (Menochius)
                           --- We may allow that some interruptions took place under Samuel, David, &amp;c. (Salien) --- In effect, Jonathan and his
                           posterity might serve the idol of Michas till it was destroyed, at the same time as the ark was removed from Silo; (ver. 31.)
                           and afterwards they might relapse into their wonted impiety, and act in the character of priests to the golden calves of Jeroboam;
                           who, no doubt, would prefer such of the tribe of Levi as would come over to him, (Ezechiel xliv. 10.) though he was generally
                           forced to select his priests from the dregs of the people, 3 Kings xii. In this sense they might be priests in Dan, till Salmanaser
                           led them captives. But substituting <i>galoth</i> or <i>geloth,</i> we might translate, "till the <i>deliverance</i> of the
                           land," which was effected by Samuel; (Calmet) who not only repressed the Philistines, (1 Kings vii. 13.) but also persuaded
                           all Israel to renounce the service of idols, 1 Kings vii. 4. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                                    them an inheritance to dwell in: for unto that day they had not received their lot among the other tribes.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 So the children of Dan sent five most valiant men, of their stock and

                                    They went on their way, and when they came to Mount Ephraim, they went into the house of Michas, and rested there:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 And knowing the voice of the young man the Levite, and lodging with
                                    him, they said to him: Who brought thee hither? what dost thou here? why wouldst thou come hither?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 He answered them: Michas hath done such and such things for me, and
                                    hath hired me to be his priest.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 Then they desired him to consult the Lord, that they might know whether
                                    their journey should be prosperous, and the thing should have effect.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 He answered them: Go in peace: the Lord looketh on your way, and the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 So the five men going on came to Lais: and they saw how the people
                                    dwelt therein without any fear, according to the custom of the Sidonians, secure and easy, having no man at all to oppose
                                    them, being very rich, and living separated, at a distance from Sidon and from all men.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And they returned to their brethren in Saraa and Esthaol, who asked
                                    them what they had done? to whom they answered:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Arise, and let us go up to them: for we have seen the land <i>which

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 There went therefore of the kindred of Dan, to wit, from Saraa and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And going up they lodged in Cariathiarim of Juda: which place from
                                    that time is called the camp of Dan, and is behind Cariathiarim.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 From thence they passed into Mount Ephraim. And when they were come

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 The five men, that before had been sent to view the land of Lais,
                                    said to the rest of their brethren: You know that in these houses there is an ephod and theraphim, and a graven and a molten

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And the six hundred men stood before the door, appointed with their

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And they said to him: Hold thy peace, and put thy finger on thy mouth,

                                    of one man, or in a tribe and family in Israel?</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And he answered: You have taken away my gods which I have made me,
