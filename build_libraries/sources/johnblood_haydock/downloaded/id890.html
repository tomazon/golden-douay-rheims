                           The Septuagint omit the 20 verses following. But Grabe's edition has them marked with asterisks, (Haydock) as being supplied
                           from Theodotion, &amp;c. The Vatican copy gives a great part, with some circumstances which occur no where else, chap. xii.
                           24. (Calmet) --- The wife of Jeroboam is there called Ano, (Menochius) the elder sister of the queen of Egypt, Thekemina.
                           See chap. xi. 19; where Adad marries another sister. (Haydock) --- <I>Time.</I> This expression does not determine the year.
                           (St. Chrysostom, &amp;c.) --- The passage in the Vatican Septuagint seems to place this death before Jeroboam ascended the
                           throne: but it took place rather at the end of his reign, ver. 14. Abia seems to have been his eldest son, and fit for command;

                           As if the prophet, who could dive into futurity, could be thus imposed upon. Jeroboam was aware that he would be full of indignation
                           at the changes which had been introduced. He might also fear, lest his wife might be exposed to danger in (Calmet) or near
                           (Haydock) the enemy's country, (Calmet) and the people would have been more convinced of the vanity of their idols, if they
                           had seen that it was necessary to have recourse to a prophet of the true God. (Menochius) --- The mother might ask without
                           the least suspicion, "Will my son recover?" --- <I>Silo</I> might still be attached to the service of God, in consequence
                           of the ark residing there so long, and the presence of the revered Ahias; so that, if it formed a part of the dominions of
                           Israel, (Tirinus) as it was in the tribe of Ephraim, though nearer Jerusalem than Sichem, (Calmet) Jeroboam might reasonably
                           fear lest his wife should be treated with indignity. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>
