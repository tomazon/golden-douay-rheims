                           It does not signify, that to be a bishop or priest he must be a married man; nor that he must be a man who has but one wife
                           at a time; but that he must be a man who has never been married but once, or to one wife: because to be married more than
                           once, was looked upon as a mark of too great an inclination to sensual pleasures. It is true, at that time <SPAN lang=EN>a
                           man might be chosen to be a bishop or priest whose wife was living, but from that time </SPAN>he was to live with her as with
                           a sister. This St. Jerome testifies as to the discipline of the Latin Church. (Witham) --- The meaning is not that every bishop
                           should have a wife, (for St. Paul himself had none) but that no one should be admitted to the holy orders of bishop, priest,
                           or deacon, who had been married more than once. (Challoner) --- <I>Sober.</I>[2] The Greek rather signifies <I>watchful.</I>

                           answers, that priests were comprehended under the name of bishops, their functions being much the same, except as to the ordination
                           of the ministers of God. (Witham) --- After speaking of bishops he passes on to deacons, because priests are included in the

                           became manifested in the flesh, justifying or proving his divinity by the virtue of the Holy Spirit appearing in his miracles,
