                           <i>Tribute.</i> Aquila, and probably St. Jerome, translated, "cubit." Others suppose that <i>Amma,</i> or <i>Meteg-ama,</i>
                           is some unknown place, which David wrested from the hands of the Philistines. It is hardly probable that the Israelites would
                           have paid the latter tribute till the 20th year of his reign, (Calmet) or even till the 12th. (Salien) --- He might now force
                           them to pay tribute. (St. Jerome, &amp;c.) (Haydock) --- Perhaps a letter may have been transposed, and instead of Meteg,
                           we should read, "<i>Geth,</i> the mother," or metropolis, and its dependencies; (1 Paralipomenon xviii. 1.) or "he took Metec,
                           (Numbers xxxiii. 28.) and its mother," Geth, which reconciles the two passages. Chaldean, &amp;c., "he deprived them of the
                           advantage of the rivulet." Septuagint, "David took the separated" place, (Serarius) or the city of Geth. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           levelled the strong places with the ground. (Denis the Carthusian) --- Septuagint intimate that half were destroyed. (Calmet)
                           --- But the Hebrew rather implies that the greatest part was saved, "a full cord to save alive;" (Menochius) unless there
                           were three lots, and only one of them, larger indeed than the rest, spared. (Haydock) --- Death, or slavery, were the portion
                           of all who were taken in war. (Grotius, Jur. iii. 4, 20.) --- <i>Lex nulla capto parcit aut p&#339;nam impendit.</i> (Seneca)

                           in Paralipomenon. Adad, or "the sun," was the chief idol of Syria, and the kings inserted the name with their own; as Benadad
                           did. Josephus produces a fragment from Nicolaus of Damascus, in which he says that "Adad was king of Damascus, and of all
                           Syria, except Ph&#339;nicia, and was defeated by David....His successors took his name, as the kings of Egypt did that of
                           Ptolemy; and that the third in descent from this king, made an attack upon Samaria," and upon Achab. (Antiquities vii. 6.)

                           have 7000 <i>horsemen.</i> See how we have attempted to reconcile these texts, 1 Kings xiii. 5. Perhaps the numbers were expressed
                           by single letters; and the Hebrew final <i>n,</i> (700) has been mistaken for <i>z,</i> (7000) both here and [in] chap. x.
                           18. <i>Literis numeralibus non verbis antiquitus numeri concipiebantur.</i> (Scaliger, apud Walton prol.) --- "Will any other
                           hypothesis so naturally solve this repeated difficulty?" (Kennicott, Diss. on 1 Chronicles xi. p. 96 and 463.) --- Kimchi
                           thinks that the king's horse-guards are only specified here; and Salien supposes, that those who fought on chariots are also
                           included in Chronicles, as they are often styled horsemen, Isaias xxi. 7, 9. (Menochius) --- <i>Houghed.</i> Aquila, "destroyed."
                           He rendered them unfit for war, as Josue had done, (Josue xi. 6.) supposing that this was the import of the decree, forbidding
                           many horses to be kept, Deuteronomy xvii. 16. --- <i>Horses</i> is not expressed in Hebrew, though the Protestants supply
                           the word; as also, <i>for.</i> We should translate literally, "He left out of them 100 chariots;" (Haydock) as we read elsewhere,
                           that Adarezer had 1000. (Menochius) --- But this expression being unintelligible, no less than, "he houghed all the chariots,"
                           as the text stands at present in the original, may lead us to suspect that this verse has been inaccurately printed. Septuagint,
                           "David paralyzed, (or rendered useless) all the chariots; and 100 chariots were reserved for himself out of them." Josephus
                           says the rest of the 1000 chariots were burnt, 5000 horse slain, and 20,000 foot. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Syria, </i>which is styled <i>Aram</i> in Hebrew. The Septuagint have read <i>Edom,</i> or Idumea, as the two names have

                           as well as the title of the Psalm lix; and 1 Paralipomenon xviii. 12, says, <i>Abisai....slew of the Edomites, in the valley

                           Bosra for its capital. The salt-pits might be a great plain, about three miles south of Palmyra or Thadmor, which supplies
