                           the Euphrates, above Thapsacus. (Strabo) --- The captives were in those parts, though not present. (Calmet) --- <i>Opened,</i>

                           him three hundred barrels of oil to light his lamp, while he performed the task. (Rabbins) --- This hyperbole shews their
                           idea of its obscurity. (Calmet) --- <i>Amber,</i> (<i>electri</i>) a compound of four parts of gold and one of silver, (Pliny,
                           [Natural History?] xxxiii. 4.) more precious than either. (St. Jerome) --- It may also mean <i>orichalchum,</i> or a mixture
