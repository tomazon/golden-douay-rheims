                           <I>To the Angel of the church of Ephesus.</I> The great St. Timothy, who was bishop of Ephesus, died a glorious martyr about
                           this time. But as for the admonitions and reprehensions given in these letters, we must take notice, that they are given to
                           the faithful of each church, and not only to the bishops, as it appears by the words so often repeated. (Witham) --- <I>Angel.</I>
                           This could have been no other than St. Timothy, who was then bishop of Ephesus. We must not suppose the faults, which are
                           reproved by St. John, to belong individually to St. Timothy, but to some members of the Church. (Bossuet, and others) ---
                           <I>These things, saith he,&nbsp;who holdeth,</I> &amp;c. That is, Christ, or the Angel who represented Christ, as appeareth
                           by his titles repeated out of the last chapter. --- <I>And hast not failed,</I> or fainted, in opposing the teachers of false
                           doctrine. --- <I>Thou has left thy first charity,</I> or first fervour, a common, yet a very dangerous disposition, and especially
                           in a bishop, charged with the care of those under him. --- <I>Do penance</I>....practise <I>the first works,</I> return to
                           thy first fervour, or <I>I will remove thy candlestick out of its place.</I> The church of Ephesus is threatened, as in danger
                           to lose its faith, which faith should be transplanted and received in other places. It is&nbsp;what God has divers times permitted,
                           that churches flourishing in the profession of the true Christian faith should be perverted by infidelity and heresy, while
                           the faith hath been planted in other kingdoms of the world. I need not bring instances, where candlesticks have been removed
                           out of their places. (Witham) --- The Nicolaites were an infamous sect, who disturbed the rising Church by the superstitions
                           and all the impurities of paganism. See St. Augustine, de hæresib. --- <I>To him,</I> to every one <I>that overcometh, I will
                           give to eat of the tree of life,</I> (that is, eternal happiness, differently expressed in these letters) <I>which is in the
                           paradise of my God.</I> It is spoke in the person of Christ, as man. (Witham)</FONT></P>

                           bishop, or to his church, but a commendation for suffering in poverty and tribulation, when they were rich in grace. (Witham)
                           --- <I>Poverty.</I> He was poor in temporal things, but rich in grace and merits. --- <I>Thou art blasphemed</I> by those
                           false teachers, who call themselves Jews and Israelites, and the chosen people of God, waiting for the coming of the Messias,
                           but are not to be looked upon as such; having refused to own their true Messias, Jesus Christ, they are <I>the Synagogue of
                           Satan,</I> the greatest enemies of the true faith. --- <I>You shall have tribulation ten days,</I> which several here understand
                           for a long time, others for a short time, <I>ten times</I> being used in both senses. (Witham) --- The first death is that
                           of the body, the second of the soul. (Ven. Bede)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>To the Angel of the Church of Pergamus.</I>&nbsp; This Church is exhorted to <I>do penance,</I> and reprehended, as the
                           seat or throne of Satan. It is only said, that the bishop lives where this satanical seat is, that <I>he had not denied</I>
                           the <I>faith,</I> even under the persecution, when St. Antipas suffered martyrdom, of whom see Tillemont in the persecution
                           under Domitian, tom. ii, p. 119, and note 523; and Bollandus, April 11th; though the acts themselves be not of great authority.
                           --- Thou hast <I>them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaites,</I> which is compared to that of <EM>Balaam</EM>, who taught
                           <I>Balac to cast a</I> scandal <I>before the children of Israel,</I> by which they were seduced by the women of the Moabites,
                           and fell into the sin of fornication and idolatry. (Numbers xxiv. and xxxi. 16.) --- <I>To him that overcometh, I will give
                           the hidden manna;</I> a happiness in heaven, which the eye hath not seen, &amp;c. --- And <I>a white</I>[1]<I> stone,</I>
                           with <I>a new name written,</I> as a mark of the happiness promised to all those who shall conquer. An allusion to the custom
                           of giving a white stone to those that were tried and acquitted, and also to persons promoted to a dignity; and a black stone
                           to such as were found guilty. See Acts xxvi. 10. (Witham) --- This new name is the eternal recompense, unknown and despised
                           by worldlings, but esteemed by the faithful, who know the excellence of the rewards promised by God. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>To the Angel of the church of Thyatira.</I> Here is first a commendation of their constancy in the <I>faith,</I> in good
                           <I>works, charity, patience,</I> and <I>ministry,</I> which chiefly regards their bishop, whoever he was at that time. The
                           heretics, called Alogians, who rejected the Apocalypse, (chiefly because of the clear proofs of the divinity of the Word,
                           or Son of God) pretended that there was not church at Thyatira, when St. John is supposed to have written his Apocalypse.
                           They have no proof of this. This same church was afterwards perverted by the Montanists. See St. Epiphanius, hær. li. p. 455.
                           Here follows a reprehension that they permitted <I>the woman,</I> (here called by the name of <I>Jezabel,</I>[2] as was called
                           the wife of Achaz, who persecuted the true prophets, and protected the false ones, 3 Kings xviii.) <I>to seduce</I> the <I>servants</I>
                           of God, <I>to commit fornication,</I> and eat of things offered to idols. There is no probability that this Jezabel was wife
                           to the bishop of that church. Had this been true, the bishop would have deserved a reprehension much more severe than is here
                           given him. Alcazar thinks that by this woman was meant some heretical sect, or the corrupt synagogue of the Jews; but interpreters
                           commonly understand some powerful woman thereabout among the infamous Nicolaites, who by her authority and artifices, brought
                           many to embrace that sect. --- <I>I give her time to do penance; and she will not,</I> or would <I>not repent.</I> It is Christ
                           who speaks as God, for who but God gives sinners time to repent? --- <I>Behold, I will cast her into a bed,</I> &amp;c. Some
                           understand a bed of sickness, others of corporal death, others eternal torments in hell, where she, and <I>they</I> that sin
                           <I>with her,</I> shall be <I>in very great tribulation, unless</I> first <I>they do penance.</I> --- <I>All the churches shall
                           know that I am he, who searcheth the reins and hearts,</I> which God alone can do. See Psalm vii. 10.; Jeremias xvii. 10.;
                           &amp;c. It is God also who <EM>will give to every one....according to his works.</EM> See Psalm lxi. 13.; Proverbs xxiv. 12.;
                           Romans ii. 6. and in divers other places. --- <I>I will not put upon you any other weight,</I> &amp;c. That is, not the insupportable
                           burden of the Jewish ceremonies, to which teachers of false doctrines would have you subject. (Witham) --- Whoever does not
                           give in to this new doctrine of the Nicolaites and Gnostics, and does not approve the deep and abstruse doctrines of Satan,
                           which they teach, shall have no new weight or punishment. Let them keep the doctrine once delivered. (Calmet) --- Yet in the
                           faith which you have already learnt, remain steadfast, <I>till I come.</I> --- To them who shall <I>overcome,</I> &amp;c.
                           <I>I will give power over</I> or above all <I>nations.</I> This shews that the saints, who are with Christ our Lord in heaven,
                           receive power from him to preside over nations, and provinces, as patrons; and shall come with him at the end of the world
                           to execute his will against those who have not kept his commandments. (Challoner) --- <I>End.</I> This alludes to the day
                           of judgment, when the faithful shall sit on thrones with Christ. And he shall inherit the morning star of perpetual bliss,
                           that shall never set. --- They shall triumph over all the wicked world, and under me <I>shall rule them,</I> as it were, <I>with
                           a rod of iron,</I> being so much exalted above them. --- As <EM>the vessel of a potter,</EM> shall all their present greatness
                           <I>be broken.</I> To every such faithful servant, I will give <I>the morning star,</I> another expression to signify eternal
                           light, or eternal happiness. (Witham) </FONT></P>

                           which he says is found in the Alexandrian and several other manuscripts. But neither the Oxford edition of 1675, nor that
                           at Amsterdam of 1711, take notice of this reading in any one manuscript. As for that one manuscript of Alexandria, I guess
                           by Walton's Polyglot, that it cannot well be read in that place. And though it is likely that the author of the Syriac version
                           may have found that reading, yet there is nothing for it in the Arabic or Ethiopic, nor in the vulgar Latin, which, as Dr.

                           uxorem tuam in St. Cyprian ad Antonianum, edit. Rig. p. 72, and in the edition of Dr. Fell, published in Amsterdam, in the
                           year 1701, p. 248, where he says in the note mark <I>a,</I> cui interpretationi favent illa Græca exemplaria, quæ legunt,&nbsp;<I><U>gunaika
                           sou</U>,</I> but he did not think fit to tell us where any such manuscripts were to be found, nor have I heard that they have
                           been seen by any one. It is certain St. Epiphanius did not find&nbsp;<I><U>sou</U>,</I> nor think this the true reading, when
                           in the heresy of the Alogians, by Jezabel, he understands Maximilla, Priscilla, or Quintilla, in Marcion's time.</FONT></P></FONT><FONT
