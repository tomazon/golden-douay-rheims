                           Many believe that Moses spent the whole time in obtaining pardon. Hiscuni agrees herein with the other Rabbins, only he thinks
                           Moses was all the time in the tabernacle. Other 40 days, or a third rigid fast, were requisite to obtain the second tables
                           of the law, as the text seems to insinuate, (ver. 25., and chap. x. 10,) unless Moses repeat what he has here asserted, as
                           many able chronologers suppose. (Torneil; Usher; &amp;c.) (Calmet) (Tirinus) --- The former opinion is maintained, however,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 *And the Lord gave me two tables of stone written with the finger

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 I cast the tables out of my hands, and broke them in your sight.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And I fell down before the Lord, as before, forty days and nights,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 For I feared his indignation and anger, wherewith being moved against

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And he was exceeding angry against Aaron also, and would have destroyed

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And your sin that you had committed, that is, the calf, I took, and
                                    burned it with fire, and breaking it into pieces, until it was as small as dust, I threw it into the torrent which cometh
                                    down from the mountain.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And when he sent you from Cades-barne, saying: Go up, and possess

                                    out, that he might kill them in the wilderness,</font></p>
