                           This word is not in Hebrew or the Septuagint; neither does Moses mean to insinuate, that God would take his place in conducting
                           the people; but only that after he should be no more, the divine Providence would no less watch over his people, and direct

                           <I>Canticle;</I> because God commanded him the same day to ascend the mount, chap. xxxii. 48. (Calmet) --- But Moses did not
                           speak the discourses recorded in this book, at one time. After he had, therefore, dismissed the people with his blessing,
                           and with an assurance that God would be with their newly appointed leader, he committed to writing what he had delivered by
                           God's order, at different times, and gave a copy of the Pentateuch to the priests, who were to keep it carefully on the side
                           of the ark, and explain it to the people, particularly every seventh year. The Jews understand <I>this law</I> to mean the
                           whole Pentateuch. It may denote also, more particularly (Haydock) Deuteronomy, as far as this place, or the 27th, and three
                           subsequent chapters of it. He gave two copies; one to be deposited beside the ark, and the other (ver. 26,) to be kept by
                           the priests. In all contracts of consequence, this method is observed, one copy being laid carefully by, and the other left
                           in the hands of those who may be concerned, Jeremias xxxii. 12. The Rabbins say that 13 copies were taken; one for each of
                           the 12 tribes, and one to be placed on the side of the ark. But of this new assertion we must not expect to hear any proof.

                           who must put the law in execution, and guide their decisions by it. (Haydock) --- The mention of the <I>ark</I> in this place,
                           is to insinuate that the book was to be deposited on one side of it, ver. 26. The priests might carry the ark, if they thought
                           proper, (Menochius) as they did sometimes on the more solemn occasions; (Josue ii., and vi., and 1 Kings iv. 4,) though the
                           duty belonged to the Levites, Numbers iii., and iv. The pagans placed their sacred books in their temples, under the care
                           of the priests, who were obliged to transcribe them. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           commenced. Hebrew, "at the extremity of seven years." The sabbatic years began at the expiration of every six years, (Haydock)
                           after the land of Chanaan was conquered, (Calmet) or perhaps after the passage of the Jordan, which took place soon after
                           this discourse was made. Josue spent above six years in the conquest of the country, and then divided it among the tribes.
                           The seventh year was the first <I>year of remission;</I> as the Israelites, particularly on the east side of the Jordan, had
                           already enjoyed the benefits of the country for a considerable time. If they had been required to wait till the whole had
                           been conquered, no sabbatical year would have been of obligation before the reign of Solomon, as he had still some of the
                           devoted nations to subdue. See Exodus xxiii., and Leviticus xxv. (Salien, in the year before Christ 1463) At this time, the
                           ark was removed from Galgala to Silo, where it remained about 350 years, Josue xviii. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           in the temple the words of the covenant, which have been lately discovered, 4 Kings xxiii. 2. (Calmet) --- But Esdras, a Levite,
                           did the like; (1 Esdras viii. 2,) and the command seems to be directed chiefly to the priests, from whose number Moses was

                           before, but also the remaining part of the book of Deuteronomy. This Moses would write before his death, and deliver entire,

                           happened in past ages, and what would befall the transgressors of God's law. (Haydock) --- The canticle, containing an abridgment
                           of the book of Deuteronomy, (Calmet) as the latter did of the whole law, was to be copied out more frequently, (Haydock) and

                           shews (Calmet) that it was the Lord; (ver. 14.) for he swore to give the land of Israel. The Septuagint insert the words Moses
                           and the Lord. "And Moses commanded Josue....the land which the Lord swore." (Haydock) --- This is the first time that God
                           addresses Josue, in order to confirm his authority. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           But not within, (Menochius) according to the generality of interpreters, whom Calmet follows, Exodus xxv. 10. But here he
                           adopts the contrary opinion of <I>Jonathan</I> and Grotius, and asserts that this writing, containing the 29th, 30th, and
                           31st chapters, on thin boards, was placed in the ark, beside the tables of the law, in the same manner as the Philistines
                           placed it in&nbsp;a coffer of gold, 1 Kings vi. 8. We read (3 Kings viii. 9,) that there was <I>nothing in the ark except
                           the two tables,</I> which might be true at the time that book was written; though St. Paul (Hebrews ix. 4,) tells us, that
                           <I>the golden pot, and the rod of Aaron,</I> were <I>in</I> the <I>ark.</I> If they were there in the days when the author
                           of the first book of Kings lived, the passage in question must be understood with these exceptions. (Calmet) --- This difficulty
                           cannot, however, be now easily decided, as the Scripture often uses the word <I>in</I> to denote near to, &amp;c., ver. 14.
                           The coffer of the Philistines might also be on the <I>outside</I> of the ark. (Haydock) --- <I>Thee.</I> This act of ratification
                           of the covenant, which had been made at Horeb, 39 years before, (Calmet) was placed in or near the ark. (Haydock) --- The
                           three chapters, of which it probably consisted, seem to have been what was discovered in the reign of Josias; as the threats
                           and blessings which they contain, would naturally tend to make a strong impression upon all, 4 Kings xxii. 8. (Calmet) ---
                           Kennicott thinks that Helcias discovered the very manuscript, which Moses had written with his own hand, and which he deposited
                           neither in, nor fastened to any side of the ark, but only placed by the side (<I>mitsad, juxta,</I> Noldius) of it, or upon
                           the same table; so that it might not be taken by the Philistines, but kept in some suitable place. (Dis. ii.) It is surprising
                           that Huet cites Jonathan as delivering this sentiment, <I>in <I><FONT size=3>caps</FONT><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman"><FONT
