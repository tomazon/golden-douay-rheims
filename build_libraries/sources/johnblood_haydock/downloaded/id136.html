                           do these prophets now advise him to stay away, and disobey the inspiration? No: their dissuasion was not the effect of inspiration,
                           but the expression of their tenderness and affection for him, which made them fear what they saw he was going to endure. (Denis
                           the Carthusian) --- Hence St. Paul disregarded their entreaties, as well as the imminent dangers that every where stared him
                           in the face. See his heroic answer to the melting entreaties of the faithful of Cęsarea, and their final acquiescence: "the

                           It is supposed that these daughters of St. Philip had made a vow of virginity, or at least remained in that state out of a
                           motive of religion. St. Jerome thinks in reward of this they were gifted with a prophetic spirit. (Lib. i. chap. 24. cont.

                           forsake Moses.</I> In the Greek, to depart or apostatize from Moses and the law. This is more than was true. For St. Paul
                           circumcised Timothy, (chap. xvi.) and did not absolutely hinder converts who had been Jews, from practising the Jewish ceremonies.
                           (Witham) --- There is a manifest falsity in this accusation against St. Paul. He had never commanded or advised the Jews,
                           to whom he had preached, to renounce the law, abandon the ceremonies of Moses, or reject the ancient customs of the nation.
                           He had never hindered any one from following in this respect the bias of his inclinations. He had indeed defended the liberty
                           of the converts from these ceremonies; he had taught that Christ had taken away the <I>necessity</I> of this yoke; but he
                           left them at liberty still to carry it if they pleased. (Calmet) --- For these things were not then to be sought after as
                           necessary, nor yet to be condemned as sacrilegious. The law of Moses at that time was dead, but not deadly. (St. Augustine,
                           ep. lxxxii.) --- These considerations will sufficiently explain the apostle's motive for submitting on this occasion to one
                           of their ceremonies. He became all to all, that he might gain all to Christ. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           to have some share in the merits of those who do forsake it, by contributing part of their substance to their support. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           but not for those men who were justly pursued. Hence the Jews looking upon Paul as a blasphemer, they did not think they violated
                           this asylum by forcibly removing Paul from the temple; but lest he might return, they fastened the entrance-gates.</FONT></P><B>

                           and killed 400. The leader escaped, and was heard of no more. This was in the 13th year of Claudius, about three years before
