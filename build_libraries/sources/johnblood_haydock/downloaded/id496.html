                           Tacitus remarks, that "a great part of Judea is covered with villages, though towns may likewise be found in the country.
                           (Hist. v. 8.) See 3 Kings iv. 13. Septuagint, "besides the towns of the Pherezites, which were very numerous." (Calmet) ---
                           The spies had not travelled in this county, when they gave an account of the walled towns being as high as heaven. But Moses
                           here informs us, that the cities on the east side of the Jordan were not much inferior to those on the west, and the land
                           was infested also with <I>giants,</I> ver. 13. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Yet out of the ruins they soon raised other strong cities, Numbers xxxii. 26. All the walls were not probably demolished,
                           (ver. 19,) but only a part, so that they might be repaired with no great labour or expense. The inhabitants were all destroyed,
                           that they might not pervert the Hebrews by their bad example; and because God had pronounced the sentence of death upon them,
                           in punishment of their crimes. Hebrew seems to insinuate, that the cities were destroyed only by the death of the inhabitants.
                           "We subjected them to anathema....utterly destroying the men," &amp;c. (Haydock) --- We devoted to utter ruin the men, women,

                           is no need, therefore, to suppose that this and similar passages have been inserted by a later writer. (Haydock) --- <I>Hermon,</I>
                           which profane authors commonly call Antilibanus, (Calmet) was a part of the range of the <I>mountains of Galaad,</I> by which

                           had other names for it, ver. 9. (Haydock) --- It does not appear that Moses went much beyond the torrent of Jeboc. But he
                           knew that the territory, as far as Hermon and Emath, belonged to the Hebrews, and he probably, sent some troops to take possession
                           of it. They did not, however, entirely banish the Hevites, that <I>dwelt from Baal-Hermon to the entering into Emath.</I>

                           Hebrew, "Raphaim." Og was the only survivor of this family, in Basan, though there were other giants dispersed throughout
                           the land, 1 Paralipomenon xx. 6. (Tirinus) --- Some of the <I>stock of Rapha,</I> were also seen afterwards at Geth, but they
                           did not reign in the country of their fathers, as Og alone did at this time, Josue xv. 14., and xvii. 15. Hebrew may be, "Now
                           Og, king of Basan, was a remnant of the Raphaim." (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "for, moreover, Og....was left of the Raphaim."&nbsp;<I>His
                           bed</I> was 13½ feet long, and 6½ broad, taking the cubit at 18 inches, with Arbuthnot; though Calmet allows 20½ French inches,
                           which are greater than ours. As beds are commonly made larger than the person who lies in them, he concludes that Og might
                           be 14 or 15 feet high, unless he was possessed with the same vanity as Alexander the Great, who caused beds five cubits long
                           to be left in his camp, when he returned from his Indian expedition, in order that the people might think that his soldiers
                           were of a gigantic stature. Allowances must here be made for a royal bed; and, at any rate, it will not easily be proved that
                           a human body might not exceed 12 or 15 feet in height, without injuring the just proportions, as Thomas Paine would have us
                           to believe. We know that the difference in size between the inhabitants of Shetland and of Patagonia is still very great;
                           and the people of the former island would act very irrationally, if they would not credit the existence of the Lincolnshire
                           ox, or of the large dray horses in London, because their own oxen are not bigger than mastiffs. See Watson, p. 26. --- <I>Iron.</I>
                           Bedsteads are frequently made of iron, brass, silver, or gold, in hot countries, for the sake of cleanliness and grandeur,
                           Proverbs xxv. 11., Esther i. 6. The Parthian kings reserved to themselves the privilege of lying on golden beds. (Josephus,
                           [Antiquities?] xx. 20.) The Thebans made beds of iron and brass out of the spoils of Platea, and consecrated them to Juno.
                           (Thucydides, iii.) --- <I>Ammon.</I> Hebrew, "Behold his bedstead was of iron; is it not in Rabbath?" &amp;c. This town is
                           called Rabbatamana, by Polybius; and Ammana, by Eusebius, who says it had afterwards the name of Astarte, till Ptolemy Philadelphus
                           gave it the title of Philadelphia. It lay to the east of Jazer, not far from the Arnon. (Cellarius, iii. 14.) It is probable
                           that the bed of Og continued in this city, till it was taken by David, 2 Kings xxii. 30. How the Ammonites got possession
                           of it, we do not know. It seems that the account of it, and of Jair, (ver. 15,) have been given by some one who lived a long
                           time after these events had taken place. (Calmet) --- This conjecture, however, is not well founded, for though Moses was
                           addressing those who had been witnesses to these transactions not many months before, his appeal to them gives the strongest
                           authority to a narration, which was to be handed down to the latest posterity. They could attest the surprising stature of
                           that giant, whom they had slain, and their neighbours kept his bed as a proof of his having existed, the terror of all that
                           country. <I>Until this present day,</I> (ver. 14,) is an expression often used in Scripture, to denote an event which had
                           taken place at no very great distance of time, chap. xi. 4. Thus St. Matthew, (xxvii. 8,) writing about eight years after
                           the ascension of our Saviour, says, the <I>field was called Haceldama....even to this day.</I> See Josue viii. 29. (Haydock)
                           --- It is sufficient if the thing be still in the same state as it was before. (Menochius) --- <I>Hand. </I>Hebrew, "according
                           to the cubit of a man," from the elbow to the finger ends. (Calmet) --- Syriac, "of giants." Chaldean, "of the king;" whence
                           some have imagined, that the bed was nine times as long as the cubit of Og, which is very improbable. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins,
                           who delight in fables, say that this bed was used by Og only while he was in his infancy: for he grew to be 120 cubits high;
                           and some say his foot alone was this length. He would have hurled a mountain to overwhelm all the Hebrews at once, only a
                           bird, or some ants, made a hole in it, and the mountain falling upon his shoulders, he could not extricate his head, God causing
                           his teeth to grow ten cubits, and in this condition he was taken and killed by Moses. (Lyranus, &amp;c.) --- Noble discovery
                           of these blind guides! (Calmet) --- The poets have not been more extravagant in their descriptions of Typheus, or Typho, whose
                           name signifies <I>burning,</I> as well as that of Og, (or <I>h<SPAN lang=EN><FONT face="Times New Roman">ó</FONT></SPAN>g,</I>

                           will.</I> Moses flattered himself, that God's refusal to let him cross the Jordan, was only conditional; and therefore he
                           begs, with all humility, for leave to enter Chanaan, at the head of the people. But, though God had pardoned his fault, he
                           would not deprive Josue of the honour, which to fulfil the mystery, was reserved for him, Numbers xx. 12., and xxvi. 64. (Calmet)
                           --- Moses might very lawfully desire to behold a place, consecrated by the abode of the Patriarchs, and to be honoured still
                           more by the presence of the Messias, a happiness for which he had been labouring now forty years. (Du Hamel) --- <I>And Libanus.</I>
                           Whether this <I>and</I> be an explanation of what mountain he meant, (Tirinus) is a matter of doubt. He unquestionably desired
                           to see, and to put his people in possession of all the country designed for their inheritance, in which various fruitful mountains
                           appeared. That of Bethel was very high, and most delightful where Abraham and Jacob had dwelt. Moria and Sion, the future
                           seat of the temple, might also attract his notice, and the mountains of Judea, as well as all the other lofty hills, which
                           diversify the country from Idumea to Libanus. (Haydock) --- Egypt was a flat country. New and grander prospects now open to
                           his view. Libanus is styled Antilibanus by the Septuatint, and by profane authors, as it lies, in effect, to the land of the
                           Hebrews. Behind it C&#339;lostria extends, as far as Libanus. This mountain comprises four different hills, rising one above
                           another, and taking in a circuit of 300 miles. The first of these hills, Antilibanus, is remarkable for its fertility in corn;
                           the second has abundance of fine springs: but the third resembles an earthly paradise, being constantly adorned with fruits
                           and flowers. Cedars grow chiefly upon the fourth, amidst the snows which lie there perpetually, notwithstanding the burning
                           heats of the adjacent countries. <I>Lebanon</I> signifies both "whiteness and incense," for which it is very renowned. (Calmet)
                           --- De la Roque thinks that it is higher than the Alps or Pyrenees. It stands in the form of a horse-shoe, extending from
                           above Smyrna to Sidon, and thence towards Damascus, (Buffon) unless this be a part of Antilibanus, which runs north, from
                           Damascus, in a parallel direction to Libanus, and includes the hollow Syria. (Haydock) --- Serarius makes these two mountains
                           run eastward, almost from the Mediterranean sea, as Strabo (xvi.) and Ptolemy seem also to do. (Bonfrere)</FONT></P><B>

                           He is ordered to take a full view of the countries allotted by God to the Hebrews; and if we consider that the territory,
                           as far as the Euphrates, was promised to them, if they would continue to be faithful, and that it was made tributary, under
