                           that he sympathizes in their misery, and with groans prays in their behalf to the Lord, that he would vouchsafe to grant them
                           understanding, and open their eyes to the truth. Thus, though tenderly affected towards his countrymen, still he could not
                           dissemble the truth, or flatter them in their incredulity, and hardness of heart. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                                    them unto salvation.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 For I bear them witness, that they have a zeal of God, but not according
                                    to knowledge.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 For they, not knowing the justice of God, and seeking to establish
                                    their own, have not submitted themselves to the justice of God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 For the end of the law is Christ, unto justice to every one that believeth.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 For Moses wrote, that the justice which is of the law, *the man that
                                    shall do it, shall live by it.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 But the justice which is of faith, speaketh thus: *Say not in thine
                                    heart: Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 Or who shall descend into the deep? that is, to bring up Christ again
                                    from the dead.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 But what saith the Scripture? *The word is near thee, even in thy mouth,
                                    and in thy heart: that is the word of faith, which we preach:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 That if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in
                                    thy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 For, with the heart, we believe unto justice: but, with the mouth,
                                    confession is made unto salvation.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 For the Scripture saith: *Whosoever believeth in him, shall not be
                                    confounded.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek; for the same
                                    is Lord over all, rich to all that call upon him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 *For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? Or
                                    how shall they believe&nbsp;him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear, without a preacher?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And how can they preach, unless they be sent? as it is written: *How
                                    beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, of them that bring glad tidings of good things?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 But all do not obey the gospel. For Isaias saith: *Lord, who hath
                                    believed our report?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Faith then cometh by hearing: and hearing by the word of Christ.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 But I say: Have they not heard?* Yes, verily, their sound went forth
                                    over all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the whole world.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 But I say: Hath not Israel known? First Moses saith: *I will provoke
                                    you to jealousy by that which is not a nation: by a foolish nation I will anger you.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 But Isaias is bold, and saith: *I was found by them that did not seek
                                    me: I appeared openly to them that asked not after me.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 But to Israel he saith: *All the day long I have spread forth my hands
                                    to a people, that believeth not, and contradicteth me.</font></p>
