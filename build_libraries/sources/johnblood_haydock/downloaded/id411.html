                           towards himself, he begs to be informed what angel shall accompany him, and then proceeds to beg that God would still shew

                           before, that God said to Moses, <I>I know thee by name;</I> (St. Augustine, q. 193,) but he had used that expression in some

                           that the "gods mostly declare themselves by suddenly disappearing. They will not shew their faces." (Iliad. N. Grotius) ---
                           The <I>rock</I> was Christ, (Du Hamel) in whose sacred humanity we discern, at a distance, the majesty of God. (St. Augustine,
                           q. 154.) Moses saw the <I>hinder parts</I> of God, or what should happen to Jesus Christ in the latter days of the synagogue.
                           (Origen, hom. 12.) By this wonderful vision, God was pleased to declare that he was appeased. (Haydock)</FONT></P><FONT size=3
