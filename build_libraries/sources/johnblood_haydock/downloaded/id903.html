                           <i>Prophets.</i> Josephus ([Antiquities?] ix. 4.) intimates that this man was Abdias; (3 Kings xviii. 13.) and the Rabbins
                           pretend that Joram was the creditor. But these traditions are destitute of proof; and we know not that Abdias was a prophet.
                           (Calmet) --- <i>Serve him,</i> not as slaves, for the Hebrews were not thus to be sold, except they had commited some crime.
                           (Salien, the year before Christ 913.) See Leviticus xxv. 39. --- But the condition of mercenaries was perhaps little different;
                           (Haydock) and we find that people were sold for debt, Exodus xxi. 7., and Isaias l. 1. The same practice seems to have continued
                           till our Saviour's time, Matthew xviii. 25. Children were regarded as part of a person's property. The Romans, Athenians,
                           and other nations, claimed the same right over them. (Halicar. ii. p. 96.; Plutarch, in Solon et Lucullus.) The custom of
                           selling children continued for a long time in our [British] islands.</font></p><b>

                           <i>Anoint me,</i> for delicacy or health, Matthew vi. 17. (Menochius) --- To abstain from this unction, in the East, was a
                           great mortification, 2 Kings xiv. 2., and Deuteronomy xxviii. 40. Sanctius supposes, that the woman intended the oil to anoint
                           her body for interment, Matthew xxvi. 12. Hebrew <i>asuc,</i> occurs no where else, and my signify <i>a pot,</i> or "skin
                           of oil." The woman had nothing else. The original does not say what she intended to do with it. (Calmet) --- She might use
                           it for food: (3 Kings xvii. 12.) but the Septuagint agree with the Vulgate. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           no human transaction ought to impede what is divine. (St. Ambrose, ibid.[Luke x. 4.?]) In ancient comedies, slaves are always
                           represented in a hurry. The Jews will not salute any person when they are going to their synagogues, for fear of being distracted
                           in their devotions. (Calmet) --- Eliseus requires the utmost expedition, that the favour might be the greater, <i>Qui cito
                           dat, bis dat.</i> (Menochius) --- He would also prevent his servant from telling any one what he was about, that he might
                           not be touched with vanity, and thus hinder the miracle, which some think was nevertheless the case. (R. Salomon) (Theodoret,
                           q. 17.) (Tirinus)</font></p><b>

                           <i>The child is not risen.</i> By the staff of Eliseus is represented the rod of Moses, or the old law, which was incapable
                           of restoring life to mankind, then dead by sin. It was necessary that Christ himself should come in our flesh, to restore
                           us to life again. In this, Eliseus, as a figure of Christ, behoved to go in person to restore the dead child to life. (Challoner)
                           --- St. Augustine (contra Faust. xii. 35.) shews that many like things recorded in the Old Testament are figures of the New.
                           (Worthington) --- Many of the fathers observe, that this miracle was intended to shew the necessity of the Incarnation to
                           redeem lost man. The staff did not therefore restore life. Some lay the blame on Giezi; others on the woman, who required
                           the prophet to come in person; and others suppose that Eliseus followed herein his own spirit. But all this is destitute of
                           proof. (Calmet) --- He might alter his mind (Tirinus) at the request of the woman, and to imitate Elias; (3 Kings xvii. 21.)
                           all by God's direction. (Haydock) --- He had before trusted that God would perform the miracle by means of the staff, as he
                           did formerly by the rod of Moses, or by the mantle of Elias. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                                    face of the child.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 But the mother of the child said: As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul
                                    liveth, I will not leave thee. He arose, therefore, and followed her.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 But Giezi was gone before them, and laid the staff upon the face of
                                    the child, and there was no voice nor sense: and he returned to meet him, and told him, saying: The child is not risen.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 Eliseus, therefore, went into the house, and behold the child lay
                                    dead on his bed:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And going in, he shut the door upon him, and upon the child, and prayed
                                    to the Lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And he went up, and lay upon the child: and he put his mouth upon
                                    his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he bowed himself upon him, and the child's flesh
                                    grew warm.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 Then he returned and walked in the house, once to and fro: and he
                                    went up, and lay upon him: and the child gaped seven times, and opened his eyes.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And he called Giezi, and said to him: Call this Sunamitess. And she
                                    being called, went in to him: and he said: Take up thy son.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 She came and fell at his feet, and worshipped upon the ground: and
                                    took up her son, and went out.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 And Eliseus returned to Galgal, and there was a famine in the land,
                                    and the sons of the prophets dwelt before him: And he said to one of his servants: Set on the great pot, and boil pottage
                                    for the sons of the prophets.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 And one went out into the field to gather wild herbs: and he found
                                    something like a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds of the field, and filled his mantle, and coming back, he shred
                                    them into the pot of pottage; for he knew not what it was.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 And they poured it out for their companions to eat: and when they
                                    had tasted of the pottage, they cried out, saying: Death is in the pot, O man of God. And they could not eat thereof.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 But he said: Bring some meal. And when they had brought it, he cast
                                    it into the pot, and said: Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was now no bitterness in the pot.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 And a certain man came from Baalsalisa, bringing to the man of God,
                                    bread of the first-fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and new corn in his scrip. And he said: Give to the people, that they
                                    may eat.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 And his servant answered him: How much is this, that I should set
                                    it before a hundred men? He said again: Give to the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the Lord: They shall eat, and
                                    there shall be left.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 So he set it before them: and they ate, and there was left, according
                                    to the word of the Lord.</font></p>
