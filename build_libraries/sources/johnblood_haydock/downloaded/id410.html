                           he engraved on it the peculiar marks of the Egyptian idol, Apis; a square white spot on the forehead, and a crescent upon
                           the side. For it is generally believed, that this calf was designed to imitate that object of worship, to which the Hebrews
                           had been too much accustomed. (Acts vii. 39, 41.; St. Jerome in Osee iv.) The Egyptians adored not only the living ox, but
                           also its image, which they kept in their temple. (Porphyrius, Abst. ii. Mela. i. 8.) Some of the fathers think, that the head
                           of a calf only appeared. (St. Ambrose; Lactantius, &amp;c.) The rest of the figure was perhaps human, as Osiris was represented
                           with the head of an ox, as well as Astarte and Serapis. Monceau pretends that Aaron represented the true God, under the form
                           of a cherub, in which he falsely asserts he had appeared on Mount Sinai, and that his fault consisted only in giving occasion
                           of superstition to the people. But his opinion (though adopted by many Protestants, who excuse all from the guilt of idolatry,
                           but papists; Haydock) has been condemned at Rome, and refuted by Visorius, &amp;c. --- <i>Thy gods,</i> &amp;c. Thus spoke
                           the infatuated ringleaders. (Calmet) --- <i>And they changed their glory,</i> the true God, <i>into the likeness of a calf
                           that eateth grass,</i> Psalm cv. 19. --- <em>They forgot</em> God, who saved them, (Psalm cv. 21,) and <i>forsook</i> Him,
                           (Deuteronomy xxxii. 18,) to adore the calf. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           <i>The Lord.</i> The most sacred name of God is prostituted, (Judges xvii. and xviii.; Wisdom xiv. 21,) and an altar is erected
                           to this idol; though some pretend, that Aaron meant God to be adored under this similitude. His weakness was unaccountable,
                           and God would have slain him, had not Moses interceded, Deuteronomy ix. 20. Those who undertake to justify him, enter not
                           into the sentiments of God; and the offender himself pleads no excuse, but the violence of the people, ver. 23. (Salien) ---

                           head of the idolaters. Cornelius A Lapide insinuates, that he wished to supplant his brother in the supreme command; and after
                           a faint resistance, became the promoter of idolatry, to ingratiate himself with the people. The Scripture lays not this, however,

                           (de jejunio) understands impure play. The word means also to dance, and to play on instruments of music. <i>Ludere quæ vellem

                           gluttony, or debauchery, <i>vinoque se &amp; ventri dedisset.</i> (Haydock) --- They might get wine from Madian. (Salien)

                           <i>Calf.</i> Having manifested his disapprobation of the people's conduct, in the most signal manner, by breaking the two
                           tables; Moses proceeds to convince them of their stupidity, in adoring what he, in a few minutes, reduces to <i>powder.</i>
                           (Haydock) --- He breaks the calf in pieces, after burning it, and then grinds it to dust in a mill, with files; as the Hebrew,
                           Chaldean, and Septuagint intimate. He throws it, with contempt, into the torrent, which supplied the camp with <i>water,</i>
                           and thus caused the idolaters to swallow their gods. (Tirinus) -- Sa assures us, that he saw an alchymist pulverize gold,
                           which Abenezra says is done by means of some herbs, which turn the gold quite black, when it is melted. (Calmet) --- Some
                           use aquafortis for this purpose. (Tirinus) --- But from the account of Moses, (Deuteronomy ix. 21,) it seems fire, and the
                           mill, or file, reduced the gold into the smallest particles, so as to be even potable. Josephus ([Antiquities?] viii. 2,)
                           mentions the gold dust used by the courtiers of Solomon. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           hide, in some degree, the shame of their ancestors. For the same reason, Josephus passes over the whole in silence, and Philo
                           throws the blame on a few Egyptian converts. They might very probably be the ringleaders, as Numbers xi. 4. But the Hebrews
                           in general readily gave in to the delusion, 1 Corinthians x. 7. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           The fornication with the Moabites, was followed by the death of 24,000, Numbers xxv. 9. So that St. Paul cannot refer to it,

                           they were visited afterwards, ver. 34. Though God was appeased, (ver. 14,) so as not to destroy the whole multitude, Moses
                           thought it a very arduous task to obtain a full reconciliation, notwithstanding the exemplary vengeance he had taken of the
                           ringleaders. Hence he addresses himself to God with the greatest humility, and with such earnestness as scarcely seems justifiable,
                           if we understand that he put his own eternal salvation at stake. But he makes an impossible supposition, or proposal, which
                           he knew God would not admit, to extort as it were the requested favour. As he is willing to die for his people, God pardons

                           Hebrews in the wilderness, were all partly designed to chastise this first act of idolatry. Calmet explains this of the devastation
                           caused by the Levites, as he supposes the narration of Moses does not observe the order of time. He thinks Moses expostulated
                           with the people, and was then sent by God to punish them; and while they were unarmed, (chap. xxxiii. 5,) the Levites fell
                           upon them. Then Moses removed the tabernacle out of the camp, and obtained of God that he would go before them, and not an
                           angel only, ver. 34. and chap. xxxiii. 17. Moses continued full forty days, standing or lying prostrate on the mount, before
                           the Lord, to obtain the pardon of his people, Deuteronomy ix. 25. and x. 10. At the expiration of which term he returned,
                           with an order to prepare two other tables of stone, on which, after a supplication of the same length of time, he obtained
                           the law to be again engraven, chap. xxxiv. 28. The favour cost him therefore 120 days' earnest prayer; and yet how little
