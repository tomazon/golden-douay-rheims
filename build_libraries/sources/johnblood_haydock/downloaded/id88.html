                           into Judas not all at once, but by degrees. He first gained possession by avarice, next by theft, and lastly he impelled him
                           to the blackest treachery and cruel parricide. The Scripture only says that Satan had entered into him when he was entirely
                           abandoned to iniquity, had hardened his heart against all grace, and shut his ears against every instruction of Jesus. In
                           like manner the Scripture says of a good man, who is strengthened in grace, that the Holy Spirit dwells in him. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           into a cup, takes it in his right hand, elevates it, blesses it, tastes, and gives it round to the invited. Our Saviour on

                           IS MY BODY. See the annotations on the same words of consecration, Matthew xxvi. 26.; Mark xiv. 22. and 1 Corinthians xi.
                           24. --- <I>Do this for a commemoration of me.</I> By these words he gave a power and precept to them, and their successors,
                           to all bishops and priests, to consecrate and offer up the same; yet so, that they are only the ministers and instruments
                           of Jesus Christ, who instituted this sacrifice, this and all other sacraments, who is the chief and principal Priest, or offerer.
                           It is Christ that chiefly consecrates and changes the elements of bread and wine into his own body and blood; it is he that
                           chiefly and principally forgiveth sins in the sacraments of baptism, penance, &amp;c. It is what St. Augustine so often repeats
                           against the Donatists, that it is Christ that baptizeth, though the instrumental minister be a sinner or a heretic; and this
                           is what all Catholics confess and profess. --- The holy sacrifice and sacrament is to be offered and received with a devout
                           and grateful remembrance of Christ's benefits, and especially of his sufferings and death for all mankind. But to teach that
                           it is a bare, though devout memorial, or <I>a remembrance only,</I> so as to exclude the <I>real presence</I> of Christ, under
                           the outward appearances of bread and wine, is inconsistent with the constant belief and consent of all Christian churches,
                           both of the west and east, and contradicts the plain words of Christ. The learned bishop of Meaux, in his <I>Exposition of
                           the Catholic Faith,</I> desires all Christians to take notice, that Christ does not command them to remember him, but <I>to
                           take his body and blood</I> with a remembrance of him, and his benefits: this is the import of all the words, put together.
                           <EM>This is my body: this is my blood:</EM> do <EM>this in, for,</EM> or <EM>with a remembrance of me.</EM> (Witham) --- This
                           sacrifice and sacrament is to be continued in the Church to the end of the world, to shew forth the death of Christ, until
                           he cometh. But this commemoration, or remembrance, is by no means inconsistent with the real presence of his body and blood,
                           under these sacramental veils, which represent his death; on the contrary, it is the manner that he himself hath commanded,
                           of commemorating and celebrating his death, by offering in sacrifice, and receiving in the sacrament, that body and blood
                           by which we were redeemed. (Challoner) --- <I>Which is given,</I> &amp;c. He does not say, which shall be offered for you,
                           but which is offered;[2] because it was already a true sacrifice, in which Christ was truly present which he offered in advance
                           to his eternal Father, before that which he was going to offer the next day, in a different manner, on the cross. This sacrifice
                           was the consummation of the figurative Pasch, and the promise or pledge of the bloody offering, which Christ would make on
                           the cross. ... It was not the mere figure of his body, which was crucified, but the true body and the true blood. In the same
                           manner it is both the one and the other which are given, and really present, in the Eucharist. (Calmet) --- To renew the memory
                           of what I have this day done, in giving you my body; and what I shall do to-morrow, in delivering my blood and my life for
                           the whole world, do you hereafter what you now see me do. Take bread, break it, sand say, This is my body; and it will become
                           so really and truly, as it now is in my hands. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           thinking they should have need of swords against the attack of the traitor Judas, say, behold here two swords. (St. Cyril)
                           --- But if he had wished them to rely upon human aid, not even a hundred swords would have sufficed; but, if the power of
                           man was unnecessary in their regard, even two swords are sufficient, and more than are wanted. (St. Chrysostom) --- Even two
                           swords are sufficient testimony of our Saviour's having suffered spontaneously. One to shew that the apostles had courage
                           to contend for their Master, and that their Lord had the power of healing the servant, Malchus, who was maimed; the other,
                           which was not drawn from its scabbard, shews that the apostles were withheld from doing in his defence as much as they could
                           have done. (Ven. Bede)</FONT></P><B>

                           angel ... strengthening him.</I> Christ, our Redeemer, was truly God and truly man. And being made man by a real union of
                           his divine person and nature, to our weak and infirm human nature, he likewise took upon him our infirmities, sin excepted.
                           We must consider him as man, when we read of his being tempted in the wilderness, (Matthew iv.) when he wept at the raising
                           of Lazarus out of the grave, (John xi.) as often as we read of his praying; and here, when we read of his praying, and redoubling
                           his prayer in the garden, when we find him seized with fear, sadness, and grief: for though, as God, he could prevent and
                           hinder these passions and affections natural to man, yet he could also permit them to affect his human nature; as he permitted
                           himself to be seized with hunger, after fasting forty days; and so he permitted his human nature to be seized with fear and
                           grief in this garden of Gethsemani. As angels came and ministered to him after his fast in the wilderness, so an angel came
                           as it were to propose to him the divine decree, that he was to suffer and die for the redemption of mankind; and as man, he
                           is said to be strengthened and comforted by the angel: he, who as God, was Lord and maker of the angels, and so needed not
                           to be strengthened by his creatures. Besides what happened to Christ as man, were ordained as instructions for us. We are
                           taught by angels appearing, that they were not only ready to assist and wait upon Christ, but that, by the order of divine
                           Providence, they are also ready to assist us in our temptations and afflictions. --- <I>In an agony.</I> This Greek word signifies,
                           a strife, or combat; not that there could be any opposition or contrariety in the interior of Christ, whose human will was
                           always perfectly subject to his divine will, and the sensitive part to reason: yet, inasmuch as he was truly man, his human
                           nature dreaded all those sufferings which at that time were represented to his soul, and which in a few hours he was to undergo.
