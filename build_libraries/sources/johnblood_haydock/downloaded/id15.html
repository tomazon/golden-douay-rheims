                           "In those days," i.e. at the time of Jesus Christ, whose history this book contains. This expression does not always mean
                           that what is going to be narrated, happened immediately after that which precedes. (Bible de Vence) --- 'Tis a way of speaking
                           used by the Hebrews, even when there is no connection of time, as here are passed over 30 years of Christ's life. John the
                           Baptist was so called from his baptizing the people in water. The Jews took this for some token of their Messias: for they
                           said to him, (John i. 25,) <I>why dost thou baptize if thou art not the Christ?</I> --- <I>In the desert,</I> not in the house
                           of his Father Zacharias, as some pretend, but in a true wilderness, as appears by the circumstances of his food, apparel,
                           &amp;c. (Witham) --- The Baptist was about 30 years of age. He, as well as our Lord, in conformity with the Jewish law, did
                           not enter upon his public ministry before that age. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           the prince of an <I>Eremitical life.</I> (Hom. i. in Mar. and hom. i. in J. Bap.) Several sectarists do not approve of what
                           St. Chrysostom advances in favour of an ascetic life, and doing penance for past sins. (Bristow) --- <I>Do penance.</I>[1]
                           Beza would have it translated <I>repent.</I> We retain the ancient expression, consecrated in a manner by the use of the Church;
                           especially since a true conversion comprehends not only a change of mind, and a new life, but also a sorrow for past offences,
                           accompanied with self-denials, and some severities of a penitential life. --- <I>The kingdom of heaven,</I> which many times
                           signifies the present condition of Christ's Church. (Witham) --- In this and other places of holy writ, instead of "do penance,"
                           Protestants give "repent ye;" but general use has rendered&nbsp;<I><U>metanoia</U>,</I> by p&#339;nitentia, or penance; and
                           in this text, not any kind of penance, or grief for sins committed, but that which is joined with a desire of appeasing Him
                           who has been offended by sin; and this also by some external signs and works. For as many as heard this&nbsp;<I><U>metanoeite</U>,</I>
                           obeyed the voice, received from him the baptism of penance, confessed their sins, and it was said to them: <I>Bring forth
                           fruit worthy of repentance,</I> ver. 8. Therefore, all this was contained in the penance preached by the baptist. And here
                           we must not omit, that while sectarists preach faith alone, both the baptist and Jesus Christ begin their ministry with practising
                           and preaching penance. (Tirinus) --- P&#339;nitentiam agite,&nbsp;<I><U>metanoeite</U>.</I> Which word, according to the use
                           of the Scriptures and the holy fathers, does not only signify repentance and amendment of life, but also punishing past sins
                           by fasting, and such like penitential exercises. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           Christ. The Jews expected Elias would come in person to prepare the ways of the Messias; but John the Baptist was raised up
                           by God in the spirit and power of Elias, to precede the first coming of Jesus Christ, as Elias in person was to precede the

                           The word baptism signifies a <I>washing,</I> particularly when it is done by <I>immersion,</I> or by <I>dipping,</I> or <I>plunging</I>
                           a thing under water, which was formerly the ordinary way of administering the sacrament of baptism. But the Church, which
                           cannot change the least article of the Christian faith, is not so tied up in matters of discipline and ceremonies. Not only
                           the Catholic Church, but also the pretended reformed churches, have altered this primitive custom in giving the sacrament
                           of baptism, and now allow of baptism by pouring or sprinkling water on the person baptized; nay may of their ministers do
                           it now-a-days, by <I>filliping</I> a wet finger and thumb over the child's head, or by shaking a wet finger or two over the
                           child, which it is hard enough to call a baptizing in any sense. --- <I>Confessing their sins.</I>[3] We bring not this as
                           a proof for sacramental auricular confession; yet we may take notice, with Grotius, that it is a different thing for men <I>to
                           confess their sins,</I> and to confess themselves sinners. And here is expressed a declaring of particular sins, (as also
                           Acts xix. 18,) such as is recommended in the Protestant Common Prayer Book, in the visitation of the sick. (Witham) --- As
                           the baptism of John was an external profession of penance, to this it was meet to add an external or oral confession of sins;
                           and the more so, because such as were baptized by John, sought of him also, as we read in St. Luke, instructions how they
                           were to amend their lives; now it is naturally expected of whoever asks for similar advice, that he should expose the defects
                           of his past life. It is thus patients act with their physicians. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           and Sadducees.</I> These are the names of two sects at that time among the Jews. There are different conjectures about the
                           name of the Sadducees. This at least we find by the Gospels, and by the Acts of the Apostles, that they were a profane sort
                           of men, that made a jest of the resurrection, and of the existence of spirits, and of the immortality of souls. To these the
                           Pharisees were declared adversaries, as being a more religious sect, who pretended to be exact observers of the law, and also
                           of a great many traditions, which they had, or pretended to have, from their forefathers. St. Epiphanius (hær. 16, p. 34,)
                           derives their name from the Hebrew word <I>Pharas,</I> signifying <I>separated,</I> divided, or distinguished from others
                           by a more holy way of living. So the proud Pharisee (Luke xviii.) said of himself, <I>I am not like the rest of men,</I> &amp;c.
                           --- <I>Brood of vipers.</I> St. John the Baptist, and also our Saviour himself, (Matthew xxii. 33,) made use of this sharp

                           death. Or as some expound it, the destruction that was shortly to fall on the city of Jerusalem, on the temple, and the whole
                           nation of the Jews. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           into your hearts, to purify you from all your sins. (Bible de Vence) --- Here St. John tacitly insinuates the divinity of
                           Jesus Christ. He acknowledges his unworthiness, and it is this his humility that makes him the more acceptable to God, "I
                           ought to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?" (Tirinus) --- <I>Whose shoes I am not worthy to carry.</I> In St. Mark,
                           (chap. i. 7.) and in St. Luke, (iii. 21.) we read, <I>the latchet</I> of <I>whose shoes . . . I am not worthy to untie.</I>
                           The sense is the same, and St. John might use both these expressions. His meaning is, that he was not worthy to do him the
                           least, or the lowest service. --- <I>He shall baptize you in,</I> or with <I>the Holy Ghost,</I> i.e. by his baptism, he will

                           St. Luke, (iii. 21,) <I>the heavens were opened to him,</I> or in favour of him; and he saw <I>the Spirit of God descending:</I>
                           i.e. Christ himself saw the shape of the dove, which was also seen by the Baptist, as we find, John i. 33. And it was perhaps
                           seen by all that were present. --- <I>As a dove,</I> or like a dove in a bodily shape. The dove was an emblem of Christ's
                           meekness and innocence. (Witham) --- Calmet supposes that it was St. John that saw the Spirit of God descend thus upon Jesus
                           Christ. The Greek text is favourable to this interpretation. But the Vulgate supposes it was Jesus Christ himself. St. John
                           declares that he saw the Spirit; (John i. 32,) but this apparent disagreement is easily cleared, by supposing that both saw
                           the shape of the dove, and also the surrounding crowd, and that they all heard the voice of the Father, as it was heard by
                           the disciples in the transfiguration on Mount Thabor, (chap. xvii,) and by the crowd in the temple. John xii. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           great moment, that the Holy Ghost would have it repeated not only by three evangelists, Matthew, Mark and Luke, but also by
                           St. Peter, as a fourth evangelist, 2nd Peter chap. i. (Tirinus) --- In Greek, the emphatic article&nbsp;<U>o</U><I><U> uios

                           was not the adoptive, but natural Son of God, born of Him before all ages, and should silence every blasphemous tongue and
                           pen that can attempt to rob Jesus Christ of his divinity, and poor man of all hopes of salvation, through this God-man, Christ
                           the Lord. But if it here be asked, why Jesus Christ, who was innocence itself, yes, and the very essence of sanctity, condescended
                           so far as to be baptized with sinners, we answer, with the Holy Fathers, that it was, 1. to sanction the baptism and ministry
                           of his precursor; 2. not to lose this opportunity of teaching humility, by placing himself among sinners, as if he had stood
                           in need of the baptism of penance for the remission of sins; and lastly, with St. Ambrose, that it was to sanctify the waters,
                           and to give to them the virtue of cleansing men from their sins by the laver of baptism. (Haydock)</FONT></P>
