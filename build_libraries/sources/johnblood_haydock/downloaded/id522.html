                           and consequently this verse should be at the end of the last chapter, as it is placed in the celebrated editions of Michaelis
                           and Houbigant. The latter observes that, <I>beside that covenant,</I> &amp;c., shews, that the curses there recorded, are
                           not by way of explication of those mentioned in the preceding 27th chapter, "but of a quite different kind. The former are
                           denounced against those who violate the law of the decalogue, which was given at Horeb; neither do they threaten that the
                           chastisements shall be inflicted in this life: the latter maledictions threaten present punishments, and those of a public
                           nature." See chap. xxvii. 26. (Haydock) --- Josue put in execution in a more solemn manner, what Moses here describes, (Josue
                           viii. 30,) to intimate that Jesus would give the last finishing to the outlines of the old covenant.</FONT></P><B>

                           guilty, Moses would never have made them this reproach. "But he shews that they could not understand or obey, without God's
                           assistance,....and yet if....it be wanting, <I>si adjutorium Dei desit,</I> the vice of man is not on that account, deserving

                           Hitherto you have not been able to discern the designs of God in your regard: but now, being on the point of crossing the
                           Jordan, to take possession of the land which God had promised to your fathers, you ought to place an unbounded confidence
                           in him. Others read with an interrogation, which entirely removes the evil interpretation of the wicked, who pretend that
                           God requires impossibilities. "Hath not the Lord?" &amp;c. (Calmet) --- God sometimes delivers people over to a reprobate

                           v. 4. It may denote a poisonous bitter herb, as well as rass, which signifies "the head, gall, wormwood, aconite," &amp;c.
                           (Calmet) --- The <I>root</I> designates a mind secretly infected with idolatry, and the appetite, being once drunken with

                           by the sinner, <I>blessing,</I> that is, flattering himself in his sins with the imagination of peace, and so great an abundance

                           spoken of before, which being <I>drunken</I> with sin may attract, and by that means <I>consume</I> such as <I>thirst</I>
                           after the like evils. (Challoner) --- St. Jerome seems to have translated <I>sephoth</I> by <I>assumat,</I> as the manuscripts
                           and interpreters read, before the correction of Sixtus V, who adopted the other signification of the Hebrew <I>absumat.</I>
                           (Calmet) --- The sense however seems to be the same, as <I>evil communications corrupt good manners,</I> the wicked draw on
                           those who before were dry, or <I>thirsty,</I> and superior to the allurements of pleasure, but not quite so sincere and constant
                           as to shut out from their hearts the desire of tasting, what the man of the world so highly extols, and thus the just give
                           way to the temptation, and become the companion of the libertine and of the idolater, and of course share in his destruction.
                           The feasts of the idols were generally celebrated with the most dissolute mirth, which seemed more congenial to the depraved
                           heart of man, than the sober feasts, which the Lord allowed his people. The drunken revellings in honour of Bacchus, who was
                           worshipped in Arabia, &amp;c., were a disgrace to human nature. Yet it is well known with what eagerness the deluded pagans
                           joined in these <I>religious sports.</I> How prone to such excesses the Israelites also were, sacred history too plainly shews,
                           so that they might well be described as <I>thirsty,</I> and willing to imitate those who were already <I>drunk</I> with dissolute
                           pleasures; and this proverbial warning was not unnecessary to remind them what they had to expect from such conduct, at least
                           if the people should become generally addicted to the service of idols. The most terrible chastisements mentioned below, (ver.
                           20, &amp;c., and in the preceding chapters, and still <I>greater,</I> chap. xxviii. 61,) hung over their guilty heads. But
                           the man who should give occasion to such a defection from the Lord, and, like Jeroboam, cause <I>Israel to sin,</I> must remember
                           that he will have to suffer for the sins of all those whom he has perverted. Hence this cutting remark almost always accompanies
                           the mention of Jeroboam's name, <I>He made Israel to sin.</I> Such a one walked in <I>the way,</I> or imitated <I>the sins</I>
                           of the <I>house of Jeroboam,</I> &amp;c. A similar infamy and destruction attend arch-heretics and impostors. (Haydock) ---
                           Chaldean translates, "Let him not say.....lest he should add sins of ignorance to sins of pride." (Calmet) --- Septuagint,
                           "lest the innocent be involved in the destruction of the sinner." Cornelius a Lapide would leave out the negation, and translate,
                           "that the innocent may be," &amp;c. (Menochius) --- Bonfrere believes that <I>the earth</I> is to be understood; "and the
                           earth <I>drunken</I> or deluged with rain, may take away its former dryness, yet so as to be rendered unfit for cultivation."
                           The proverb affects those who wish for things which will prove destructive to them: so the man who expects to derive great
                           pleasure and advantage from the practice of idolatry, will be miserably deceived, and will only bring on his own ruin; or,
                           if his passions be gratified for a moment, he must, if he die in that state, endure eternal torments in destruction from the
                           face of the Lord. Homer (Odyssey) says, "Crimes prosper not; the low outstrips the quick." <I>Festina <I><FONT size=3>lent</FONT><FONT

                           and Romans adopt similar expressions, to denote the wrath and eagerness with which a person is actuated. "Fierce anger always

                           of Abraham, or of Moses, and only <I>newly come up;</I> (chap. xxxii. 17,) which was a sufficient proof that they were not

                           while he chose Israel for his peculiar people. Hence, if they followed another god, they were to be treated as rebels. Hebrew
                           may have another sense, "and from whom they have received nothing," Chaldean and Syriac. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "gods to

                           pretended to follow the worship of idols, they could surely place no confidence in them, knowing that they were either mere
                           creatures, or even the work of their own hands. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           full of surprise, at the miseries, which were inflicted upon the Jews, and upon their country, could not comprehend what might
                           have brought on so severe a chastisement, as they little suspected that it was their worshipping those gods, which they themselves
                           adored, ver. 2. But those who had been converted, and had been able to penetrate the secrets of God, by means of his gracious

                           to a disgraceful death, when he <I>came unto his own,</I> (John i.,) had served to complete their misery. (Haydock) --- Moses
                           resumes his discourse, and says that these chastisements had been reserved in the treasury of God's wrath, and he had not
                           denounced them to their father; but now, since he had told them so plainly, what they had to expect, they would be inexcusable
                           if they ran into the danger. Hebrew may signify, "The secrets of the Lord....are manifest to us." He has shewn us this favour,
                           in preference to other nations, Psalm cxlvi. 20. (Vatable) --- Secret things are known to God, while those only which are
                           manifest can be discerned by men. (Theodoret, q. 38.) (Worthington) --- Amama wonders at the <I>negligence</I> of B. Luther's
                           version; and observes, that his commentators illustrate "the word of Luther, not of God," in this place, p. 378. (Haydock)</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
