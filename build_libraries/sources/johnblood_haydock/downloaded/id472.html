                           ver. 6, 9. It was situated in the plains of Moab, near the Jordan, and was the last station of the Hebrews. (Calmet) --- In
                           this neighbourhood all the following transactions occurred, which are recorded, till the end of the Pentateuch. (Menochius)
                           --- Balaam, being convinced that the Hebrews would be invincible, as long as they continued faithful to God, advised the nations,
                           who had sent to consult him, to let their daughters converse freely with the Israelites, but not to yield to their impure
                           desires, unless they consented to offer sacrifice to their idols. (Calmet) --- Thus they first captivated their hearts, and
                           then subverted their understanding: For<EM> some rejecting a good conscience, have made shipwreck concerning the faith,</EM>
                           1 Timothy i. 19. (Haydock) --- By the same method many have been drawn into heresy. (Worthington) --- The counsels of an able
                           but wicked man, are often followed by the most dreadful effects. That these women were sent by the Moabites, and also by the
                           Madianites, (ver. 6, 17,) instigated by the perverse counsels of Balaam, (Calmet) appears not only from the event being recorded
                           in this place, but also by the express declaration of Moses, chap. xxxi. 7, 8, and of the Apocalypse, chap. ii. 14. (Salien,

                           as it were to him. (Challoner) --- Hebrew, "Israel was attached, <I>or</I> married to Beelphegor," the sun, Adonis or Osiris,
                           whom the psalmist (cv. 28,) styles, <I>the dead,</I> because the people were accustomed to bewail the death of Adonis every
                           year, with great solemnity. (Calmet) --- St. Jerome supposes this god "of opening, <I>or</I> nakedness," Beelphegor, to be
                           the obscene Priapus. (Menochius) --- The people fell by degrees into the depth of abomination. They first defiled their bodies
                           with women, then their souls were contaminated by the <I>sacrifices</I> of their idols, till they began really to <I>adore</I>

                           who were the princes or ringleaders, and who are sentenced to be gibbeted. (Salien) --- The mother of Asa, king of Juda, was
                           not ashamed to preside over the mysteries of this obscene idol, (3 Kings xv. 13,) which people worshipped by prostitution.

                           Assemble the judges, and by their sentence, hang them who have been most guilty. (Onkelos) --- If any of the judges, or princes

                           before his body was hung on a gibbet; and that crucifixion was not known among them. But the contrary is asserted by many.
                           It is not clear whether these criminals were hung by the neck, or crucified, after they had been first stoned, as guilty of
                           idolatry, or whether they were fastened to the gibbet alive, for greater torment and disgrace. (Calmet) --- <I>Sun;</I> publicly.

                           of the more noble were spared, so that Zambri, even became more insolent. God began to supply the defect of his ministers,

                           Septuagint, "introduced one of his brethren to a Madianite woman." But the Samaritan copy agrees with the Vulgate; and the
                           ancient edition of the Septuagint must have done so too, since the Fathers explain it in the same sense. (Philo, de vita Mos.;
                           Origen; &amp;c.) Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. 6,) pretends, that Zambri had married the most noble Cozbi, and that Moses finding
                           fault with such infractions of his laws, this prince of the house of Simeon, arraigned him publicly of cruel tyranny and imposture
                           in thus imposing his own laws upon a free people, and that for his part, he would retain his wife and ingratiate himself with
                           many gods, that he might discover <I>the truth.</I> Phinees heard this with just indignation, and following him to his tent,
                           transfixed him with Cozbi, his wife, while those young men who were desirous of imitating his zeal, treated similar offenders
                           in like manner. "God destroyed the rest by the plague, so that not less than 14,000 perished," as Epiphanius translates, omitting
                           <I>dis,</I> or ten thousand, though many copies have only 23,000, which agrees with the number specified by St. Paul, if indeed
                           he allude to this transaction, 1 Corinthians x. 7. Philo observes, that Phinees slew the Israelite who had sacrificed to the
                           idols, and was in the company of the harlot; and , "that 24,000 perished in one day." (Haydock) --- Perhaps 1000 of the heads
                           might be gibbeted, and 23,000 of the common people slain. (Du Hamel)</FONT></P><B>

                           A short interruption of 150 years (from Heli to Abiathar, of the race of Ithamar) may be accounted trifling in a duration
                           of so many ages, during which the posterity of Phinees enjoyed this dignity. Phinees succeeded Eleazar, and had for his successors,
                           Abiezer, Bocci, and Elsi. (Calmet) --- Some add Zararias, Meraioth, and Amarias, upon whose death, 1157 years before Christ,
                           Heli got possession, by some means, and was followed by Achitob, Achielech, and Abiathar, of the same family, till David joined
                           Sadoc with the latter, and he was acknowledged sole pontiff on the rebellion of Abiathar, B.C. 1014. See Lenglet's tables.
                           (Haydock) --- We have no proof that the succeeding high priests were of a different family, (Calmet) till our Saviour's time,
                           who re-united in his person the right both to the priesthood and to the kingdom of Israel <I>for ever.</I> See St. Augustine,
                           City of God xvii. 6. (Haydock) --- God did not promise that no interruption should take place. He only granted a perpetual
                           right to the family of Phinees, (Cajetan) which they might forfeit by their misconduct. (Tirinus) --- He was certainly always
                           disposed to comply with his promise, and really granted the effects of it to the posterity of Phinees, at least for almost
                           1000 years, even if we grant that the Machabees were not his lineal descendants, of which there is no positive proof either
                           way. Thus, <I>for ever,</I> often denotes a long duration. Though Phinees was entitled already to the high priesthood, in
                           quality of the eldest son of Eleazar, he had before no assurance of surviving him, nor of having a succession of children
                           who might be capable of the high office, and free from every blemish; (Calmet) so that the promise made to him, was not only
                           a ratification of his title, but a new and real benefit. (Haydock) --- <I>Zealous.</I> The Jews allow any person to kill one
                           who publicly, or in the presence of ten people, commits idolatry, sacrilege, fornication with a strange woman, and also a
                           priest who, being unclean, approaches to the altar. This they call <I>the judgment of zeal.</I> (Selden, Jur. iv. 4.; Grotius,
                           ii. 20.) This practice they authorize by the example of Phinees, Mathathias, &amp;c. (1 Machabees ii. 24.) Such liberty was
                           carried to a great excess by the Zealots, in the last siege of Jerusalem; and it would be very criminal, where such a law
                           is not in force. (Calmet) --- Phinees was, however, either one of the judges, and thus gave an example of just severity to
                           his fellow magistrates, or he was inspired by God to resent the public injury done to his name. It is never lawful to kill
                           by private authority. (Roman Catechism p. 3., chap. vi. 5.; St. Thomas Aquinas, ii. 2. q. 60. 6.) (Worthington) --- Those
                           who act under the influence of inspiration, must be very careful not to give in to any delusion; and the examples of holy
                           persons who are mentioned, with applause, in Scripture, for having been the instruments of God's vengeance, will not authorize
                           us to do the like, unless we can produce the like testimony. (Haydock) --- <I>Atonement,</I> by averting the scourge of God,
                           (ver. 8, 11,) and by putting a stop to the corruption of the people, which might otherwise have greatly increased, if Zambri
                           had escaped with impunity. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>
