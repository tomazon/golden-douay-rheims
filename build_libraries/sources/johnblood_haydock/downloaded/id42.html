                           After the fatigues of preaching and teaching, Jesus towards evening left the temple, as it is in the Greek, <I><U>eporeueto
                           apo tou ierou</U>,</I> and went towards Mount Olivet, where he was accustomed to spend his nights, as we learn from St. Luke,
                           chap. xxi. ver. 37. (Jansenius) --- <I>His disciples came to shew him the buildings,</I> not moved by curiosity, for they
                           had seen them frequently before, but by pity; because he had on a former occasion, and only just before in Jerusalem, threatened
                           the destruction of the temple and city, hoping that the splendour and magnificence of so fine a structure, consecrated to
                           God, might alter his determination, as St. Hilary&nbsp;observes. But the anger of God, provoked by sins, is not to be appeased
                           with stones and buildings. He therefore answered them: (Jansenius)</FONT></P><B>

                           --- <I>A stone upon a stone.</I> We need not look on this as an hyperbole. The temple burnt by the Romans, and afterwards
                           even ploughed up. See Gregory of Nazianzus, orat. ii. cont. Julianum; Theodoret, lib. iii. Histor. chap. xx. &amp;c. (Witham)
                           --- Julian the apostate, wishing to falsify the predictions of Daniel and of Jesus Christ, attempted to rebuild the temple.
                           For this purpose, he assembled the chief among the Jews, and asking them why they neglected the prescribed sacrifices, was
                           answered, that they could not offer any where else but in the temple of Jerusalem. Upon this he ordered them to repair to
                           Jerusalem, to rebuild their temple, and restore their ancient worship, promising them his concurrence in carrying on the work.
                           This filled the Jews with inexpressible joy. Hence flocking to Jerusalem, they began with scorn and triumph to insult over
                           the Christians. Contributions came in from all parts. The Jewish women stripped themselves of their most costly ornaments.
                           The emperor opened his treasures to furnish every thing necessary for the building. The most able workmen were convened from
                           all parts; persons of the greatest distinction were appointed to direct the work; and the emperor's friend, Alipius, was set
                           over the whole, with orders to carry on the work without ceasing, and to spare no expense. All materials were laid in to an
                           immense quantity. The Jews of both sexes bore a share in the labour; the women helping to dig the ground, and carry away the
                           rubbish in their aprons and gowns. It is even said that the Jews appointed some pick-axes, spades, and baskets, to be made
                           of silver, for the honour of the work. Till this time the foundations and some ruins of the walls had remained, as appears
                           from St. Cyril, in his catechism xv. n. 15, and Eusebius, Dem. Evang. lib. viii. p. 406. These ruins the Jews first demolished
                           with their own hands, thus concurring to the accomplishment of our Saviour's prediction. They next began to dig a new foundation,
                           in which many thousands were employed. But what they had thrown up in the day, was, by repeated earthquakes, the night following
                           cast back again into the trench. When Alipius the next day was earnestly pressing on the work, with the assistance of the
                           governor of the province, there issued, says Ammianus Marcellinus, such horrible balls of fire out of the earth near the foundations,
                           as to render the place inaccessible from time to time to the scorched workmen. And the victorious element continuing in this
                           manner obstinately bent, as it were, to drive them to a distance, Alipius, thought proper to abandon, though reluctantly,
                           the enterprise. This great event happened in the beginning of the year 363, and with many very astonishing circumstances is
                           recorded both by Jews and Christians. See the proofs and a much fuller account of this astonishing event, which all the ancient
                           fathers describe as indubitable, in Alban Butler's life of St. Cyril of Jerusalem, March 18th. Thus they so completely destroyed
                           whatever remained of the ancient temple, that there was not left one stone upon another; nor were they permitted by heaven
                           even to begin the new one. (Maldonatus)</FONT></P><B>

                           must take good notice with St. Jerome, that three questions are here joined together. 1. Concerning the destruction of Jerusalem;
                           2. of the coming of Christ; 3. of the end of the world. Christ's answers and predictions in this chapter, are to be expounded
                           with a reference to the three questions. This hath not been considered by those interpreters; who expound every thing here
                           spoken by Christ of the destruction of Jerusalem; nor by others, who will have all understood of his coming to judgment, and
                           of the end of the world. (Witham) --- It is probable the apostles themselves did not understand that they were asking about
                           two distinct events. Being filled with the idea of a temporal kingdom, they thought that Christ's second coming would take
                           place soon; and that Jerusalem, once destroyed, the Messias would begin his reign on earth.</FONT></P><B>

                           Jesus answering.</I> Various are the interpretations given here. Some will have it refer to the destruction of Jerusalem,
                           which took place, A.D. 70; and others, to the end of the world. That of St. Chrysostom seems to be very conformable to the
                           context, and is followed by many. He explains all, to the 23d verse exclusively, of what shall precede the destruction of
                           Jerusalem; nor is there any circumstance which cannot easily be referred to that event, as will appear from a careful and
                           attentive observation of the history of the Jews, and of the Church at that time, in the writings of Josephus and Eusebius.
                           Even the preaching of the gospel to the whole world, which seems to favour the contrary explanation, is by the same father
                           said to have taken place before the destruction of Jerusalem. St. Paul tells the Colossians, that even in his time the faith
                           was spread all over the world. The abomination of desolation may be explained of the Roman soldiery, or, of the seditious
                           zealots, who, by their murders and other atrocities, polluted the temple. See Josephus, b. 4. and 5. of the Jewish war. As
                           deicide was a crime peculiar to the Jews and exceeded every other crime, their punishment was severe above measure. Had the
                           Almighty punished them to the full of what they had deserved, not one of the Jews would have escaped. But as he formerly would
                           have spared Sodom and Gomorrha, had there been found therein ten just men to avert the impending ruin; so shall these days
                           of affliction be shortened for the sake of some who believe. The verses subsequent to the 22d, are explained by St. Chrysostom
                           of the second coming of Christ, previous to the general judgment. (Jansenius) --- Such as wish for a more particular explanation
                           of every thing preceding the 23d verse, how it applies to the Jews, may consult the concordance of Jansenius, who thus concludes
                           his observations: "Hitherto we have explained all things of the destruction of Jerusalem, which prophecies, though they principally
                           regarded the times of the apostles, may be of use to us in two ways. 1. It will confirm our faith, when we see clearly fulfilled
                           whatever was distinctly foretold of this people; and may serve to increase our fears, when we reflect, that what is immediately
                           added concerning the day of judgment, shall be fulfilled with the same rigorous exactitude and certainty. It is another effect
                           of divine Providence for the increase of our faith, that this prophecy, which was to take place with regard to Jerusalem,
                           is not mentioned by St. John, who lived long enough to see it accomplished, but by the other evangelists, who died long before
                           the event. 2. It should animate us in the practice of virtue, and gratitude to reflect, that whatever tribulations happen
                           to the Church, or throughout the earth, all co-operate to the advantage of the elect. Such as will be good, have nothing to
                           fear." (Jansenius)</FONT></P><B>

                           many will come.</I> One of these was Simon Magus, who in the Acts (chap. viii. ver. 10.) is mentioned as calling himself the
                           power of God; hence the apostle St. John (1 John ii. 18,) says, <I>and as you have heard that Antichrist cometh, even now
                           there are become many Antichrists.</I> By Antichrists I understand heretics, who, under the name of Christ, teach doctrines
                           different from Christ; neither is there any reason for us to be surprised, if many be seduced, since our Lord declares that
                           many will be seduced. (St. Jerome) ... This alone will be sufficient for us to know the false doctrines taught by Antichrist,
                           when they assure us that they are Christ; for we do not read in any part that Christ said so of himself. The miracles he performed,
                           the doctrines he taught, and the virtues he on every occasion exhibited, were proofs sufficient to convince us that he was
                           the Christ. There is need of the assistance of God to overcome the snares laid for us by hypocrisy. (Origen) --- Among these
                           impostors were one Theodas, (Acts v. 36,) the impious Egyptian, (Acts xxi. 38,) Judas of Galilee, Menander, and several others
                           who preceded the destruction of Jerusalem; but many more will precede the destruction of the world. This therefore is the
                           <I>first sign,</I> the seduction of many souls from the true faith by heresies, and is common to both events. (Jansenius)
                           --- See much more in Barradius, tom. iii. lib. 9, chap. 2, where he collects various illustrations from Josephus and profane
                           authors. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           and from the events; the latter, from what we learn from the Apocalypse, will certainly happen. (Menochius) --- These things

                           abomination of desolation</I> was first partly fulfilled by divers profanations of the temple, as when the image of Cæsar
                           was set up in the temple by Pilate, and Adrian's statue in the holy of holies, and when the sacrifices were taken away; but
                           will be more completely fulfilled by Antichrist and his precursors, when they shall attempt to abolish the holy sacrifice
                           of the mass. St. Hyppolitus, in his treatise <I>de Anti-Christo,</I> mentioned by Eusebius, St. Jerome, and Photius, thus
                           writeth: "The churches shall lament with great lamentations, because there shall neither be made oblations, nor incense, nor
                           worship grateful to God. ... In those days the liturgy (or mass) shall be neglected, the psalmody shall cease, the reciting
                           of Scripture shall not be heard." --- The prophet Daniel (xii. 11.) calculates the reign of Antichrist, <I>from the time that
                           the daily sacrifice shall be taken away;</I> which, by able commentators, is understood of the sacrifice of the mass, which
                           Antichrist will endeavour to suppress. --- <I>The abomination of desolation,</I>[2] or the abominable desolation. Instead
                           of these words, we read in St. Luke, (xxi. 20.) <I>When you shall see Jerusalem surrounded by an army.</I> Christ said both
                           the one and the other. But the words in St. Luke, seem rather to give us a sign of the ruin of Jerusalem, than of the end
                           of the world. --- <I>Spoken of by Daniel, the prophet.</I> The sense is, when you shall see that very prophecy of Daniel literally
                           fulfilled hereafter. What follows in the prophecy of Daniel, confirms this exposition; when the prophet adds, that the <I>desolation
                           shall continue to the end;</I> that the Jews from that time, shall be <I>no more the people of God, for denying their Messias;</I>
                           and that they shall <I>put the Christ to death.</I> But what then was this desolation, which by the following verse, was to
                           be a sign to the Christians to <I>fly out of Judea?</I> Some expound it of the heathen Roman army, approaching and investing
                           Jerusalem, called the <I>holy city.</I> Others understand the profanation of the temple, made by the Jews themselves, a little
                           before the siege under Vespasian; when the civil dissensions, those called the <I>Zealots,</I> had possessed themselves of
                           the temple, and placed their warlike engines upon the pinnacles; and a part, at least, of the temple was defiled with the
                           dead bodies of those killed there. It was at that time that the Christians, according to Christ's admonition, left Jerusalem
                           and Judea, and fled to Pella, beyond the river Jordan. See Eusebius, lib. iii. Hist. chap. v. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">Ver. 36.</FONT></B><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif"> <I>No
                           man knoweth ... but the Father alone.</I> The words in St. Mark (xiii. 32.) are still harder: <I>neither the angels, nor the
                           Son, but the Father.</I> The Arians objected this place, to shew that Christ being ignorant of the day of judgment, could
                           not be truly God. By the same words, <I>no one knoweth, but the Father alone,</I> (as they expound them) the Holy Ghost must
                           be excluded from being the true God. In answer to this difficulty, when it is said, <I>but the Father alone,</I> it is certain
                           that the eternal Son and the Holy Ghost could never be ignorant of the day of judgment: because, as they are one and the same
                           God, so they must have one and the same nature, the same substance, wisdom, knowledge, and all absolute perfections. 2. It
                           is also certain that Jesus Christ knew the day of judgment, and all things to come, by a knowledge which he could not but
                           have, because of the union by which his human nature was united to the divine person and nature. See Colossians ii. 3. And
                           so to attribute any ignorance to Christ, was the error of those heretics called <I>Agnoitai.</I> 3. But though Christ, as
                           a man, knew the day of judgment, yet this knowledge was not due to him <I>as he was man,</I> or <I>because he was man,</I>
                           but he only knew the day of judgment, because he was God as well as man. 4. It is the common answer of the fathers, that Christ
                           here speaks to his disciples, only as he was the ambassador of his Father; and so he is only to know what he is to make known
                           to men. He is said not to know, says St. Augustine[5], what he will not make others know, or what he will not reveal to them.
                           (Witham) --- By this Jesus Christ wished to suppress the curiosity of his disciples. In the same manner after his resurrection,
                           he answered the same question: <I>'Tis not for you to know the times and the moments, which the Father has placed in his own
                           power.</I> This last clause is added, that the apostles might not be discouraged and think their divine Master esteemed them
                           unworthy of knowing these things. Some Greek manuscripts add <I>nor even the Son,</I> as in Mark xiii. 32. The Son is ignorant
                           of it, not according to his divinity, nor even according to his humanity hypostatically united to his divinity, but according
                           to his humanity, considered as separate from his divinity. (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>

                           ver. 28,) <I>likewise as it was in the days of Lot; </I>they shall be eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and
                           building, i.e. totally immersed in worldly pursuits. Hence the apostle; <I>when they shall say peace,</I> viz. from past evils,
                           <I>and security,</I> viz. from future, <I>then shall destruction come upon them on a sudden.</I> But some one may ask, how
                           can there possibly be all this peace, all this security, when the evils mentioned above, famines, wars, plagues, earthquakes,
                           and particularly the darkness of the sun, &amp;c. &amp;c. are presages calculated to strike with panic and consternation minds
                           the most thoughtless and giddy? I answer, that the wicked are chiefly designed here, who in the midst of the afflictions and
                           alarms of the good, will still indulge in their pleasures and luxuries, like cruel soldiers, whilst the peaceable inhabitants
                           are plundered. St. Jerome adds, that the world for some time before its final dissolution, will be freed from all those calamities.
                           As to what is said (ver. 29,) of the darkness of the sun and moon, these are circumstances that refer to the very coming of
                           the judge. (Jansenius)</FONT></P><B>

                           strongly expresses how unexpectedly these evils will rush in upon mankind; and the subsequent account of the two women grinding
                           in the mill, shews how little they were solicitous for their salvation. We are, moreover, taught by these examples, that some

                           of worldly honour. The same is mentioned in Exodus, chap. xi, ver. 5. <I>From the first-born of Pharao, who sitteth on his

                           infamy of Christians be it said, much more diligence is used by the worldly wise for the preservation of their wealth, than
                           by the former for the salvation of their immortal souls. Though they are fully aware that the Lord will come, and like a thief
                           in the night, when they least expect him, they do not persevere watching, nor guard against the irreparable misfortune of

                           gained the whole world, which we must then leave, and lose our immortal souls, which, owing to our supine neglect to these
