                           <i>Ethanim</i> was afterwards called Tisri. (Haydock) --- Usher places the dedication on Friday, 30th October, the 8th of
                           the seventh month. The people continued at Jerusalem till the 23rd. The feast of expiation fell on the 10th, (Haydock) during
                           the octave of the dedication. After this, the feast of tabernacles commenced on the 15th, for other seven days. This was the
                           year of jubilee; and Solomon had waited on purpose, that the people might have more leisure to attend on such a solemn occasion.
                           (Calmet) --- But on this we cannot rely. There might be other reasons for the delay; (See chap. vi. 38.) and one of the chief
                           might be, a desire to perform this ceremony in the seventh or sabbatical month, which was honoured with more festivals than
                           any other. It had just elapsed, before the temple was finished, in the preceding year. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           They also (Haydock) brought the Mosaic tabernacle from Gaboan, (Calmet; Josephus, &amp;c.) and reposited both (Haydock) in

                           and the altar of incense, in order to prevent their falling into the hands of the Chaldeans. He placed them in a cave, where

                           wrote; which must have been before the captivity. Unless we thus distinguish the times, the Hebrew contains a palpable contradiction.
                           (Calmet) --- "They drew out (or lengthened) the staves, and the heads....were seen out in the holy place....and they were
                           not seen out." (Haydock) --- To a person standing at a small distance, they were not visible, though they rather touched the

                           --- These might have been in the ark while it was not fixed: but after the temple was built, all but the tables were placed
                           in the treasury; where, we find, the book of the law was discovered, under Joas, Deuteronomy xxxi. 26., and 2 Paralipomenon
                           xxxiv. 14. Others think that, in the days of St. Paul, the rod, &amp;c., might have been reposited in the ark, though they
                           had not been admitted at the time when this book was written. (Bellarmine, &amp;c.) --- But we have no assurance that the
                           ark was ever placed in the second temple; and Josephus informs us, that when the Romans destroyed the temple, "there was nothing
                           at all" in the sanctuary. (Calmet) --- <i>In area</i> might easily signify <i>ad,</i> or <i>juxta arcam,</i> "near the ark."

                           This luminous cloud filled the whole temple, to convince all that the Lord was pleased with the devotion of the king, and

                           his face turned towards the people, as he was also in the court of Israel. Then turning himself to the altar (Calmet) of holocausts,
                           (Menochius) with his hands uplifted, he began to pray, ver. 23, to 54. See Exodus xxxix. 43., and 2 Kings vi. 18., where Moses
                           and David blessed the people, on similar occasions. (Calmet) --- Thus the priests of the Catholic Church turn to the people,
                           when they bless or speak to them; and look towards the altar, when they pour forth their supplications for them to God. Sectaries

                           The Christian church generally adopts this custom. So did the pagans, (<i>Et genibus pronus, supplex, similisque roganti.;</i>
                           Metam. iii.) as they also stretched for their hands. <i>Sustulit exutas vinclis ad sidera palmas,</i> says Virgil. (Æneid
