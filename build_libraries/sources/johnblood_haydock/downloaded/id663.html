                           from crosses than from prosperity. The exemplary punishment of Saul's family was a lesson to kings, and to all mankind, to
                           teach them how they ought to observe justice and the sanctity of oaths. --- <i>Gabaonites;</i> probably after the slaughter

                           was a Hebrew name, and, with Swift in jest, maintain the high antiquity of our language. (Haydock) --- Regularly proper names
                           should be retained. (Calmet) --- But the learned have often chosen to give the import of foreign names, in the language in
                           which they have been writing. See Du Thou's History. Thus <i>Dubois</i> is styled Sylvius; Newman, Neander; &amp;c. --- <i>An
                           embroiderer.</i> Protestants make this a part of the man's name, "Jaare-oregim." Septuagint, "the son of Ariorgeim." In 1
                           Paralipomenon xx, no notice is taken of his profession. (Haydock) --- That passage will evince that <i>Elhanan</i> is not
                           the same with David, as some would infer from the mention of Goliath's death, but the son of Jair, uncle of Joab, (chap. xxxiii.
                           24.) who was born at Bethlehem, though the verse in Paralipomenon would insinuate less correctly, that the giant's name was
                           Lechem, thus, "Elehanan....slew Lechem, the brother," &amp;c., as the copyist had written <i>ath</i> instead of <i>bith.</i>
                           (Calmet) --- Our version has not this mistake: "Adeodatus, the son of Saltus, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath,
                           the Gethite," &amp;c., 1 Paralipomenon xx. 5. (Haydock) --- "It would be difficult to find a passage more disfigured than
                           the present; and, without the help of the Paralipomenon, it would be impossible to make it out." (Calmet) --- Kennicott makes
                           a similar remark. (Diss. i. and ii.) But he believes that the Book of Chronicles, though the latest, and usually the most
                           corrupt, of the Old Testament, is here perfectly correct; and that the passage before us is strangely corrupted, "Jaare Oregim,
                           a Bethlehemite," being placed instead of , ..."Jaor slew Lahmi," as he thinks that <i>oregim,</i> "weavers," has been inserted
                           from the line below, p. 79. Josephus ([Antiquities?] vii. 10.) relates this transaction as follows, "When the king had sent
                           a fresh army against them, Nephan, his relation, displayed the greatest valour. For engaging in a single combat with the bravest
                           man of the Philistines, and killing his antagonist, he caused the rest to turn their backs, and many of the enemy fell in
                           that battle." Thus he evades all the difficulty, adding much out of his own head; and by Nephan, designating <i>Elehanan,
                           the son of his </i>(Joab's) <i>uncle,</i> (chap. xxiii. 24.) or Dodo, a word which the Vulgate renders <i>patrui ejus,</i>
                           "his paternal uncle," though it hath a wider signification, and denotes other relations. Hence, as Joab was the nephew of
                           David, this brave man might be in the same degree, and born of one of the children of Isai; or, perhaps, Josephus infers that
                           he was a kinsman of David, because he was of the same city. (Haydock) --- <i>Goliath.</i> He might have the same name as his
                           brother, who had been slain by David forty-three years before; (Salien) or the title of <i>brother</i> may only signify, that
                           this giant resembled the former in size and strength, Proverbs xviii. 9. --- <i>Beam.</i> See 1 Kings xvii. 7. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                                    and David consulted the oracle of the Lord. And the Lord said: <i>It is</i> for Saul and his bloody house, because he slew

                                    were not of the children of Israel, but the remains of the Amorrhites: *and the children of Israel had sworn to them, and
                                    Saul sought to slay them out of zeal, as it were, for the children of Israel and Juda.)</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 David, therefore, said to the Gabaonites: What shall I do for you?

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 And the Gabaonites said to him: We have no contest about silver and
                                    gold, but against Saul, and against his house: neither do we desire, that any man be slain of Israel. And the king said to
                                    them: What will you, then, that I should do for you?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And they said to the king: The man that crushed us and oppressed us
                                    unjustly, we must destroy in such manner, that there be not so much as one left of his stock in all the coasts of Israel.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 Let seven men of his children be delivered unto us, that we may crucify
