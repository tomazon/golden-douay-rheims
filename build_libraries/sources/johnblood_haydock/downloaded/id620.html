                           in the form of a <I>lentil.</I> (Pliny, [Natural History?] xviii. 12.) --- <I>Oil.</I> This anointing seems to have been peculiar
                           to the kings, priests, and prophets of the Hebrews, who prefigured Jesus, the great anointed of God. (St. Augustine in Psalm
                           xliv.) The custom was very ancient, Judges ix. 8. It is thought that those kings, who succeeded their fathers by their birth-right,
                           and without opposition, did not receive any unction. (Calmet) --- But the silence of Scripture is no proof on this head; and
                           the Fathers seem to be convinced that the custom subsisted till Christ appeared. (St. Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho,
                           etc.) (Haydock) --- The Rabbins pretend that the sacred ointment was used for the kings of Juda, but not for those of Israel.
                           It is not probable that it was used for either, Exodus xxx. 32., and 3 Kings i. 39. We read that Jehu was anointed king of
                           Israel; (4 Kings ix. 6,) and we may suppose that common oil was used, in his regard, as well as for the other kings. The perfume
                           or balm of Judea, does not spot the garments on which it may fall. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xii. 25.) It was poured on the
                           head; the Rabbins say in the form of a crown, (Calmet) or cross. (Haydock) --- But this is uncertain. The ceremony has been
                           preserved, with respect to Christian kings, who, according to Innocent I, should be anointed on the shoulders and arms, while
                           prelates receive the unction on the head. --- <I>Kissed him,</I> out of respect, Psalm ii. 12. (Calmet) --- <I>Behold.</I>
                           Hebrew, "Is it not because?" &amp;c. (Haydock) --- <I>And thou....prince.</I> All this is wanting in the Hebrew, &amp;c. But
                           it is conformable to the Vatican Septuagint; (Calmet) the Alexandrian has "to be prince over his people, over Israel? and
                           thou shalt rule over the people of the Lord, and shalt save it from its enemies around;" as we have explained, chap. ix. 16.
                           (Haydock) --- Saul was anointed with <I>a small vessel,</I> to signify that his kingdom should not subsist long; and with
                           <I>oil,</I> to remind him of mercy, light, and health to his people. (St. Gregory) (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           were "dancing," as the Septuagint insinuate, and playing on musical instruments, like the prophets, ver. 5. It does not appear
                           how Saul would come near Bethlehem, in his journey from Ramatha to Gabaa, unless Ramatha lay more to the south than it is
                           represented, which it could not do, being in the tribe of Ephraim; so that we might translate the Hebrew, "Thou wilt find

                           were not molested by the infidels, in performing their devotions, as people consecrated to the Lord, who do not meddle with
                           war, are privileged by the consent of nations. (Grotius, Jur. iii. 11, 10) (Calmet) --- <I>Prophets.</I> These were men whose
                           office it was to sing hymns and praises to God; for such in holy writ are called <I>prophets,</I> and their singing praises
                           to God is called <I>prophesying.</I> See 1 Paralipomenon, alias 1 Chronicles xv. 22., and xxv. 1. Now there were in those
                           days colleges, or schools for training up these prophets; and it seems there was one of these schools at this <I>hill of God;</I>
                           and another at Naioth in Ramatha. See 1 Samuel [1 Kings] xix 20, 21, &amp;c. (Challoner) --- The Jews say there were in every
                           city of Judea congregations of this nature. They lived like monks, abstaining, for the most part, from marriage, though some
                           had children, 4 Kings iv. 1. They had a superior at their head, to whom God frequently revealed future things. The rest were
                           instructed how to explain the prophecies, to compose and sing canticles. Some of them were inspired, like Saul, only for a
                           time. It is supposed that Samuel instituted these colleges, and this is the first time we find them mentioned. (Calmet) ---
                           They were of infinite service in preserving the true religion. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           had obtained over the Ammonites, when he was confirmed in his dignity, chap. xi. 14. But the mention of seven days, seems
                           to indicate that Samuel is here speaking of that event, when the war against the Philistines was at hand, and Saul neglected
                           to wait the appointed term, before he ventured to offer sacrifice, chap. xiii. 8. (Calmet) --- Some think that Samuel engages
                           always to meet him at Galgal, on any important business, within the space of seven days. (Serarius) --- Others translate,
                           "I will be at Galgal with thee, and we will offer sacrifices, for seven days." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "I will come down
                           to thee to offer burnt-offerings," &amp;c., which is conformable to the Septuagint. Indeed Saul was probably blamed for offering

                           This proverb received a fresh confirmation, when Saul was going to seize David, and was forced by the Spirit to join with
