                           and crime, which involved a great part of the remainder of David's life in misery. (Haydock) --- He had reigned 18 years,

                           As they did not wear stockings, this practice was very common after a journey. David thus insinuated that Urias might take
                           his rest, and go to his wife, that so he might suppose that the child was his own, and the crime of Bethsabee might be concealed.

                           consequence. (Menochius) (Calmet) --- But, at any rate, the ark was covered with skins or veils, even in the tabernacle at

                           the king might desist from pressing him any farther. (Salien) --- But David resolves to endeavour to make him forget his oath,
                           during the moments of intoxication. The valour and temperance of Urias, and divine Providence, render all his craft useless;

                           of the fourth day, as Urias staid three nights at Jerusalem. It is not clear that he was intoxicated the last of them. On
                           that night David permitted him to act as he should think proper; and finding that he obstinately persisted in the resolution
                           of not going to sleep with his wife, he had recourse to the last and most barbarous expedient of making way for his own marriage
                           with the woman, as he saw this was the only method left for him to save her honour. The utmost expedition was requisition,
                           as many days must have elapsed before she perceived her situation; (Haydock) and if many more should pass over, it would be
                           manifest to the world that she had been guilty of adultery, and must either be stoned, or, if David spared her, he must bear
                           the blame. (Salien) --- <I>Urias.</I> The fable of Bellerophon being sent by Pr&#339;tus to Jobates, king of Syria, with a
                           letter, desiring the king to put the bearer to death, seems to have been copied from this history. Their letters have become

                           Hebrews write Jeroboseth, to avoid the mention of Baal, as they also do with respect to the name of Isboseth, who was probably

                           not that David had married the woman, but on account of his former conduct towards her and her husband. (Menochius) --- The
                           canon law forbids the marriages of those who have been accomplices in the death of their former partner; and some have thought
                           that this marriage of David was null. But this is inaccurate; and the fruits of it were (Calmet) all deeded legitimate. See
                           1 Paralipomenon iii. 5. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins even pretend that David was guilty of no sin in marrying Bethsabee during
                           the life-time of Urias; as the latter, they say, must have given her a bill of divorce when he went to war. (Grotius) ---
                           But why should we excuse an action which was so severely condemned and punished by God? (Chap. xii. 1., &amp;c., and Psalm
                           l.) (Calmet) --- In David's conduct, we here behold a complication of the basest passions of lust and cruelty; which make
                           David neglect the sanctity of an oath, (ver. 11) and attempt to ruin, by drunkenness, the soul of one to whom he was much
                           indebted; and, afterwards, to expose him to an untimely death, perhaps without repentance; if indeed Urias exceeded the bounds
                           of moderation. This however is not certain; as the word <I>drunk</I> is often used to denote a degree of blameless conviviality,
                           Genesis xliii. 34. Yet the design of David was equally criminal. How soon may the man <I>according to God's own heart,</I>
                           fall from his elevated station into the depth of the abyss! <I>Wherefore let him that thinketh himself to stand, take heed
                           lest he fall,</I> 1 Corinthians x. 12. (Haydock)</FONT></P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And David said to Urias: Go into thy house, and wash thy feet. And

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And it was told David by some that said: Urias went not to his house.

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And Urias said to David: The ark of God, and Israel and Juda dwell
                                    in tents, and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, abide upon the face of the earth: and shall I go into my house, to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 Then David said to Urias: Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And David called him to eat and to drink before him, and he made him

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And when the morning was come, David wrote a letter to Joab: and sent

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Writing in the letter: Set ye Urias in the front of the battle, where
                                    the fight is hottest: and leave ye him, that he may be wounded, and die.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 Wherefore, as Joab was besieging the city, he put Urias in the place
                                    where he knew the bravest men were.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And the men coming out of the city, fought against Joab, and there
                                    fell some of the people of the servants of David, and Urias, the Hethite, was killed also.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Then Joab sent, and told David all things concerning the battle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And he charged the messenger, saying: When thou hast told all the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 If thou see him to be angry, and he shall say: Why did you approach
                                    so near to the wall to fight? knew you not that many darts are thrown from above, off the wall?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 Who killed Abimelech, the son of Jerobaal? *did not a woman cast a
                                    piece of a mill-stone upon him from the wall, and slew him in Thebes? Why did you go near the wall? Thou shalt say: Thy servant
                                    Urias, the Hethite, is also slain.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 So the messenger departed, and came and told David all that Joab had

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And the messenger said to David: The men prevailed against us, and
                                    they came out to us into the field: and we vigorously charged and pursued them, even to the gate of the city.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And the archers shot their arrows at thy servants, from off the wall
                                    above: and some of the king's servants are slain, and thy servant Urias, the Hethite, is also dead.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And David said to the messenger: Thus shalt thou say to Joab: Let
                                    not this thing discourage thee, for various is the event of war: and sometimes one, sometimes another, is consumed by the
                                    sword: encourage thy warriors against the city, and exhort them, that thou mayst overthrow it.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And the wife of Urias heard that Urias, her husband, was dead, and
                                    she mourned for him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And the mourning being over, David sent and brought her into his house,
                                    and she became his wife, and she bore him a son: and this thing which David had done, was displeasing to the Lord.</font></p>
