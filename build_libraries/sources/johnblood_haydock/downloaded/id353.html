                                    might have lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us a great sin. And he commanded all the people, saying:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 He that shall touch this man's wife, shall surely be put to death.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found that same year a hundred-fold:
                                    and the Lord blessed him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And the man was enriched, and he went on prospering and increasing,
                                    till he became exceeding great.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And he had possessions of sheep and of herds, and a very great family.
                                    Wherefore the Palestines envying him,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Stopped up at that time all the wells, that the servants of his father,
                                    Abraham, had digged, filling them up with earth:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to Isaac: Depart from us, for
                                    thou art become much mightier than we.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 So he departed, and came to the torrent of Gerara, to dwell there:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And he digged again other wells, which the servants of his father,
                                    Abraham, had digged, and which, after his death, the Philistines had of old stopped up: and he called them by the same names,
                                    by which his father before had called them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And they digged in the torrent, and found living water:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against the herdsmen
                                    of Isaac, saying: It is our water. Wherefore he called the name of the well, on occasion of that which had happened, Calumny.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And they digged also another; and for that they quarrelled likewise,
                                    and he called the name of it, Enmity.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 Going forward from thence, he digged another well, for which they
                                    contended not; therefore he called the name thereof, Latitude, saying: Now hath the Lord given us room, and made us to increase
                                    upon the earth.*</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And he went up from that place to Bersabee,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 Where the Lord appeared to him that same night, saying: I am the God
                                    of Abraham thy father, do not fear, for I am with thee: I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's
                                    sake.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And he built there an altar: and called upon the name of the Lord,
                                    and pitched his tent; and commanded his servants to dig a well.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 To which place when Abimelech, and Ochozath his friend, and Phicol
                                    chief captain of his soldiers, came from Gerara,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 Isaac said to them: Why are ye come to me, a man whom you hate, and
                                    have thrust out from you?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And they answered: We saw that the Lord is with thee, and therefore
                                    we said: Let there be an oath between us, and let us make a covenant,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 That thou do us no harm, as we on our part have touched nothing of
                                    thine, nor have done any thing to hurt thee; but with peace have sent thee away, increased with the blessing of the Lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And he made them a feast, and after they had eaten and drunk:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 Arising in the morning, they swore one to another: and Isaac sent
                                    them away peaceably to their own home.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 And behold, the same day the servants of Isaac came, telling him of
                                    a well which they had digged, and saying: We have found water.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 Whereupon he called it Abundance: and the name of the city was called
