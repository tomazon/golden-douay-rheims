                           <I>The Pharisees and Sadducees.</I> These were widely opposite in their religious sentiments to each other, but closely united
                           in their design of persecuting Jesus Christ, and they come and ask of him a sign or prodigy from heaven, to convince them
                           that he was the Christ, the Messias. (Bible de Vence) --- The Sadducees deny the immortality of the soul, and affirm that
                           our only obligation is the observance of the law; insomuch, that they prided themselves on their right of disputing the most
                           important points with their teachers. This sect is not numerous, and chiefly composed of men of condition, who, when properly
                           qualified for offices of state, are compelled to conform, at least in appearance, to the principles of the Pharisees; otherwise,
                           they would incur the resentment of the Pharisees. (Josephus, Book xviii. chap. ii.) See also note on ver. 7, chap. iii, above.
                           --- St. Chrysostom is of opinion he would have granted them any sign they wished, had they been willing to believe; but as
                           their object was curiosity and censure, he refused to comply. They mistrusted, it would seem, his other miracles as the effect
                           of some occult quality inherent in him, and wished to see a miracle performed upon distant objects in the heavens or clouds,
                           which would be to them less suspicious and objectionable. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           know then how to discern the face of the sky,</I> &amp;c. Jesus Christ does not condemn every observation made upon the weather,
                           from external appearances in the heavens. He only upbraids the Jews for so closely examining these signs, and neglecting at
                           the same time to notice the many signs and predictions which so plainly manifested him to be the promised Messias. (Denis
                           the Carthusian) --- The reasoning of Jesus Christ is this: you know how to judge of the weather from observation, and cannot
                           you then know the certain signs so often promised, and now completed in my coming? The signs of this event were, the taking
                           away the sceptre from the tribe of Juda. (Genesis xxxix.[xlix.?] 10.) The completion of the 70 weeks of years of <I>Daniel</I>
                           ix. 25, amounting to 490 years, which were now on the eve of being completed. The miracles of Jesus Christ, as the curing
                           of the blind, the lame, the deaf and dumb, foretold by Isaias xxxv. 5. and lxi. 1. To which may be added the apparition of
                           angels to the shepherds at Bethlehem, the miraculous star which appeared to the magi, the testimony of his heavenly Father,
                           the descent of the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove. Besides, the testimony of the Baptist, and so many miracles of every
                           kind wrought to establish this truth, most certainly, clearly, and infallibly demonstrate, that the long expected Messias
                           had already come, and that this Jesus was the Messias. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           the ship; or, according to others, had distributed all among the poor. (Barrardius) --- They were so taken with the company
                           of Christ, that they even forgot the necessities of life. (St. Anselm) --- The disciples, ever constant attendants on our
                           Redeemer, were retained so strongly by the love of his company, that they would not be absent from him for one moment. We
                           may also remark how far they were from an eager search after delicacies, when they even forgot the daily pittance requisite
                           for their support. (St. Remigius) --- It was the custom of those times, and that country, for persons on a journey to carry

                           situated on the Mediterranean: and not in this, but in the former, did Christ interrogate his disciples. He first withdrew
                           them from the Jews, that they might with more boldness and freedom deliver their sentiments. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lv.) ---
                           The Cæsarea here mentioned continued to be called by heathen writers Panea, from the adjoining spring Paneum, or Panium, which

                           sanctified in his mother's womb; or, on account of his great charity and love for his brethren, as it was written of Jeremias:

                           they will overturn also the Church that rests upon it. Christ therefore here promises to Peter, that he and his successors
                           should be to the end, as long as the Church should last, its supreme pastors and princes. (Tirinus) --- In the Syriac tongue,
                           which is that which Jesus Christ spoke, there is no difference of genders, as there is in Latin, between petra, a rock, and
                           Petrus, Peter; hence, in the original language, the allusion was both more natural and more simple. (Bible de Vence) --- <I>Thou
                           art Peter;</I>[2]<I> and upon this</I> (i.e. <I>upon thee,</I> according to the literal and general exposition of the ancient
                           Fathers) <I>I will build my church.</I> It is true St. Augustine, in one or two places, thus expounds these words, <I>and
                           upon this rock, </I>(i.e. upon myself:) or upon <I>this rock, which Peter hath confessed:</I> yet he owns that he had also
                           given the other interpretation, by which Peter himself was the rock. Some Fathers have also expounded it,<I> upon the faith,</I>
                           which Peter confessed; but then they take not faith, as separated from the person of Peter, but on Peter, as holding the true
                           faith. No one questions but that Christ himself is the great foundation-stone, the chief <I>corner-stone,</I> as St. Paul
                           tells the Ephesians; (Chap. ii, ver. 20.) but it is also certain, that all the apostles may be called foundation-stones of
                           the Church, as represented Apocalypse xxi. 14. In the mean time, St. Peter (called therefore <I>Cephas,</I> a rock) was the
                           first and chief foundation-stone among the apostles, on whom Christ promised to build his Church. (Witham) --- <I>Thou art
                           Peter,</I> &amp;c. As St. Peter, by divine revelation, here made a solemn profession of his faith of the divinity of Christ,
                           so in recompense of this faith and profession, our Lord here declares to him the dignity to which he is pleased to raise him:
                           viz. that he, to whom he had already given the name of Peter, signifying a <I>rock,</I> (John i. 42.) should be a <I>rock</I>
                           indeed, of invincible strength, for the support of the building of the church; in which building he should be next to Christ
                           himself, the chief foundation-stone, in quality of chief pastor, ruler, and governor; and should have accordingly all fulness
                           of ecclesiastical power, signified by the keys of the kingdom of heaven. --- <I>Upon this rock,</I> &amp;c. The words of Christ
                           to Peter, spoken in the vulgar language of the Jews, which our Lord made use of, were the same as if he had said in English,
                           <I>Thou art a rock, and upon this rock I will build my church.</I> So that, by the plain course of the words, Peter is here
                           declared to be the rock, upon which the church was to be built; Christ himself being both the principal foundation and founder
                           of the same. Where also note, that Christ by building his house, that is, his Church, upon a rock, has thereby secured it
                           against all storms and floods, like the wise builder. (Matthew vii. 24, 25.) --- <I>The gates of hell,</I> &amp;c. That is,
                           the powers of darkness, and whatever Satan can do, either by himself or his agents. For as the Church is here likened to a
                           house, or fortress, built on a rock; so the adverse powers are likened to a contrary house or fortress,&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
                           size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">the gates of which, i.e. the whole strength, and all the efforts it can make, will
                           never be able to prevail over the city or Church of Christ. By this promise we are fully assured, that neither idolatry, heresy,
                           nor any pernicious error whatsoever shall at any time prevail over the Church of Christ. (Challoner) --- <I>The gates,</I>
                           in the Oriental style, signify the powers; thus, to this day, we designate the Ottoman or Turkish empire by the <I>Ottoman
                           port.</I> The princes were wont to hold their courts at the gates of the city. (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>

                           I will give to thee the keys,</I> &amp;c. This is another metaphor, expressing the supreme power and prerogative of the prince
                           of the apostles. The keys of a city, or of its gates, are presented or given to the person that hath the chief power. We also
                           own a power of the keys, given to the other apostles, but with a subordination to St. Peter and to his successor, as head
                           of the Catholic Church. --- <I>And whatsoever thou shalt bind,</I> &amp;c. All the apostles, and their successors, partake
                           also of this power of <I>binding</I> and <I>loosing,</I> but with a due subordination to one head invested with the supreme
                           power. (Witham) --- <I>Loose on earth.</I> The loosing the bands of temporal punishments due to sins, is called an indulgence:
                           the power of which is here granted. (Challoner) --- Although Peter and his successors are mortal, they are nevertheless endowed
                           with heavenly power, says St. Chrysostom, nor is the sentence of life and death passed by Peter to be attempted to be reversed,
                           but what he declares is to be considered a divine answer from heaven, and what he decrees, a decree of God himself.<I> He
                           that heareth you, heareth me,</I> &amp;c. The power of binding is exercised, 1st. by refusing to absolve; 2nd. by enjoining
                           penance for sins forgiven; 3nd. by excommunication, suspension or interdict; 4th. by making rules and laws for the government
                           of the Church; 5th. by determining what is of faith by the judgments and definitions of the Church. (Tirinus) --- The terms
                           <I>binding</I> and <I>loosing,</I> are equivalent to <I>opening</I> and <I>shutting,</I> because formerly the Jews opened
                           the fastenings of their doors by untying it, and they shut or secured their doors by tying or binding it. (Bible de Vence)
                           --- Dr. Whitby, a learned Protestant divine, thus expounds this and the preceding verse: "As a suitable return to thy confession,
                           I say also to thee, that thou art by name Peter, i.e. a rock; and <I>upon thee, who art this rock,</I> I will build my Church,
                           and I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, <EM>the power of </EM></FONT><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif"><EM>making
                           laws</EM><I> to govern my Church.</I>" (Tom. i, p. 143.) Dr. Hammond, another Protestant divine, explains it in the same manner.
                           And p. 92, he says: " What is here meant by the keys, is best understand by Isaias xxii. 22, where they signify ruling the
                           whole family or house of the king: and this being by Christ accommodated to the Church, denotes the power of governing it."</FONT></P><B>

                           no one that he was Jesus, the Christ.</I> In some manuscripts both Greek and Latin, the name Jesus is not here found, and
                           many interpreters think it superfluous in this place. The Greek expressly says the Christ adjoining the article, which the
                           Latin tongue does not express. (Bible de Vence) --- "In a preceding part of Scripture, Jesus sending his apostles, commanded
                           them to publish his coming; but here he seems to give a contrary mandate, <I>tell no one,</I> &amp;c. but in my opinion it
                           is one thing to preach the Christ, and another to preach Christ Jesus; for Christ is a name of dignity, but Jesus is the particular
                           name of the Redeemer." (St. Jerome) --- He did not forbid them to teach that there was a Messias a Redeemer, but to declare
                           then that he was the person; 2nd. the disciples (Matthew x,) are not sent to preach the gospel, strictly speaking, but only
                           to prepare the minds and hearts of the people for the coming of the Messias, as is evident from Matthew x. 23. See Mark xiv.
                           61. and 62; John v. 18. and viii. 58. and x. 30. and xi. 27. But why did he lay this injunction? To avoid the envy of the
                           Scribes, and not to appear to raise his own glory. He wished the people to be induced to own him for their Messias, not from
                           the testimony of his retainers, but from his miracles and doctrines; and lastly, because as his time was not yet come, the
                           apostles were not yet fit to deliver, nor the people to receive, this grand tenet. (Mat. Polus.) --- It might moreover have
                           proved a hinderance to his death.</FONT></P><B>

                           the glory of Jesus, against the redemption of mankind, and against the destruction of the devil's kingdom. He did not understand
                           that there was nothing more glorious than to make of one's life a sacrifice to God. (Bible de Vence) --- <I>Thou dost not,</I>

                           This conclusion, however, is not true, because, as St. Augustine and theologians affirm, Peter could fall into error in points
                           regarding morals and facts, though not in defining or deciding on points of faith. Moreover, St. Peter was not, as St. Jerome
                           says, appointed the pillar of the Church till after Christ's resurrection. (Tirinus) --- And it was not till the night before
                           Christ suffered that he said to Peter: <I>Behold, Satan hath desired to have thee; but I have prayed for thee, that "<B>thy
