                           and that Jesus understanding their secret thoughts, that they wished to have some grounds of accusation against him, placed
                           the sick man in the midst of them, and said what St. Mark here relates of him: <I>Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath-day,

                           great was the zeal of St. James, that he incurred the resentment of king Agrippa, and was the first of the apostles to seal
                           the doctrines of Jesus Christ with his blood. St. John also fulfilled the import of his name, as appears from his gospel,
                           epistles, apocalypse, and the sufferings he underwent at Rome for the faith. Sts. Peter, James, and John, were the only apostles
