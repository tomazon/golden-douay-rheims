                           which the faithful made of selling their property, and laying the price at the feet of the apostles, implied a vow of reserving
                           nothing for themselves, but giving all to the community; and that the crime of Ananias and Saphira consisted in the violation
                           of this vow; on which account they regarded them as sacrilegious, and plunderers of sacred things. See St. Basil, Serm. i.
                           de instit. Monac.; St. Cyprian, lib. i. ad Quir. &amp;c. --- For, without this supposition, we cannot, as Menochius justly
                           remarks, account for the sudden and severe punishment inflicted on the offending parties.</FONT></FONT></P><B>

                           what they had to sell. When they had sold the field, they resolved by mutual consent to keep for their private use part of
                           the money, and to bring in the rest, as if they had received no more. The whole price being promised, and by that means consecrated
                           to God, St. Augustine calls it a <I>sacrilegious fraud,</I> and St. Chrysostom, <I>a theft</I> of what was already made sacred
                           to God. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           also; for he had also lied to Peter, and the other apostles. (Menochius) --- "If it displeased God," says St. Augustine, "to
                           withdraw part of the money they had vowed to God, how is he angry, when chastity is vowed and not performed! ... let not such
                           persons think to be condemned to corporal death, but to everlasting fire." (Serm. x. de diversis.) --- St. Gregory, on this
                           same subject, says: "Ananias had vowed money to God, which afterwards, overcome by diabolical persuasion, he withdrew; but
                           with what death he was punished, thou knowest. See, then, what judgment thou art to expect, for withdrawing, not money, but
                           thyself, from Almighty God." (lib. i. ep. 33.)</FONT></P><B>

                           ... fell down and gave up the ghost.</I> St. Augustine says,[3] this severe judgment was to strike a terror of such dissembling
                           fraudulent dealings into the new Church. It was also to shew that St. Peter, and the apostles, had the gift of prophecy. (Witham)
                           --- Origen thinks his death was occasioned by the sudden fright and shame, with which he was seized. Pliny relates a similar
                           accident in the sudden death of Diodorus Dialecticus, lib. vii. cap. 53. --- Menochius and Cornelius a Lapide think, that
                           God struck him interiorly, as Peter spoke. ... There are likewise different opinions among the Fathers, respecting the salvation
                           of Ananias and Saphira. Some are of opinion, that as their fault was great, they died, and perished in their sin. but the
                           ideas we are fond to cherish of the infinite mercy of God, would rather incline us to say, with St. Augustine, "I can believe
                           that God spared them after this life, for his mercy is great. ... They were stricken with the scourge of death, that they
                           might not be subject to eternal punishment." (St. Augustine, Serm. cxlviii. olim. 10. et in Parmen.) --- St. Benedict also,
                           in the 57th chapter of his rule, insinuates, that their death was only corporal. (Haydock) --- It is not unreasonable, that
                           the first violators of laws, should be punished with severity. It was thus that the Almighty treated Adam, the adorers of
                           the golden calf, the first who broke the sabbath-day, &amp;c. to prevent the effects of bad example. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           had foretold, (John xiv. 12.) that his disciples should do even greater miracles than he had done. (Witham) --- St. Ambrose
                           compares with these miracles wrought by St. Peter's shadow, those which the linen cloths, that had touched the relics of the
                           holy martyrs, also wrought. (Epis. liv.) Si inanis quædam species vacuæ imaginis habere potuit in se vim salutis, quanto plus
                           de corpore meruerunt attrahere salubritatis sacris impressa membris vincula passionis? If the empty appearance of an unsubstantial
                           shadow possessed the power of giving health, how much more efficacy must the chains of the martyrs have drawn from the holy
                           members, which they bound? --- In appendice operum. (St. Augustine, serm. cciii.) --- St Augustine, speaking of the miracle
                           performed by the saints now reigning in heaven, says: "If the shadow of Peter's body could afford help, how much more now
                           the fulness of his power? And if then a certain little wind of him, passing by, did profit them that humbly asked, how much
                           more the grace of him, now being permanent and remaining?" (Serm. xxxix. de sanctis.)</FONT></P><B>

                           a tumult, but desired them to go along with them to the sanhedrim. (Witham) --- <I>Without violence.</I> They persuaded them
                           to appear willingly before the sanhedrim, thinking, perhaps, moreover, that they could not bind them, whom the walls of the
                           prison could not confine. The apostles here, and on all other occasions, shew the most astonishing examples of patience, constancy,
                           and obedience to the laws of the country. (Menochius) --- O Jews! who do you shut your eyes against the light? why so blindly

                           He that had been St. Paul's master, according to St. Chrysostom, advised them to forbear, and do nothing rashly. [Ver. 38.]
                           <I>Meddle not with these men;</I> literally, <I>go from them.</I>[6] For, saith he, if this be the <I>work of men</I> only,
                           it will soon fall to nothing; but if it be from God, you cannot hinder it, and you will only make yourselves guilty, by resisting
                           the designs of God. They <I>consented to him,</I> so far as not to put them to death; but they made them be <I>scourged,</I>
                           which they <I>rejoiced at;</I> and they dismissed them with reiterated <I>threats.</I> (Witham) --- Gamaliel was the master
                           of St. Paul, Barnabas, Stephen, and others, and favoured the Christians. St. Clement and Ven. Bede think he was then a Christian,
                           but concealed his conversion at the instigation of the apostles, that he might have an opportunity of defending Christ in
                           the council. He afterwards professed his faith publicly, and was canonized with is son Abibas. See Baronius, 3d of Aug. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 But one in the council rising up, a Pharisee, by name Gamaliel, a

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 After this man rose up Judas, of Galilee, in the days of the enrolling,
