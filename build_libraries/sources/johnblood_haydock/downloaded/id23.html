                           The cure of the paralytic (ver. 2), is generally supposed to have been anterior in point of time, to the cure of two possessed
                           persons, chap. viii. Carrieres supposes the contrary. (Bible de Vence) --- <I>Into his own city.</I> Not of Bethlehem, where
                           he was born, nor of Nazareth, where he was brought up, but of Capharnaum, says St. Chrysostom, where he is said to have dwelt
                           since he began to preach. See Matthew iv. 13. (Witham) --- St. Jerome understands this city to be Nazareth, which was Christ's
                           own, because he was conceived there. St. Augustine, St. Chrysostom, Euthymius, Theophylactus, think it was Capharnaum, because
                           this miracle was performed at the last mentioned place, according to St. Mark's relation; and St. Matthew calls it Christ's
                           own city, because after leaving Nazareth, he chose Capharnaum for the chief place of his abode. If St. Jerome's interpretation
                           be admitted, we must suppose that St. Matthew having told us that Christ came to his own city, Nazareth, and omitting to relate
                           what happened there, passed immediately to the history of the cure of the paralytic, which took place at Capharnaum. Such
                           omissions and change of place without the reader's being informed of the transition, are not unfrequent in the evangelists.
                           We must likewise observe that they frequently invert the order of facts, as to the time of their happening. (Jansenius) ---
                           Christ may be said to have had three cities: <I>Bethlehem,</I> in which he was born; <I>Nazareth,</I> in which he was educated;
                           and <I>Capharnaum,</I> in which he most frequently resided, during his sacred ministry. It is most probable, and most generally
                           understood, that in this place of the Scripture Capharnaum is meant; though several understand it of Nazareth, and some few
                           with Sedulius, lib. 3. carm.</FONT></P>

                           sins are forgiven thee.</I> We do not find that the sick man asked this; but it was the much greater benefit, and which every
                           one ought to prefer before the health of the body. (Witham) --- He says this, because he wished to declare the cause of the
                           disease, and to remove it, before he removed the disease itself. He might also desire to shew the paralytic, what he ought
                           to have prayed for in the first place. (Menochius) --- The sick man begs for corporal health, but Christ first restores to
                           him the health of his soul, for two reasons: 1st. That be might insinuate to the beholders, that the principal intent of his
                           coming into the world was to cure the evils of the soul, and to let them know that the spiritual cure ought most to be desired
                           and petitioned for. Corporal infirmities, as we learn in many places of the sacred text, are only the consequences of the
                           sins of the patient. In St. John (chap. iii.[chap. v.? ver.&nbsp;14.?]), Christ bids the man whom he had healed, to sin no
                           more, lest something worse should befall him; and St. Paul says, that many of the Corinthians were afflicted with various
                           diseases, and with death, on account of their unworthily receiving the body of the Lord. A second reason why Christ forgave
                           the sick man his sins, was, that he might take occasion from the murmurs of the Pharisees, to speak more plainly of his power
                           and divinity, which he proved not only by restoring the man instantaneously to health, but by another miracle equally great
                           and conclusive, which consisted in seeing the thoughts they had never expressed; for the evangelist observes, that they murmured
                           in their hearts. He afterwards cures the sick man to shew, says he, that the Son of man has power to forgive sins. (Jansenius)
                           --- We may here observe likewise, that when Christ afterwards gave his apostles their mission, and empowered them to preach
                           to the whole world, he communicates this same power to them, and seems to refer to the miracles which he had wrought, to prove
                           that he himself had the power which he gave to them. All power, says he, is given to me in heaven and on earth. As the Father
                           sent me, so I send you. ... Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven. (Haydock) --- <I>Seeing their faith.</I> It does
                           not follow from hence, as Calvin would have it, that faith alone will save us. For St. Chrysostom says, "Faith indeed is a
                           great and salutary thing, and without it there is no gaining salvation." But this will not of itself suffice without good
                           works; for St. Paul admonishes us, who have made ourselves deserving a participation of the mysteries of Christ, thus, (Hebrews
                           chap. iv.) "Let us hasten, therefore, to enter into that rest." He tells us to hasten, that is, faith alone will not suffice,
                           but we must also strive all our life by good works to render ourselves worthy to enter the kingdom of heaven: for if those
                           Israelites, who murmured and would not bear the calamities of the desert, were not, on that account, permitted to enter the
                           land of promise, how can we think ourselves worthy of the kingdom of heaven, (figured by the land of promise) if we will not
                           in this world undergo the labours of good works. (St. Chrysostom) --- From hence St. Ambrose concludes, that our Saviour is
                           moved to grant our petitions through the invocation of saints, as he even forgave this man his sins through the faith of those
                           that brought him. Of how much greater efficacy then will not the prayers of the saints be? (Barardius.) --- Christ does not
                           always require faith in the sick who desire to be cured, but seems to have dispensed with it on many occasions; for example,
                           in the cases of those he cured possessed by the devil. (St. Chrysostom) --- <I>Son,</I> &amp;c. O the wonderful humility of
                           the God-man! Jesus looks with complacence on this miserable wretch, whom the Jewish priests disdain to look upon, and in the
                           midst of all his miseries calls him his son. (St. Aquinas) --- They had read what Isaias had said: I am, I am he who destroyeth
                           thy sins: ego sum, ego sum ipse, qui deleo iniquitates tuas, xliii. 25.: but they had not read, or, at least they had not
                           understood what the same prophet says, liii. 6. The Lord hath heaped upon him the iniquity of us all: posuit Dominus in eo
                           iniquitatem omnium nostrum. Nor had they remembered the testimony of the Baptist: behold the Lamb of God, behold him who taketh
                           away the sins of the world. (John i. 29.) (Maldonatus)</FONT></P><B>

                           man blasphemeth,</I> by pretending to have a power to forgive sins, which none but God can do; and they looked upon Jesus
                           as a man only. It is true, and what all Catholics teach, that <I>God alone</I> hath power <I>of himself</I> to forgive sins.
                           But Christ, who was both God and man, could, and did communicate this power of forgiving sins <I>in his name,</I> to bishops
                           and priests, as <I>his ministers and instruments</I> in the sacraments of baptism and penance. We have Christ's clear words
                           for it, (John xx. 23.) <I>whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them,</I> &amp;c. (Witham) --- <I>And behold some
                           of the scribes.</I> The Jewish rulers wished to defame the character of our divine Redeemer, but by this means they rendered
                           the miracle much more famous, and Christ turned their wicked designs to their own confusion. (St. Chrysostom) --- For Christ
                           says, Why do you think evil in your hearts? in which words Jesus plainly evinces to them the reality of his divinity; for
                           who knows the secrets of man's heart, but God alone? (St. Jerome)</FONT></P><B>

                           seeing their thoughts.</I> By shewing that he knew their hidden thoughts, as well as by healing the man, to confirm his words
                           and doctrine, he gave them a proof of his divine power. (Witham) --- Not because they betrayed them by any exterior sign,
                           but, as St. Mark says, knowing in his spirit that they so thought within themselves, because he was God, in whose hands are
                           our hearts, (Proverbs chap. xv. and chap. xxi,) and to whose eyes all things are naked and open. (Tostatus.) --- Had not our
                           Saviour been truly God, and equal to his Father, he would have rebuked the scribes, for attributing that to God only which
                           he exercised. But so far from denying their assertion, he immediately admits the truth of it, and answers them by another
                           no less wonderful act of his almighty power. He tells them publicly the evil they had thought in their hearts, whilst the
                           Scriptures repeatedly affirm that God alone can know the secrets of hearts. <I>Thou alone knowest the hearts of the children
                           of men,</I> 3 Kings, chap. viii. and 2 Paralipomenon chap. vi ver. 30. <I>And man seeth those things that appear, but the
                           Lord beholdeth the heart.</I> And 1 Kings, chap. xvi, ver. 7, <I>The searcher of reins and hearts is God.</I> Psalm vii, ver.
                           10, <I>The heart is perverse above all things, and unsearchable. Who can know it? I am the Lord that search the heart and
                           prove the reins.</I> (Jeremias, chap. xvii, ver. 9. and 10.); and innumerable other texts of Scripture might be brought to
                           prove that God only can know the minds and thoughts of men. Our Saviour, therefore, shews himself to be equal to his Father,
                           by thus revealing to all, the malicious murmurs of his enemies, who for fear of the multitude, dared not to publish themselves
                           what their wicked hearts devised. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxx.) --- <I>Said: Why do you think,</I> &amp;c. Here St. Cyril exclaims,
                           Oh! thou Pharisee, who sayest, who is able to forgive sins, except God alone! I will answer thee; who is able to search into
                           the secrets of the heart but God alone, who calls himself, by his prophet, the searcher of the hearts and the reins of men!
                           (St. Cyril) --- If thou art incredulous about my power of remitting sin, behold I exercise another, whilst I lay open thy

                           of baptism and penance. (Haydock) --- <I>Which is easier.</I> It is more difficult to remit sins than restore the health of
                           the body. St. Augustine remarks, (tract. lxxii in Joannem) it is more difficult to justify a man than to create the heavens
                           and the earth; but Christ speaks thus, because the Pharisees might otherwise have said, that as he could not confer visible
                           health upon the body, he had recourse to the invisible remission of sins, and that it was easy to grant in words, what no
                           one could discern whether it was really granted or not. In this sense, therefore, the word, "Be thou healed," is more difficult
                           than simply to say, "Thy sins are forgiven thee;" which any one could say, though he might not effect what his word implied.
                           (Menochius) --- Doubtless the healing of the body was easier, for as much as the soul is more excellent than the body, so
                           much is the healing of the soul more difficult and more excellent than that of the body. But since the one is visible, the
                           other invisible, therefore he performs the less, but more evident miracle, in testimony of the performance of the other more
                           excellent, but less evident exertion of his power. Thus he truly verifies what the Baptist said of him, "This is he that taketh
                           away the sins of the world." (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxx.)</FONT></P><B>

                           to the people to whom he wrote his gospel. (St. Thomas Aquinas) --- Thus Christ proves that he had the power of remitting
                           sins; as a falsity cannot be confirmed by a miracle, since in this case God would bear testimony to a falsity. (Menochius)

                           and body. (Haydock) --- <I>Surge, tolle,</I> and <I>vade,</I> Christ added these words for the greater evidence of the cure.

                           Matthew.</I> 'Tis remarked by St. Jerome, that the other evangelist, out of respect to this apostle, did not call him Matthew,
                           (the name he generally went by) but Levi; whereas he, in his own gospel, to shew the goodness of God who from a publican had
                           made him an apostle, styles himself Matthew the publican. (St. Thomas Aquinas) --- (St. Augustine, de Concor. Evan.) It is
                           most probable, says St. Augustine, that St. Matthew does not mention what had happened to him, before he began to follow Jesus;
                           for it is supposed that this evangelist was called antecedent to the sermon on the mount; for St. Luke named the 12 that were
                           chosen, and calls them apostles. St. Matthew mentions his vocation to the apostleship as one of the miracles that Jesus performed,
                           for certainly it was a great miracle for a publican to become an apostle. --- <I>Rose up, and followed him.</I> When we hear
                           the voice of God calling us to virtue, we must not delay. The devil, says St. Basil, does not advise us to turn entirely from
                           God, but only to put off our conversion to a future time. He steals away our present time, and gives us hopes of the future.
                           But when that comes, he steals that also in the same manner; and thus by giving us present pleasure, he robs us of our whole
                           life. (St. Basil) --- <I>Sitting in the custom-house.</I> Jesus called St. Matthew with two words only, <I>follow me;</I>
                           and presently he left all, and became his disciple; doubtless by a particular inspiration and motion of divine grace. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           have sinned, and need the glory of God.</I> (Romans iii.) (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxi.) --- Christ came to call all men, both
                           just and unjust, since he called Nathanael, who was a just man. But the meaning of these words is, I came not to call you,
                           Scribes and Pharisees, who esteem yourselves just, and despise others, and who think you have no need of a physician; but
                           I came to call those who acknowledge themselves sinners. (Theophylactus) --- Or the meaning may be, "I came not to call the
                           just to penance, of which they have no need;" thus in St. Luke, (chap. v.) <I>I came not to call the just, but sinners to
                           repentance.</I> Or again, the meaning may be, I came not to call the just, because there are none just of themselves, and
                           who stand not in need of my coming. St. Paul says, <I>All have sinned,</I> as above. (Menochius) --- <I>Mercy, and not sacrifice.</I>
                           Christ here prefers mercy to sacrifice; for, as St. Ambrose says, there is no virtue so becoming a Christian as mercy, but
                           chiefly mercy to the poor. For if we give money to the poor, we at the same time give him life: if we clothe the naked, we
                           adorn our souls with the robe of justice: if we receive the poor harbourless under our roof, we shall at the same time make
                           friends with the saints in heaven, and shall afterwards be received by them into their eternal habitations. (St. Ambrose)
                           --- I will have mercy and not sacrifice: these words occur in the prophet Osee, chap. vi. The Pharisees thought they were
                           making a great sacrifice, and acceptable to God, by breaking off all commerce with sinners; but God prefers the mercy of the
                           charitable physician, who frequents the company of sinners; but merely to cure them. (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>

                           joined with the disciples of the Baptist, and thus is reconciled what we read in St. Luke v. 33, who only mentions the Pharisees.
                           (Bible de Vence) --- <I>Why do we, and the Pharisees fast.</I> It is not without reason that the disciples of St. John should
                           ask this question, fasting being always esteemed a great virtue, witness Moses and Elias; the fasts which Samuel made the
                           people observe in Masphat, the tears, prayers, and fasting of Ezechias, of Judith, of Achab, of the Ninivites, of Anna, the
                           wife of Eleana, of Daniel, of David, after he had fallen into the sin of adultery. Aaron, and the other priests, also fasted
                           before they entered into the temple. Witness also the fasts of Anna, the prophetess, of St. John the Baptist, of Christ himself,
                           of Cornelius the centurion, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. (St. Jerome) --- This haughty interrogation of St. John's disciples was
                           highly blameable, not only for uniting with the Pharisees, whom they knew their master so much condemned, but also for calumniating
                           him, who, they knew was foretold by John's own testimony. (St. Jerome) --- St. Augustine is likewise of opinion, that John's
                           disciples were not the only persons that said this, since St. Mark rather indicates that it was spoken by others. (St. Thomas

                           Jesus strictly charged them.</I> Although our Saviour strictly charged them to keep the miracle silent, they nevertheless
                           published it throughout all that country; not being able to contain themselves, they became the evangelists and publishers
                           of what they were commanded to conceal. Thus we are admonished not only to keep silent ourselves whatever is to our own commendation,
                           but likewise to endeavour to hinder others from publishing it; to act otherwise would be to render ourselves odious to men,
                           and abominable in the sight of God. But if we are silent, we shall obtain greater glory in the sight both of God and men.
                           On the other hand, whatever redounds to the glory of the Almighty, we must ourselves publish, and exhort others to make it
                           known to the whole world. Therefore it is said, <I>Go and relate the glory of God.</I> (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxiii.)</FONT></P><B>
