                           Job (xxxi. 26, 28) takes notice of the adoration of the sun and of the moon, and calls it <I>a very great iniquity, and a

                           Israelites. (Haydock) --- The pagans looked upon the sun and moon as the king and queen of heaven, and the stars as their
                           guards. Plato says (in Phædro) that "the sun marches at the head of the gods, in a winged chariot, and the eleven other gods

                           xv. 35,) and St. Stephen out of the city of Jerusalem, Acts vii. 57. When only a few were concerned, the twenty-three judges
                           passed sentence: but if a whole tribe had been guilty, the cognizance of the affair was left to the Sanhedrim. When a city
                           was infected with this abomination, it was wholly destroyed. But no one was punished, except two witnesses (ver. 6,) attested
                           that formal idolatry, by sacrifice, &amp;c., had been committed. (Selden, Syned. iii. 4.)</FONT></P><B>

                           to prove any crime; neither would the Jews receive for witnesses, women, infants under thirteen, slaves, publicans, thieves,
                           &amp;c. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] iv. last chapter.) The Rabbins also reject other notorious offenders, enemies, relations,
                           and those who had not a competent knowledge of the law, &amp;c. (Ap. Selden, Syn. ii. 13. 11.; and Grotius) --- But we could

                           was stoned by the other, and by the whole people. Maimonides asserts, that the execution took place on some great festival,

                           deciding, without appeal, all controversies relating to the law; promising that they should not err therein; and punishing
                           with death such as proudly refused to obey their decisions: and surely he has not done less for the church-guides of the New
                           Testament. (Challoner) --- <I>Hard.</I> Hebrew also means, "doubtful, hidden, divided;" so that the opinions of the judges
                           do not agree. In matters of fact, the thing is more easily investigated on the spot. But in these cases, where the law is
                           ambiguous, as even the divine ordinances frequently are, being delivered in human language, (Grotius) a living judge is necessary.
                           God remits the Jews in the council of the priests, at the head of whom was the sovereign pontiff, who was the natural and
                           supreme judge of such difficulties, ver. 9, 12. (Haydock) --- <I>And blood,</I> to decide when murder must be punished with
                           death, and when the right of an asylum may be claimed. (Calmet) --- The Vulgate renders the same words, 2 Paralipomenon xix.
                           10. --- <I>Between kindred and kindred,</I> as the different degrees cause many embarrassments, with regard to marriages,
                           &amp;c. (Tirinus) --- The Rabbins understand that the judge had to declare when a woman was rendered unclean, Leviticus xii.
                           4. (Lyranus) --- <I>And cause,</I> or lawsuit; some thinking that a greater sum for reparation of an injury should be required,
                           others judging that one of the contending parties should be set at liberty, while the other judges are of a contrary sentiment.
                           Hebrew, "between judgment and judgment," when a doubt arises whether laymen or the Levites may be the proper judges. The Rabbins
                           only remit three cases to the tribunal of the latter, respecting, <B>1.</B> The red heifer; <B>2.</B> the woman accused of
                           adultery by her jealous husband; <B>3.</B> the heifer to be offered in sacrifice, for a murder committed by a person unknown,
                           chap. xxi. 5. --- <I>And leprosy.</I> Various difficulties might arise concerning this matter, of which the priests had to
                           pass sentence, Leviticus xiii. Some render the Hebrew <I>negah,</I> "wound." The law of retaliation required a scrupulous
                           nicety. <I>Blood, cause, and leprosy,</I> may denote lawsuits of a criminal, less important, and ceremonial nature. (Jansenius)

                           Moses does not specify whether the contending parties, or the judges themselves thought proper to have the matter debated
                           before a higher court. The Rabbins observe, that appeals to the Sanhedrim were only the last resort, and that the sentence
                           of that tribunal was to be complied with under pain of death, ver. 12. (Selden, Syned. iii. 2. 2.) The judge here mentioned,
                           according to them and the generality of commentators, after Josephus, Philo, &amp;c., is no other than the high priest, as
                           the Scripture plainly indicates, chap. xxi. 5., and Ezechiel xliv. 24. He abode near the tabernacle, and God enabled him to
                           explain the law, when he was arrayed with the ephod, and the Urim and Thummim. Some moderns, who have an interest to lessen
                           the authority of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, with Calvin, Ainsworth, &amp;c., pretend that an appeal was to be made to
                           the priests, in disputes which concerned religion, and to the civil magistrate in other cases, 2 Paralipomenon xix. 5. (Calmet)
                           --- But an appeal to the high priest, in doubtful cases, could not be denied. The government of the Jews was a theocracy,
                           and the pontiff acted as the vicegerent of God. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           &amp;c. This law was to be the rule of the priests, in passing sentence. It was not left to the judgment of individuals to
                           comply or not, according as they might explain the law for themselves. Such a proceeding would be nugatory, as they would
                           thus be themselves the ultimate judges of their own cause. (Haydock) --- <I>They shall seek the law at his</I> (the priest's)
                           <I>mouth,</I> Malachias ii. 7. Protestants make, therefore, a very frivolous restriction, when they allow his sentence to
                           bind only "so long as he is the true minister of God, and pronounceth according to his word." (Bible, 1603.) (Worthington)
                           --- If any had been proud enough among the Jews, to persuade himself that he understood the law better than the high priest,
                           he would not on that account have escaped death. (Haydock) --- The authority of the Christian Church is not inferior to that
                           of the Synagogue, only, "instead of death, excommunication is now inflicted" on the rebellious. (St. Gregory, Matthew xviii.
                           17.; St. Augustine, q. 38.) In effect, St. Paul assures us that the priests of the law, <I>serve unto the example and shadow
                           of heavenly things. But now he </I>(Christ)<I>...is the mediator of the better covenant, which is established on better promises,</I>
                           Hebrews viii. 5, 6. If therefore the privilege of deciding points of faith and morality, without danger of mistake, was granted
                           to the synagogue, can any one doubt but that Christ would provide as ample a security for his Church, with which he has promised
                           to <I>remain for ever,</I> and with his <I>Holy Spirit </I>to <I>teach</I> her <I>all</I> the <I>truth</I>? (Haydock) ---
                           St. Augustine dwells upon this argument (Doct. 4.) and proves the infallibility both of the Jewish and of the Christian Church.
                           Hence Christ said, with respect to the former, which was not yet rejected, <I>All therefore whatsoever they shall say to you,
                           observe and do: but according to their works, do ye not: for they say </I>the truth, <I>and do not</I> practise what they
                           require of others. If the heads of the Catholic Church should be equally immoral, their true doctrine must not therefore be
                           despised, lest Christ and his Father be at the same time <I>despised.</I> For this is the express admonition of our heavenly
                           lawgiver, <I>hear the Church:</I> (Matthew xvii. 17,) and this he does not require without giving us a full assurance, that
                           we may do it without fear of being led astray. The sole command of God implies as much, if he had said no more. For can he
                           order us to sin? The pretended reformers, who blushed not to make this blasphemous assertion, might easily swallow down the
                           other, respecting the defection and fallibility of the whole Church; and might even believe, that the <I>whole world had been
                           drowned in abominable idolatry for eight hundred years and more.</I> (Hom. on the peril of idolat. p. 3.) How much <I>more</I>
                           they do not determine, lest they should be forced to tell when the religion of the Catholics began, and that they will never
                           do without dating from Christ and the apostles, the foundations of the only true Church. (Haydock) --- The Jews had such a
                           respect for the decisions of their Rabbins, in consequence of this command of God, that some hesitate not to assert, that
                           if one of them should declare that the left hand was the right, they would believe him; and they condemn the refractory to
                           most grievous torments in hell. (Buxtorf., Syn. i.) --- We must shew the most profound submission to the decrees of the Church.
                           (Calmet) --- Yet we are not bound to assent to the decisions of every teacher. Only, when the Church speaks, we must not refuse
                           to obey, nor pretend to appoint ourselves judges of what she teaches. A private doctor, however eminent, may fall into some
                           absurdities, but the major part of the pastors of the Church, with the Pope at their head, never can. In vain have the records
                           of nineteen centuries been ransacked, to find a single instance of such a general agreement in error. If the Synagogue passed
                           a wicked sentence upon Jesus Christ, we must reflect that the forms here required (ver. 8,) were neglected; and it was then
                           <I>expiring,</I> and giving place to a <I>better covenant,</I> as the prophets had foretold. Yet even in that sentence, which
                           was so unjust on the part of Caiphas, St. John (xi. 51.) acknowledges the truth of God. <I>And this he spoke not of himself:
                           but being the high priest, that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation, and not only for the nation, but
                           to gather together in one the children of God that were dispersed.</I> The Synagogue could claim submission no longer, after
                           the great prophet had come to abrogate the law of fear, and to substitute that of love. Hence while he was there to teach
                           himself, (Hebrews i. 2,) there was no danger of deception for the people. But the covenant which he has established is to
                           last for ever: no prophet or lawgiver is promised to introduce any change, or greater perfection, so that no one can plead
                           for an excuse of his rebellion, that the Church may deceive and pass an erroneous judgment; or, if he do, he must be cut off
                           from the society of the faithful, by the spiritual sword; and, dying in that state, without the Church for his mother, he
                           need never expect that God will acknowledge him for his son. See St. Cyprian, Unity of the Catholic Church. If an individual
                           pastor should pass such a perverse sentence, the case would be very different. Yet, even in such trying cases, an humble conduct
                           will be the best security and proof of innocence, and God will reward those who have suffered unjustly. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Josue and David rendered the captured horses useless, (Josue xi. 6., and 2 Kings viii. 4,) and the judges rode on asses, Judges
                           x. 4., and xii. 14. Solomon began to keep some, and in his days Egypt was noted for the traffic of horses; though, after Sesostris
                           had intersected the country with canals, they were more neglected. (Marsham, Canon. sæc. xiii., and xiv.) God did not wish
                           his people to engage in the tumults of war, nor would he permit their king to be puffed up with his own strength, Psalm xix.

                           and to many other kings, whom Moses seems to have had in view. Too great a number of wives would tend to perplex and enervate
                           the king, and to eat up the treasures of his people. The Jewish lawyers allow the king only 18, and they say David and Roboam
                           had that number. But the latter had moreover 60 concubines, (2 Paralipomenon xi. 21,) and Solomon had many more. In effect,
                           the number seems not to be restricted, and, what is very singular, the Rabbins allow all but the high priest and the king
                           as many as they can keep, though the sages advise people to have no more than four, which seems to be the sentiment of the
                           Mahometans. This liberty was taken by the Jews till the emperors restricted them, A.D. 593. (Selden, Uxor. i. 8, &amp;c.)

                           on heavy taxes, alienated the hearts of his people, and gave occasion to the revolt of 10 tribes; and Ezechias brought on

                           an abridgment of the law, (Josue viii. 32.; Menochius) or even the five books, which were formerly written without any division,
                           and went under the name of the law. (Grotius; &amp;c.) --- Hebrew seems favourable to this last opinion, (Calmet) "he shall
                           write a copy of this law in a book, out of that which is kept by the priests," unless Moses might only require that he should
                           have a copy of what he was then delivering. (Haydock) --- Some say that the king was obliged to take two copies, one of which
                           he was to have always about him. It is not certain whether he was obliged to write himself, as Philo asserts, or another might
                           do it for him. The diadem and the law were presented to Joas, when he ascended the throne, 2 Paralipomenon xxiii. 11. (Calmet)
                           --- If (Haydock) Josias had not seen a copy of the law before the 18th year of his reign, this precept must have been very
                           ill observed, 4 Kings xxii. 11. (Calmet) --- But, very probably, that book, which Helcias discovered in the temple, was the
                           autograph of Moses, and therefore made a deeper impression upon all who saw and heard it read, than if it had been read than
                           if it had been only an ordinary copy. This copy might have been mislaid or secreted in those troublesome times; and then the
                           high priest brought it to light again, he as well as the king and all the people, were filled with joy and amazement. (Haydock)
                           --- It was the custom of the Jews to present a copy of the law to their kings, when they first sat upon the throne; and hence,
                           perhaps, they make a similar present to the Pope, when he goes to take possession of the Lateran church. (Morus.) --- They
                           presented one to Innocent II when he made his entry into Paris, 1146, and another to king Louis the Fat, as Suger informs
                           us. (Calmet) --- <I>Priests.</I> Temporal princes who desire to become virtuous and wise, will ever take the law of God at

                           Pious Christian emperors and kings have esteemed it their greatest glory and happiness to read and meditate on the holy commandments
