                           only in the Vulgate edition." (Haydock) --- Josephus produces this edict at length, but with some variations, (Calmet) which
                           are of no importance. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           is desired by all men, may be renewed." How amiable are these dispositions, which ought to be cherished by all princes! We
                           might then hope soon to see peace restored. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           names; (Capellus) but he intimates that Aman would do it, in whom he placed the most unbounded confidence. (Haydock) --- If
                           the latter had any suspicions of the queen's being of that nation, he might very prudently abstain from mentioning the Jews
                           even to the king, contenting himself with describing them so that they would easily be known by his agents; and, in effect,
                           the king sufficiently pointed out the Jews, by saying that they followed laws different from all the world. (Houbigant) ---
                           Infidels generally represent them as a wicked race, enemies to all but their own nation. (Tacitus, &amp;c.) --- We need not
                           wonder if Catholics be painted in the same colours, as the devil is still the same. (Haydock) --- <i>Fourteenth.</i> Josephus
                           has the same day, though the 13th is specified in Hebrew, &amp;c., (chap. iii. 12.) and in the Greek and Vulgate, chap. xvi.
                           20. We must, therefore, allow that the Jews might be slaughtered on both days, or that the Greek is incorrect in this place.
                           (Calmet) --- Salien thinks it would not be lawful to spare the Jews any longer than the 14th day; (Menochius) or the carnage
                           was to cease on the 14th, as it did at Susa, chap. ix. 17, 19. (Tirinus)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Hell.</i> Protestants, "grave." The king only wanted to send them out of this world. At the end of this verse, St. Jerome
                           says, "Hitherto <i>is given</i> the copy of the epistle. I found what follows after that place where we read, <i>So Mardochai,
                           &amp;c.,</i> (chap. iv. 17.) yet it is not in Hebrew nor does it appear in any of the interpreters." (Haydock) --- He means,
                           Aquila, &amp;c. For he plainly asserts before, that it was in the Septuagint, which he calls the Vulgate; and all know that
                           this version was taken from the Hebrew. The Church reads this prayer of Mardochai, (Tirinus) in the mass, against pagans,
                           (Worthington) and 21st Sunday after Pentecost, &amp;c., so that this is a part of Scripture which the Council of Trent will
                           not suffer to be rejected. (Tirinus)</font></p><b>

                           <i>To a man;</i> "as if," says Capellus, "the salutation and civil honour be not quite different from adoration or religious
                           worship, which must be given to God alone. Neither did Haman demand religious adoration, but only salutation and civil honour....<i>To
                           bend the knee</i> is frequently used in civil honour, nor is it necessarily understood of religious worship." May our English
                           Protestants deign to borrow this grain of common sense from one of their foreign brethren, when they attempt to impugn the
                           respect given by Catholics to the saints. (Haydock) --- "We grant that Aman did not require religious worship: but as the
                           civil respect which he claimed, was to be performed in the same manner as the Jews worshipped God, Mardochai would not wound
                           his own conscience, or that of his people." (Houbigant) --- Yet it is by no means clear that Aman did not insist on being
                           worshipped as a god. It is evident that Mardochai understood him, at least, in that light, chap. iii. 2. (Haydock)</font></p><b>
