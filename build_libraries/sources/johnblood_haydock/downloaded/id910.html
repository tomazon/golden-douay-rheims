                           What cruelties are occasioned by ambition! (Worthington) --- This is one of the most extraordinary proofs recorded in history.
                           Agrippina was but a faint copy of the unnatural Athalia, (Calmet) who knew that she was destined for slaughter, if she should
                           fall into the hands of Jehu. (Menochius) --- Her impiety might also prompt her to destroy all the posterity of David, that
                           she might introduce the worship of idols more easily. (Theodoret)</FONT></P><B>

                           She had probably a different mother, as she consented to the death of Athalia. (Calmet) --- But the crimes of the latter required
                           such a punishment; and even a daughter would have done wrong to screen her. (Haydock) --- Josabeth, as she is called in 2
                           Paralipomenon xxii. 11., was married to Joiada the high priest, <I>ibid.</I>[2 Paralipomenon xxii. 11.] --- <I>Out of.</I>
                           Hebrew and Paralipomenon, "hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bed-chamber" of the priest, in the temple; (Salien) different
                           from that bed-chamber in which he had hitherto been nursed. Thus the passage may be reconciled. (Menochius) (Calmet) --- Some
                           maintain that Joas was not the son of Ochozias, in whom the line of Solomon ended, but a descendant of David by Nathan. But
                           he is always styled the king's son, and the authority of the false Philo of Annius is of no weight. (Calmet) --- Joiada is
                           called <I>Barachias,</I> "blessed of the Lord," on account of his justice, (St. Jerome) in Matthew xxiii.</FONT></P><B>

                           six years, by usurpation. Women were commonly excluded, and she was not of the race of David, 4 Kings viii. 26. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           --- Joiada was a man of great authority, virtue, and discretion; so that he was able to manage this delicate affair, and no
                           one gave information to Athalia, as she was detested. The Levites and principal men of Juda were admonished, underhand, to
                           be present on the day appointed. The quality of high priest, and the known probity and zeal for the public good, which were
                           conspicuous in Joiada, as well as his being so nearly related to the lawful heir to the crown, made the people readily come

                           On this day the Levites replaced each other; so that many might assemble without suspicion. They guarded the king's apartments

                           (Menochius) or designed to contain the ashes, &amp;c., taken from the temple; (Villalpand ii. 32.) or a tribune for the king
