                           God claimed the first-born, on account of having spared them, Exodus xii. 23. He requires that all the males shall be redeemed,
                           except those of the tribe of Levi, whom he claims as his peculiar portion, as the price of the redemption of those who were
                           living in Egypt, when the destroying angel passed by. This honour was wholly gratuitous, though the Levites deserved to obtain
                           a confirmation of it by their zeal, Exodus xxxii. 29 and Deuteronomy xxxiii. 9. God seems to have revealed to Moses the destination
                           of Aaron's family, long before they were appointed to exercise the functions of the priesthood, Exodus xix. 22, 24, and xxiv.

                           The Gersonites had the care of the veils round the court, and of the cords and gates. The priests guarded the tabernacle,
                           ver. 32. The sons of Caath carried the altars, (ver. 31,) and the Merarites took care of the cords, which were attached to
                           the pillars of the court, ver. 37. Hebrew may be translated "(among the vessels of) the tabernacle, the covering thereof,

                           as dubious. (Kennicott) --- <I>Thousand.</I> If we collect the different sums, we shall find other 300; so that the Levites
                           would be 27 more than the first-born of the other tribes, though Moses says (ver. 43-46) that they were fewer by 273. Some
                           say that the 28th verse has been corrupted, (Calmet) or the 22nd, where we read 500 instead of 200. (Haydock) --- Others observe,
                           that in the 22,000, the first-born of the Levites and the priests of Aaron's family are not included, and these might amount
                           to 300 men. (Lyranus) --- But Bonfrere rightly observes that this number is too small, as only one is allowed for 74 people.
                           He thinks that the first-born, who were heads of families, are omitted, and those also who were born before the angel destroyed
                           the Egyptians. On this supposition, however, 22,000 will appear too great a number to be produced by the Levites in the space
                           of a year, when some were too young, and others too old, to have children, and others had children already before that event.
                           We may, therefore, either admit the solution of Lyranus, or confess that some fault has crept into the number, though this
                           must be very difficult, since Moses argues in the sequel on the supposition of its certainty. (Calmet) --- St. Jerome hence
                           infers, that these numbers are full of mystery; Origen (hom. 4,) says, that the exact number, 22,000, may signify the perfection
                           which God requires from those whom he takes into his service, as there are just 22 Hebrew letters, and 22 patriarchs, from
                           Adam to Jacob, the father of the Israelites. (Worthington) --- The 22,000 might be accepted by God, instead of so many Israelites;
                           and the 300 other Levites might be due to him on their own account, being the first-born since the Hebrews left Egypt. (Tirinus)

                           who had been vowed, Leviticus xxvii. 6. The money was to be paid either by those who were counted last, or by a tax laid upon
                           all the people, or it was determined by lot who should pay it. The Scripture is silent on this head. (Calmet)</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
