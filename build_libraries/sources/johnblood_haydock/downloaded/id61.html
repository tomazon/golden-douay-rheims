                           really different. The pasch is used for the 14th day of the moon of the first month. But the 15th day, on which they departed
                           out of Egypt, was the feast of the azymes, or the unleavened bread; which continued seven days, till the 21st day of the moon
                           inclusive. (Ven. Bede) --- <I>Pasch</I> is also used for the sabbath day within the seven days of the solemnity; (John xix.
                           14.) and also for all the sacrifices made during the seven days of the feast.</FONT></P><B>

                           body of Christ; and he himself says, <I>The bread, which I will give you, is my flesh.</I> (St. John vi.) But the flesh of
                           Christ is not seen, on account of our infirmity; for if we were allowed to see with our eyes the flesh and blood of Jesus,
                           we should not dare to approach the blessed sacrament. Our Lord therefore condescending to our weakness, preserves the outward
                           species of bread and wine, but changes the bread and wine into the reality of flesh and blood. (Theophylactus) --- St. Chrysostom,
                           in his thirtieth sermon on the treason of Judas, says: "Christ is also now present to adorn our table, (altar) the same that
                           was present to adorn that table. For it is not man that causes the elements to become the body and blood of Christ, but the
                           very Christ, the same that was crucified for us:&nbsp;<I><U>oude gar anthropos estin o[?] koion ta prokeimena ginesthai soma

                           words, but the power and grace is of God. He says, this is my body, and the word changes the elements: and as the sentence
                           'increase and multiply, and fill the earth, was spoken once, but still imparts fecundity to human nature throughout all time:
                           so these words (of consecration) once spoken, constitute an absolute, perfect sacrifice upon every altar of the Church from
                           that day to this, yea even to the time when Christ shall come again at the last day."&nbsp;<I><U>Schema pleron esteken o iereus,

                           Their force and import will however appear in a still stronger light, if we consider the formal promise Christ had made to
                           his apostles, as related by St. John, that he would give them his flesh to eat, that same flesh he was to deliver up for the
                           life of the world. He on that occasion confirmed with remarkable emphasis of expression the reality of this manducation, assuring
                           them <I>that his flesh was meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed;</I> and when some of the disciples were shocked at such
                           a proposal, he still insisted that unless they eat his flesh, they should have no life in them. The possibility of it he evinced
                           from his divine power, to be exemplified in his miraculous ascension; the necessity of it he established, by permitting those
                           to abandon him who refused to believe it; and the belief of it he enforced on the minds of his disciples, from the consideration
                           that he, their teacher, was the Son of God, and the author of their eternal salvation. The apostles were deeply impressed
                           with these thoughts, previously to the institution of the holy Eucharist; consequently when they beheld Jesus Christ, just
                           before his death, taking bread into his sacred hands; when after blessing it with solemnity, they heard him say, <I>Take,
                           eat; this is my body, which shall be given for you;</I> they must necessarily have concluded, that it was truly his body,
                           which he now gave them to eat, according to his former promise. And though their reason or senses might have started difficulties,
                           yet all these were obviated by their belief of his being God, and consequently able to effect whatever he pleased, and to
                           make good whatever he said. ------ Moreover, if we consult tradition, we shall find that the Greek, as well as the Latin Church,
                           has uniformly declared in favour of the literal sense of Christ's words, as may be seen at large in all Catholic controvertists.
                           The learned author of the Perpetuite de la Foi, and his continuator, Renaudot, in the two additional quarto volumes, have
                           invincibly demonstrated, that the belief of all the Oriental Christians perfectly coincides with that of the Catholic Church,
                           respecting the real presence. Dr. Philip Nicolai, though a Protestant, candidly acknowledges, in his first book of the Kingdom
                           of Christ, p. 22, "that not only the churches of the Greeks, but also the Russians, the Georgians, the Armenians, the Judæans,
                           and the Ethiopians, as many of them as believe in Christ, hold the true and real presence of the body and blood of our Lord."
                           This general agreement amongst the many Churches of the Christian world, affords the strongest evidence against Secker and
                           others, who pretend that the doctrine of the real presence is a mere innovation; which was not started till 700 years after
                           Christ's death. For, how will their supposition accord with the belief of the Nestorians and Eutychians, who were separated
                           from the Church of Rome long before that period, and who were found to agree exactly with Catholics concerning this important
                           tenent? --- <I>See this point</I> clearly given in Rutter's Evangelical Harmony.</FONT></P><B>

                           bring themselves to believe that there is nothing more designed, or given, than a memorial of Christ's passion and death?
                           Catholics, who believe in the real presence, do certainly renew in themselves the remembrance of our Saviour's death and passion,
                           with more lively sentiments of devotion than they who believe it to be mere bread and wine. The outward forms of bread and
                           wine, which remain in the Eucharist, are chiefly designed to signify or represent to us three things; viz. 1. The <I>passion
