                           <i>Tribes.</i> Thus were God's promises sweetly fulfilled, and David obtained the quiet dominion over all Israel, excepting
                           perhaps a few of the tribe of Benjamin, according to the Vulgate, 1 Paralipomenon xii. 29. an army of 340,822 was collected
                           on this occasion; and David signalized the commencement of his reign, by the taking of Jerusalem. (Calmet) --- The tribe is
                           Issachar is not specified in the text; but Josephus asserts, that 20,000 of them assembled; so that the army would amount
                           to 359 (Salien) or 60[360?] thousand, besides the 822. (Calmet) --- These might be considered as deputies of all the rest
                           of their brethren, 1 Paralipomenon xii. 38. They were abundantly supplied with all necessities. (Salien) --- <i>Flesh,</i>
                           of the same nation, as Moses had specified, Deuteronomy xvii. 15. (Calmet) --- They now relinquish all the seeds of division,
                           which had before hindered them from joining with their brethren of Juda. Kennicott discovers several important alterations,
                           by comparing this history with 1 Chronicles xi. (Dissert. i.) (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           particularly the governors of the Church, Acts xx., &amp;c. David's name is written without <i>i,</i> in the books before
                           the captivity; whence Kennicott would infer, that the canticles were perhaps not the work of Solomon, as the <i>i</i> occurs

                           Abiathar, received the oaths of allegiance from the people, and of the king, who promised to govern according to the laws
                           of God. The ark was probably present, and innumerable sacrifices offered on this solemn occasion, as was usual, 1 Paralipomenon
                           xii. 26. Hebron continued to be a place for sacrifices, chap xv. 7. (Calmet) --- David had erected here a temporary altar
                           and tabernacle, where Abiathar officiated in his pontifical robes, as it was not safe for the people to go into the dominions
                           of Isboseth, either to Gabaon or to Cariathiarim. (Tostat) --- <i>Israel,</i> acknowledging the right which David had to the

                           (Calmet) though the Israelites had been in the country above 400 years. (Kennicott) --- Nothing could reflect greater glory
                           on the beginning of David's reign, than the seizing of this place, (Calmet) which was deemed so impregnable, that the Jebusites
                           thought <i>the blind and the lame</i> were sufficient to defend it. (Haydock) --- They placed some upon the walls, (Menochius)

                           <i>Gutters.</i> Hebrew <i>Tsinnor,</i> "through (Nodius) the subterraneous passage," (leading to the tops of the houses.)
                           (Hugo of Vienna) --- Thus Babylon was taken by Cyrus, who passed through the channel of the Euphrates, the waters of which
                           he had let out; though the inhabitants had derided his attempt to take the city by siege, as the men of Jebus do here. Polybius
                           says, "Rabatamana, a city of Arabia, could not be taken, till one of the prisoners shewed the besiegers a subterraneous passage,
                           (<i><u>uponomon</u></i>) through which the besieged came down for water." Of the same nature were the gutters here spoken
                           of. (Kennicott) --- "The king promised to give the command of the army to the man who would pass through the cavities (<i><u>pharaggon</u></i>)
                           below, and take the citadel." (Josephus) --- This reward is expressly mentioned in 1 Paralipomenon xi. 6, with the person
                           who obtained it; (St. Jerome, Trad.) and it seems, after <i>David,</i> this ought to be inserted, "shall be the head and captain.
                           And Joab, the son of Sarvia, went up first, and was made the general." (Haydock) ---<i>Hatred.</i> Hebrew, "that are hated
                           by David's soul." Cajetan supposes that the Jebusites in the citadel, are thus distinguished from those who dwelt peaceably
                           in the lower town, with the Israelites. (Calmet) --- <i>Proverb.</i> Protestants insert, "<i>He shall be head and captain.</i>
                           Wherefore they said, the blind....into the house." What is translated <i>temple,</i> may denote also, "the house" of David,
                           or "the place" where this provocation had been given. (Haydock) --- Idols shall never be adored in the true Church. (Worthington)
                           --- Some think that the blind and the lame were excluded from the temple, or from David's palace. But we find that they had
                           free access to the temple; (Matthew xxi. 14., and Acts iii. 2.) and Miphiboseth ate at David's table, though he was lame.
                           If the Jebusites be designated, they were already excluded from the temple, like other infidels of Chanaan. (Calmet) --- Josephus
                           ([Antiquities?] vii. 3.) insinuates, that "David drove them from Jerusalem," though we read of Areuna residing there, chap.
                           xxiv.16. But he might be a proselyte before, and not dwell in the fort. The expression seems however to be proverbial, to
                           signify any very difficult enterprize, which proves successful, and contrary to expectation. (Haydock) --- The Jebusites were
                           thus derided (Sanctius) in their turn. (Tirinus) --- Whether Joab took this strong place by a subterraneous passage, (Haydock)
                           or scaled the walls, and so got to the top, whence the water falls, as from a gutter; (Calmet) it is certain that he displayed
                           the utmost valour, and thus obtained the confirmation of his authority, which David would perhaps have willingly taken from
                           him, (Salien) if another had offered himself, and performed this hazardous enterprize. (Haydock) --- He made a fair offer
                           to all Israel, as they probably expected. (Kennicott)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Inwards.</i> He built or repaired the higher "city of David," beginning at <i>Mello,</i> to "fill up" the valley, which
                           Solomon finished, and adorned with a palace, 3 Kings ix. 15., and 4 Kings xii. 20. The place is probably called Asaramel,
                           1 Machabees xiv. 27. (Calmet) --- Septuagint and Josephus generally understand Mello to designate the citadel of Sion, or
                           "a complete fortification," to defend the city. Instead of <i>inwards,</i> the Septuagint have, "and his house." But <i>ubithe</i>
                           means, "and to the house," temple, or fort, whence he began the enclosure, so as to make a complete communication. (Kennicott)
                           --- This city became "the most famous in all the East." (Pliny, [Natural History?] v. 14.) --- "Walls, built in a crooked
                           manner, according to the rules of art, enclosed two hills, immensely high." (Tacitus, Hist. v.) --- These hills were multiplied,
                           on account of their different summits, so that Josephus speaks of five hills. The palace of David stood on Sion, and the temple
                           on Moria, which was a part of it still more elevated, towards the east. The other hill is often called Acra, by Josephus,
                           and lay southward of Sion. Here the ancient town of Jebus was built. The Machabees took in an adjoining eminence. (Josephus,
                           Jewish Wars vi. 6.) --- Bethsetta, or the new city, was afterwards enclosed. Herod adorned the city with many superb monuments,
                           both of a public and of a private nature. (Calmet) --- We read of ten gates, and of four towers, belonging to this city. It
                           was not well supplied with water, and what it had was brackish. The walls seem never to have exceeded four and a half miles;
                           now they are only three, and include Mount Calvary, which was formerly no part of the city. Button says a valley run from
                           west to east, between the two hills of Zion on the south, and Acra on the north; which contradicts the former statement. (Haydock)
                           --- Villalpand supposes that the citadel was nine and a half stadia, and all the city thirty-five stadia in circumference,
                           eight of which make an Italian mile. (Menochius)</font></p><b>
