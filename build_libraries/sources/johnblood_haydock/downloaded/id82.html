                           with repeating her petitions; how much more will God, who is full of bounty and tenderness to man, and only seek occasions
                           to grant him his gifts, hear the prayers of the fervent, and fill with benedictions the petitioner, who can continue like

                           He sometimes delays, in order to exercise our patience, and increase our ardour: sometimes he grants, in his anger, what,

                           as if in opposition to <I>kneeling</I> or <I>prostrating,</I> which they suppose to be the general posture in which the Jews
                           offered up their prayers, and that of the humble publican. The Christians borrowed this practice from them. We see the apostles
                           and disciples praying on their knees: Acts vii. 59, ix. 40, xx. 36. In the Old Testament, we see the same observed. Solomon,
                           (3 Kings viii. 54.) Daniel, (vi. 10.) and Micheas, (vi. 6.) prayed in that posture. Others however, think that the people
                           generally prayed standing, as there were neither benches nor chairs in the temple. (Calmet) --- There are four ways by which
                           men are guilty of pride: 1st, By thinking they have any good from themselves; 2nd, by thinking that though they have received
                           it from above, it was given them as due to their own merits; 3rd, by boasting of the good they do not possess; and fourthly,
                           by desiring to be thought the only persons that possess the good qualities of which they thus pride themselves. The pride
                           of the Pharisee seems to have consisted in attributing to himself alone the qualities of which he boasted. (St. Gregory, mor.
                           lib. xxiii, chap. 4.) --- He who is guilty of publicly speaking against his neighbour, is likewise the cause of much damage
                           to himself and others. 1st, He injures the hearer; because if he be a sinner, he rejoices to find an accomplice; if he be
                           just, he is tempted to vanity, seeing himself exempt from the crimes with which others are charged. 2nd, He injures the Church,
                           by exposing it to be insulted for the defects of its members. 3rd, He causes the name of God to be blasphemed; for, as God
                           is glorified by our good actions, so is he dishonoured by sin. 4th, He renders himself guilty, by disclosing that which it
                           was his duty not to have mentioned. (St. Chrysostom, Serm. de Phar. et Pub.)</FONT></P><B>

                           sentence was not passed on Job, who praised himself much more; the difference is evident: the former praised himself without
                           any necessity, merely with an intention of indulging his vanity, and extolling himself over the poor publican; the latter,
                           being overwhelmed with misery, and upbraided by his friends, as if, forsaken of God, he suffered his present distress in punishment
                           of his crimes, justifies himself by recounting his virtues for the greater glory of God, and to preserve himself and others
                           in the steady practice of virtue, under similar temptations. (Theophylactus)</FONT></P><B>

                           suffer any thing inflicted by man; they were scandalized in the second place, to hear that sufferings and death could lead
                           to victory and empire; and lastly, they were scandalized, (their own feelings taking the alarm) lest they should be forced
