                                    and hath delivered me from the sword of Pharao.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And Jethro, the kinsman of Moses, came with his sons, and his wife

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And he sent word to Moses, saying: I Jethro, thy kinsman, come to thee,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And he went out to meet his kinsman, and worshipped and kissed him:
                                    and they saluted one another with words of peace. And when he was come into the tent,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 Moses told his kinsman all that the Lord had done to Pharao, and the

                                    them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the good things that the Lord had done

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And he said: Blessed is the Lord, who hath delivered his people out

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 So Jethro, the kinsman of Moses, offered holocausts and sacrifices

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And the next day Moses sat to judge the people, who stood by Moses
                                    from morning until night.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And when his kinsman had seen all things that he did among the people,
                                    he said: What is it that thou dost among the people? Why sittest thou alone, and all the people wait from morning till night?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And Moses answered him: The people come to me to seek the judgment

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And when any controversy falleth out among them, they come to me to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 But he said: The thing thou dost is not good.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 But hear my words and counsels, and God shall be with thee. Be thou
                                    to the people in those things that pertain to God, to bring their words to him:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And to shew the people the ceremonies, and the manner of worshipping,
                                    and the way wherein they ought to walk, and the work that they ought to do.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, in whom

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 Who may judge the people at all times: and when any great matter soever
                                    shall fall out, let them refer it to thee, and let them judge the lesser matters only: that so it may be lighter for thee,
                                    the burden being shared out unto others.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 If thou dost this, thou shalt fulfil the commandment of God, and shalt

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And when Moses heard this, he did all things that he had suggested
