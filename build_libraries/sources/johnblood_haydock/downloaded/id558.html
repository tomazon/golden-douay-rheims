                           the Israelites were too indolent in subduing the people of the country, and fearing lest they should by degrees begin to imitate
                           their corrupt manners, he called a general assembly either at his own city, or at Silo, or more probably at <I>Sichem,</I>
                           (as it is mentioned [in] chap. xxiv. 1, which seems to give farther particulars of this assembly) and laid before his people,

                           courage and strength to Israel, while he filled their opponents with dismay, and this was most frequently the case. He continues
                           to assist his servants in their spiritual warfare against the world, the flesh, and the devil, in all these different ways.

                           reducing the few scattered nations whom he had abandoned to them as a prey. (Haydock) --- They ought to be considered not
                           only as the enemies of God, but also as unjust detainers of another's right, and Josue promises that nothing will be wanting
                           on the part of God to render their reduction easy, if they will but do their duty to Him and to themselves. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           in,</I> an expression which may denote any familiarity, or marriage. (Menochius) --- Hebrew is in the form of a prohibition,
                           "Come not among (have no connections with) these nations....Neither mention their gods, nor swear (or cause to swear by them.")
                           The psalmist (Psalm xv. 4,) says, speaking either of idols, (Haydock) or of sinners, <I>Nor will I be mindful of their names
                           by my lips.</I> Osee (ii. 16,) says, <I>She shall call me no more </I><B>Baali</B>, ("my lord," a term applied by wives to
                           their husbands) on account of its reminding one of the idol Baal. Hence David calls Jerobaal, or Gedeon, Jeroboschot, 2 Kings
                           xi. 21. St. Paul would not have Christians so much as to name the sins of impurity, Ephesians v. 3. The more religious Jews
                           will not even mention an idol, or an unclean animal; and they beg <I>pardon</I> before they speak of a heretic. (Drusius)
                           --- Some understand that the worship of idols is meant by naming them, as those who invoked the name of Jesus Christ, were
                           his disciples, Acts ix. 14., 1 Timothy ii. 19., and Exodus xx. 24. To swear by idols is always sinful, (Exodus xxiii. 13,)
                           while it is an act of religion to swear on proper occasions, by the name of God. Theophrastus (ap. Josephus, contra Apion
                           i.) observes, that the laws of the Tyrians prohibit the using of foreign oaths, such as that of the Corban, which was peculiar
                           to the Jews. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Those who had formerly given way to idolatry were all cut off, and all Israel had lately given a proof of their attachment
