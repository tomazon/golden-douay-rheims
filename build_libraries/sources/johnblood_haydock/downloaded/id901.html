                           <i>Heaven.</i> By <i>heaven</i> here is meant, the air, the lowest of the heavenly regions, (Challoner) through which he was
                           carried by the ministry of angels, who directed the storm, (Haydock ) to the place designed for him. --- It is generally supposed
                           to be Paradise, (Calmet) whither Henoch had been translated. (Haydock) --- They are still living, (Calmet) and must come again,
                           to invite all to repent. After which they will die martyrs, in the persecution of Antichrist. (Haydock) --- See St. Augustine,
                           de Gen. ad lit. ix. 6., and Apocalypse xi. (Worthington) --- Ecclesiasticus xlviii. 10. (Menochius) --- They are a proof of
                           a future resurrection. (Calmet) --- To decide where the paradise which they inhabit, (Haydock) is situated, would be rash.
                           (St. Chrysostom, hom. 21. in Gen. &amp;c.) Some suppose it is still in some unknown region of the earth: others place it above
                           the sky, (Menochius) or in the bosom of Abraham. (Calmet) --- The Jews (following Munster) assert that Elias penetrated the
                           sphere of fire, where his body was consumed. (Vatable) --- The earthly paradise is very probably no longer existing, in its
                           ancient luxuriant state. (Haydock) --- It may now be covered with the waters of the Persian Gulf. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           might be also their children. Elias collected some fervent souls together even at Bethel, to preserve the true religion, as
                           much as possible. He visited them before his departure. (Calmet) --- <i>Peace:</i> let not Elias hear us.</font></p><b>

                           to see me, at my departure. (Haydock) --- This he did, ver. 12. (Menochius) --- Elias had perhaps imagined that his disciple
                           would have desired some of his clothes, or some advice. (Calmet) --- He left him his mantle, (ver. 13.; Haydock) and by prayer

                           very like Helios, "the sun," some have supposed that they have the same meaning: (Sedulius, pasc. 1.) but the Hebrew term
                           signifies, "He is my God." The pagans have taken occasion from this history to represent the sun drawn in a fiery chariot,
