                           year of the world 2622, the 22d year of Othoniel and Phinees.) (Haydock) --- Anarchy at that time prevailed, (ver. 6,) so
                           that we need not wonder to behold such confusion among the Israelites. (Menochius) --- <i>Ephraim.</i> The country was mountainous

                           (Menochius) --- She had lost a sum of money, and was venting <i>imprecations</i> against the thief, when her son came and
                           informed her that he had it safe, upon which she changed her curses into blessings. --- <i>Swear,</i> may have another meaning,

                           she gives to idols, (Menochius) or perhaps she preposterously adored both the true and false gods at the same time. (Calmet)

                           they to excuse all from idolatry but Catholics! (Haydock) --- Almost all interpreters condemn Michas and his mother of superstition,
                           and of acting contrary to the express orders of God, in appointing a priest who was not of the family of Aaron, &amp;c. (Calmet)

                           was first carved, and then covered with plates of gold, &amp;c., in the more ancient times. (Calmet) --- There might be two
                           figures made by Michas. (Salien) --- The Theraphim denote "images which foretel what is to happen." (Rabbins; Tirinus) ---

                           or cherubim, are styled elohim, <i>gods,</i> (ver. 5) and that the altar, candlesticks, &amp;c., are designated above by whatever
                           was to be <i>graven</i> or <i>molten.</i> Michas had a mind to represent the tabernacle, with its ornaments, in miniature.
                           By the theraphim he might imitate the urim, &amp;c., at the expense of 200 sicles, while 900 might be set apart for the other

                           is more probable. For, though he places this history in the 22d year of Othoniel, yet we must remember that he attributes
                           to him all the years of anarchy, so that this liberty was taken by an individual, when none had power or zeal enough to restrain
                           it. How much would Phinees be mortified at this prevarication if he were still alive! (Haydock) --- The title of <i>king</i>

                           mother was of Juda, though his father was the son of Moses, chap. xviii. 30. (Calmet) --- He was poor, as the people neglected

                           advantage: the true character of superstitious misers, 1 Timothy vi. 5. (Calmet) -- He foolishly flattered himself that God
                           would be pleased with his devotion; though he had done so many things contrary to the law. (Menochius) --- Thus many form
                           a religion to themselves, and would still claim the title of Christians. But the judge will drive them away with, <i>I never
                           knew you,</i> Matthew vii. 23. They think that if they believe some things (which they are pleased to call fundamental, though
                           they cannot agree what they are) they may form a "true <i>Catholic</i> church" out of <i>all</i> the contradictory heresies
                           which have made such havoc in the world! Perhaps Michas thus deluded himself with the idea that his innovations were not fundamental.
                           It is rather ridiculous to hear J. Wesley, and a late very weak defendant of his, (Mr. Slack,) refusing the title of Christian
                           to Roman Catholics, while they prostitute it to almost every sectary. But heretics have, indeed, no just pretensions to it.

                                    thou hadst put aside for thyself, and concerning which thou didst swear in my hearing, behold I have, and they are with me.
                                    And she said to him: Blessed be my son by the Lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 So he restored them to his mother, who said to him: I have consecrated
                                    and vowed this silver to the Lord, that my son may receive it at my hand, and make a graven and a molten <i>god;</i> so now
                                    I deliver it to thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 And he restored them to his mother: and she took two hundred pieces
                                    of silver and gave them to the silversmith, to make of them a graven and a molten <i>god</i>, which was in the house of Michas.</font></p>

                                    an ephod, and theraphim, that is to say, a priestly garment, and idols: and he filled the hand of one of his sons, and he
                                    became his priest.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 There was also another young man of Bethlehem Juda, of the kindred

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 Now he went out from the city of Bethlehem, and desired to sojourn
                                    wheresoever he should find it convenient for him. And when he was come to Mount Ephraim, as he was on his journey, and had
                                    turned aside a little into the house of Michas,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 He was asked by him whence he came. And he answered: I am a Levite

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And Michas filled his hand, and had the young man with him for his
