                           different times,</I>[1]<I> and in many ways.</I> The first word signifies that God revealed the incarnation of his Son, as
                           it were, by parcels, and by degrees, at different times, and to different persons, to Adam, to Abraham, to Moses, to David,
                           &amp;c. The latter word expresseth the different ways and manners, as by angels, by immediate inspirations, and revelations,
                           by types, figures, and ceremonies.[2] --- <I>Last of all,</I> by his Son, this true, natural, eternal Son, of whom we must
                           always take notice, that being both true God, and true man, by the union of the divine and human nature to one and the same
                           divine person, St. Paul speaks of him sometimes as God, sometimes mentions what applies to him as man, sometimes as our Redeemer,
                           both God and man. This must necessarily happen in speaking of Christ; but when we find things that cannot be understood of
                           one that is a pure or mere man only, or that cannot be true but of him, who is truly God, these are undeniable proofs against
                           the errors of the Arians and Socinians. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           as Master or Lord. And though Christ be inseparably God and man, yet this applies to him, as man, because, as God, he was
                           not constituted in time, but was always from eternity, Lord of all things, with the Father and the Holy Ghost: <I>by whom

                           the three divine persons. See John i. 3. and the annotations on that place. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           being the spendour,</I>[3] or brightness <I>of his glory,</I> not as beams or rays are derived from a lightsome body, but
                           by a necessary and eternal communication of the same substance, and of the whole light; in which sense the council of Nice[Nicaea]
                           understood the eternal Son of God to be <I>light of light.</I> This partly helps us to conceive the eternal generation of
                           the Son from the Father, because the brightness is at the same time with the sun, though all comparisons fall short of this
                           mystery. (Witham) --- We may here observe the two natures of Christ. As God, he is the Creator of all things; as man, he is
                           constituted heir of the goods of God. Not content to possess the inheritance of his Father in his own person, he will have
                           us as coheirs to share it also with him. May we so live as to hear one day that happy sentence: <I>Come, ye blessed of my
                           Father,</I> &amp;c. --- <I>And the figure of his substance.</I>[4] In the Greek is the <I>character</I> of his substance;
                           which might be translated, the <I>express image.</I> There are different ways by which a thing may be said to be <I>a figure</I>
                           or image of another: here it is taken for such a representation of the substance of the Father, that though the Father and
                           the Son be distinct persons, and the Son proceed from the Father, yet he is such a figure and image, as to have the same nature
                           and substance with the Father, as the Catholic Church always believed and declared against the ancient heretics, and particularly
                           against the Arians. Their words may be partly seen in Petavius, lib. ii. de Trin. chap. 11.; lib. iv. chap. 6.; lib. vi. chap.
                           6., being too prolix for these short notes. And this may be understood by the following words concerning the Son: <I>and upholding</I>
                           or preserving <I>all things by the word of his power.</I> As he had said before, that all things were made by him, so all
                           things are preserved by him, equally with the Father. See Colossians i. 16, 17. See also ver. 10. of this chapter, and the
                           annotations on John i. 3. (Witham) --- <I>Figure.</I> This does not exclude the reality. So Christ's body in the eucharist,
                           and his mystical death in the mass, though called a figure, image, or representation of Christ's visible body and sacrifice
                           upon the cross, yet may be and is the self-same substance. (Bristow) ---<EM>Sitteth on the right hand of </EM><SPAN lang=EN><EM>the
                           majesty on high.</EM> This also may be taken to express the equality of the Son with the Father, if considered as God; but
                           this <EM>sitting on the right hand of God</EM></SPAN><EM>,</EM> both here, in St. Mark, chap. xvi. and in the apostles' creed,
                           express what agrees with Christ, as our Redeemer, God made man by his incarnation, and who as man is made the head of his
                           Church, the judge of the living and of the dead; and so St. Stephen said, (Acts vii.) <I>I see the heavens open, and the Son
                           of man standing at the right hand of God.</I> (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           of God in the day or moment of eternity, yet may be truly applied either to Christ made man by his incarnation, or to Christ
                           risen from the dead, as they are used by St. Paul, (Acts xiii. 33.) because the same Christ both these ways is the Son of
                           God. It was the only true and natural Son of God, who was made flesh, who was made man, who rose from the dead; and the eternal
                           Father manifested his eternal Son by his incarnation, and shewed him triumphing over death by his resurrection. --- <I>I will
                           be to him a father,</I> &amp;c. Although these words might be literally spoken of Solomon, yet in the mystical sense (chiefly
                           intended by the Holy Ghost) they are to be understood of Christ, who in a much more proper sense is the Son of God. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           all the Angels of God adore him.</I> These words seem to be cited out of Psalm xcvi. 7., according to the Septuagint. And
                           they seem to be an invitation, and a command to the Angels to adore Jesus Christ, when at the end of the world he shall come
                           to judgment. This is one of the proofs which St. Paul here brings, to shew that the Angels are inferior to Christ, because
                           they are commanded to adore him. (Witham) --- God shews the superiority of his divine Son over the Angels, in ordering the
                           latter to adore him. Wherever the person of Christ is, there it ought to be adored by both men and Angels, therefore in the
                           blessed sacrament [of the Eucharist].</FONT></P><B>

                           xxxiv. in Evang., would have the sense and construction of the words to be, who maketh the blessed spirits to be also his
                           Angels, or messengers to announce and execute his will: (messengers and Angels signify the same in the Greek) Calvin and Beza

                           But this exposition agrees not with the rest of the text, nor with the design of St. Paul, which is to shew Christ above all
                           the Angels, and above all creatures. St. Paul therefore is to be understood of Angels or angelic spirits: but then the sense
                           may be, who maketh his Angels like the winds, or like a flame of fire, inasmuch as they execute his divine will with incredible

                           <I>And</I> again: <I>thou in the beginning, O Lord, hast founded the earth,</I> &amp;c. The text, as well as the authority
                           of interpreters, shew these words to be still spoken of the Son of God, of Christ, who was both true God and man. And though
                           part of Psalm ci., from which these words are taken, contain a prayer to God for the restoring of the city of Jerusalem, yet
                           in this psalm is chiefly signified the glory of Christ, and of his Church, which will be spread over all nations. See St.
                           Chrysostom, Estius, Cornelius a Lapide, &amp;c. --- <I>As a vesture shalt thou change them,</I> &amp;c. The apostle, in the
                           second verse of this chapter, had said that the world was made by the Son of God: now he tells us that all created things
                           shall wax old like a garment, shall decay and perish, (at least from their present state and condition) shall be changed;
                           but thou, who art both God and man, art always the same, without decay or change. (Witham) --- The apostle here applies the
                           work of the creation to the Son of God, and thus furnishes a clear and striking proof of his divinity, against the Unitarians.
                           To elude this proof, some of them pretend that these verses have been fraudulently added; but they are found in all the Greek
                           copies, and in all ancient versions of this epistle. Others try to give forced interpretations to these verses, but the words
                           are convincingly clear to all who do not purposely shut their eyes.</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>Sit on my right hand,</I> &amp;c. The ancient Jews themselves understood this 109th psalm of their Messias, nor could they
                           answer Christ's words, (Matthew xxii. 45.) when he shewed them by these same words, that their Messias was not only the Son
                           of David, but also the Lord of David, of whom it was said: <I>the Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand, until I
                           make thy enemies thy footstool.</I> See also 1 Corinthians xv. 25. and in this epistle, Chap. x. 13. --- <I>Are they not all
                           ministering spirits?</I> &amp;c. The apostle, in this chapter, not only shews how much the dignity of Christ is superior to
                           that of the highest Angels, but also his divinity; and that he is both true God and true man, as the ancient Fathers took
                           notice against the Arians. (Witham) --- The holy Angels, says St. Augustine, to whose society we aspire, help us without difficulty,
                           because their notion is pure and free. (De Civit. lib. 11. chap. xxxi.) Having then Jesus Christ for our advocate and mediator
                           at the right hand of God, and his Angels for our guardians, ministering spirits, what can we wish for more?</FONT></P>
