                           <i>Finishing.</i> Septuagint, <i><u>exodiou</u></i> or <i><u>exodou</u>,</i> may also signify "the going out;" (Haydock) as
                           if the sacred ministers exhorted their successors to perform their duty in the ensuing week, or on the last day of the feast
                           of tabernacles, Leviticus xxiii. 36. (Calmet) --- Hebrew has only "A canticle of David," (Haydock) and the rest was not in
                           the Hexapla in the time of Theodoret, so that many pay no attention to it. The author seems to have supposed that the psalm
                           was composed when David had finished the tabernacle, on Sion. (Calmet) (2 Kings vi., and 1 Paralipomenon xvi.) --- But the
                           psalmist had in view things of far greater importance, the propagation of Christianity among many great potentates. (Worthington)
                           --- The Fathers explain it in this sense, though it may literally allude (Calmet) to the storm procured by the prayer of Elias,
                           3 Kings xviii. 1, 41. (Haydock) --- It might be composed in a thunder-storm, and used on similar occasions, (Muis) when a
                           person had to go from home. (Haydock) --- The seven voices may allude to the seven sacraments, or trumpets, Apocalypse x.
                           3. (Berthier) --- <i>God.</i> Septuagint seemed to have read <i>Aleim,</i> or they have taken <i>elim</i> in the same sense,
                           as it signifies "the mighty" as well as "rams." On account of this ambiguity, a double translation is given either by the
                           Septuagint, or rather by some later writer, who may have inserted the explanation, <i>O ye children of God, bring ye to the
                           Lord;</i> (Haydock) which has crept from the margin into the text. (Amama) --- It is marked as superfluous by Grabe, (Haydock)
                           not being found in the best Greek copies; or at least have an obel, (Eusebius) to insinuate that it was not in Hebrew, in
                           which state it appears in the Gal. Psalter, published in St. Jerome's works. (Calmet) --- It is not contrary to the original,
                           though more explicit, (Berthier) as the address is made to all the faithful, (Menochius) or to the priests and nobility. (Haydock)
                           --- The apostles are styled rams, because they beat down error with the two Testaments; whence bishops' mitres have two horns.
                           (Lombard; Amama) --- "Give praise to the Lord, ye troops of angels; render to the Lord glory and strength." (Chaldean) (Calmet)
                           --- Be grateful for the favours which are here recounted. (Worthington) --- Most people now translate, "sons of the mighty."
                           Yet St. Jerome and Houbigant have, "offspring of rams;" <i>filios arietum.</i> Bring lambs to the Lord, as the original may
                           certainly mean; though many who are attached to the Hebrew allow also <i>sons of God.</i> (Berthier) --- Montfaucon says that
                           Origen marked with a <i>lemniscus,</i> what he judged "a better reading," and thus obelized the first of these versions, and
                           added the second with an asterisk. This liberty has been attended both with good and bad consequences. (Kennicott)</font></p><b>

                           obliged to remain in the court, where they adored God, as sitting upon the Cherubim, in the most holy place (Calmet) in the
                           Catholic Church. (Worthington) --- External worship must be observed. (Berthier)</font></p><b>

                           the creation; or all these voices may signify the various effects of thunder, or may allude to the terrors preceding the last
                           judgment, (Apocalypse x. 3.) or attending the establishment and liberation of the Jewish and Christian Churches. The first
                           voice was heard when Jesus was baptized, (Matthew iii. 17.) as the rest may intimate the instruction and efficacy of the other
                           sacraments. It is evident that something posterior to the reign of David is prefigured; (Berthier) and the Fathers have generally
                           understood the psalm of the propagation of the gospel by the apostles, two of whom are styled <i>sons of thunder,</i> Mark
                           iii. 17. (Calmet) --- The psalmist speaks of greater things than attended the translation of the ark. He represents our Saviour
                           preaching with great power and majesty, (Matthew vii. 29.) and subjecting the most powerful monarchs to his dominion. (Worthington)
                           --- Thunder is often styled the voice of God, and is occasioned by the collision of the clouds, (Haydock) which Moses calls
                           the waters <i>above.</i> (St. Basil) (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Shall reduce them to pieces,</i> &amp;c. In Hebrew, <i>shall make them to skip like a calf.</i> The psalmist here describes
                           the effects of thunder, (which he calls the voice of the Lord) which sometimes breaks down the tallest and strongest trees;
                           and makes their broken branches skip, &amp;c. All this is to be understood mystically, of the powerful voice of God's word
                           in his Church; which has broke the pride of the great ones of this world, and brought many of them meekly and joyfully to
                           submit their necks to the sweet yoke of Christ. (Challoner) --- <i>Calf,</i> or "branch," as the Greek word also implies.
                           But Hebrew seems more naturally to signify "a calf; Libanus and Sirion, (or Sarion.; Deuteronomy iii. 9.) as the son of the
                           unicorn." These two mountains are represented jolting together. (Calmet) --- The violence of an earthquake has sometimes produced
                           such effects. (Pliny, [Natural History?] ii. 83.) See Psalm cxiii. 4., Judges v. 5., and Habacuc iii. 10. (Calmet) --- <i>And
                           as.</i> The construction <i>&amp; dilectus,</i> seems rather to make this another nominative, "the Lord shall, &amp;c., and
                           the beloved, (Haydock) the <i>Messias,</i> like the son of the unicorn," shall perform the like wonders. It seems probable
                           that the Septuagint have read Jeshurun for Shirion, (Berthier) or <i>vissron,</i> instead of <i>ussriun;</i> as <i>i</i> would
                           only be a little transposed. (Haydock) --- Jeshurun is a title of Israel, (Deuteronomy xxxii. 15., and xxxiii. 5, 26.) who
                           was a figure of the Messias, the <i>beloved</i> of God. (Berthier) --- "And he will scatter them as a calf <i>would do;</i>
                           Libanus and Sarion, <i>are in motion,</i> like the son of the rhinoceros." (St. Jerome) (Haydock) The most powerful submit
                           to Christ, who works these wonders. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Fire.</i> Lightning, which deals destruction around. (Calmet) --- The Holy Ghost appeared in the form of parted tongues
                           of fire, to enable the apostles to convert the <i>desert</i> of the Gentile world, and the Jews, represented by the desert
                           of <i>Cades,</i> (Worthington) which was near their country, (Haydock) on the frontiers of Idumea, Numbers xiii. 27. (Calmet)
                           --- Holy orders were instituted by Christ, to confer grace to the sacred ministers, according to their different stations
                           or exigencies; (Berthier) or extreme unction, which prepares the soul for her separation from the body, may be here meant,
                           if we follow the usual disposition of the sacraments; as the following sentence may allude to holy orders, which shakes or
                           causes the desert to fructify, (Haydock) unless these words be rather applicable to matrimony. (Berthier) --- <i>Shaketh</i>
                           and <i>shakes.</i> St. Jerome has <i>parturire faciens,</i>&nbsp;"making the desert bring forth." Chaldean, "frightens the

                           But the reverse seems to be the case. (St. Chrysostom in Job xxxix. 3.) (Calmet) --- They are very swift, and trample serpents

                           of the last sacrament, which prepares us for our passage; (Berthier) or of matrimony, by means of which the world is peopled
                           with rational beings, whose duty it is to glorify God in his temple. (Haydock) --- This is also the effect of grace, and of
                           the preaching of the gospel, (Berthier) which inspires people with a desire of running on in the way of perfection. Christ
                           explains to them hidden mysteries in his Church, to which he bring multitudes, like the waters, ruling over them, and enabling
                           them to overcome all temptations, till he crown his elect with eternal <i>peace.</i> (Worthington) --- <i>Glory.</i> Running
                           thither through fear, or to thank God for rain after a drought.</font></p><b>

                                    <P>4 The voice of the Lord <I>is </I>in power; the voice of the Lord in magnificence.</P>
                                    <P>5 The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars: yea, the Lord shall break the cedars of Libanus.</P>
                                    <P>6 And shall reduce them to pieces, as a calf of Libanus, and as the beloved son of unicorns.</P>
                                    <P>7 The voice of the Lord divideth the flame of fire: 8 The voice of the Lord shaketh the desert: and the Lord shall shake
