                           <I>Now if any man build,</I> &amp;c. This is a hard place, says St. Augustine, lib. de fid. &amp; Oper. chap. xvi. tom. 6.
                           p. 180. The interpreters are divided, as to the explication and application of this metaphorical comparison, contained in
                           these four verses. St. Paul speaks of <I>a building,</I> where it is evident, says St. Augustine, that the <I>foundation</I>
                           is Christ, or the faith of Christ, and his faith working by charity. The difficulties are 1. Who are the <I>builders.</I>
                           2. What is meant by <I>gold, silver, precious stones,</I> and what by <I>wood, hay, stubble.</I> 3. What is meant by <I>the
                           day of the Lord.</I> 4. What by <I>fire,</I> how <I>every one's work</I> shall be <I>tried,</I> and how some shall be <I>saved
                           by fire.</I> As to the first, by the <I>builders,</I> as St. Paul had before called himself the first <I>architect,</I> who
                           had laid the foundation of the faith of Christ among the Corinthians, interpreters commonly understand those doctors and preachers
                           who there succeeded St. Paul: but as it is also said, that <I>every man's works</I> shall be <I>made manifest,</I> St. Augustine
                           and others understand not the preachers only, but all the faithful. As to the second difficulty, if by the builders we understand
                           the preachers of the gospel, then <I>by gold, silver,</I> &amp;c., is to be understood, good, sound, and profitable doctrine;
                           and <I>by wood, hay, stubble,</I> a mixture of vain knowledge, empty flourishes, unprofitable discourses; but if all the faithful
                           are builders, they whose actions are pure, lay <I>gold</I> upon the foundation; but if their actions <I>are mixed with</I>
                           imperfections, venial failings, and lesser sins, these are represented by <I>wood, hay, stubble,</I> &amp;c. 3. By <I>the
                           day of the Lord,</I> is commonly understood either the day of general judgment, or the particular judgment, when every one
                           is judged at his death, which sentence shall be confirmed again at the last day. 4. As to <I>fire,</I> which is mentioned
                           thrice, if we consider what St. Paul says here of fire, he seems to use it in different significations, as he many times does
                           other words. First, he tells us, (ver. 13.) that <I>the day of the Lord...shall be revealed;</I> or, as it is in the Greek,
                           <I>is revealed in,</I> or by <I>fire;</I> where, by <I>fire,</I> is commonly understood the just and severe judgments of God,
                           represented by the metaphor of <I>fire.</I> Secondly, he tells us in the same verse, that <I>fire shall try every one's work,
                           of what sort it is.</I> This may be again taken for the examining and trying fire of God's judgments: and may be applied to
                           the builders, whether preachers only or all the faithful. Thirdly, he tells us, (ver. 14. and 15.) that some men's works <I>abide</I>
                           the fire of God's judgments, they deserve no punishment, they are like pure gold, which receives no prejudice from the fire:
                           but some men's <I>works</I> burn, the superstructure, which they built upon the faith of Christ, besides <I>gold, silver,
                           precious stones,</I> had also a mixture of <I>wood, hay, stubble,</I> which could not stand the trial of fire, which met with
                           combustible matter, that deserved to be burnt. Every such man shall <I>suffer a loss,</I> when his works are burnt, <I>but
                           he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</I> Here the apostle speaks of fire in a more ample signification: of a fire
                           which shall not only try, and examine, but also <I>burn,</I> and punish the builders, who notwithstanding shall also, after
                           a time, escape from the fire, and be <I>saved by fire,</I> and in <I>the day of the Lord,</I> that is, after life (for the
                           time of this life is the day of men). Divers of the ancient fathers, as well as later interpreters, from these words, prove
                           the Catholic doctrine of a purgatory, that is, that many Christians, who die guilty, not of heinous or mortal sins, but of
                           lesser, and what are called venial sins, or to whom a temporal punishment for the sins they have committed, still remains
                           due, before they can be admitted to a <I>reward</I> in heaven, (into which nothing <I>defiled</I> or <I>unclean can enter</I>)
                           must suffer some punishments for a time, in some place, which is called Purgatory, and in such a manner, as is agreeable to
                           the divine justice, before their reward in heaven. These words of the apostle, the Latin Fathers in the Council of Florence[1]
                           brought against the Greeks to prove purgatory, to which the Greeks (who did not deny a purgatory, or a third place, where
                           souls guilty of lesser sins were to suffer for a time) made answer, that these words of St. Paul were expounded by St. Chrysostom
                           and some of their Greek Fathers (which is true) of the wicked in hell, who are said to <I>be saved by fire,</I> inasmuch as
                           they always subsist and continue in those flames, and are not destroyed by them: but this interpretation, as the Latin bishops
                           replied, is not agreeable to the style of the holy Scriptures, in which, <I>to be saved,</I> both in the Greek and Latin,
                           is expressed the salvation and happiness of souls in heaven. It may not be amiss to take notice that the Greeks, before they
                           met with the Latins at Ferrara, of Florence, did not deny the Catholic doctrine of purgatory. They admitted a third place,
                           where souls guilty of lesser sins, suffered for a time, till cleansed from such sins: they allowed that the souls there detained
                           from the vision of God, might be assisted by the prayers of the faithful: they called this purgatory a place of <I>darkness,</I>
                           of <I>sorrow,</I> of <I>punishments,</I> and <I>pains,</I> but they did not allow there a true and material fire, which the
                           Council did not judge necessary to decide and define against them, as appears in the definition of the Council. (Conc. Labb
                           tom. xiii. p. 515.) (Witham) --- The fire of which St. Paul here speaks, is the fire of purgatory, according to the Fathers,
                           and all Catholic divines. (Calmet) --- St. Augustine, expounding Psalm xxxvii. ver. 1., gives the proper distinction between
                           this fire of purgatory and that of hell: both are punishments, one temporary, the other eternal; the latter to punish us in
                           God's justice, the former to amend us in his mercy.</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>Know you not.</I> After the apostle had described the builders who are employed in the spiritual edifice, he then proceeds
                           to speak of the duties of those who are the living temples of Christ. As for you, may brethren, who are the temples of God,

                           were distinguished by the title of Platonics, Stoics, Peripatetic, and so on. (Grotius)</FONT></P><B>

                           the year] 1438. The Greeks at the very first declared they admitted a third place, where souls were punished for a time, which
                           they called a place of darkness and sorrow. See Labb. tom. xiii. Con. p. 20. Græci fatentur pænam temporaneam, quod peccatis
                           obnoxiorum animæ in locum abeunt tenebricosum, in locum mæroris, in quo, ad tempus, versantur in m&#339;rore &amp; pænis,&nbsp;<I><U>eis

                           mærorem, &amp; p&#339;næ locum asserunt, Itali pænam, purgationemque per ignem. See again p. 491. Sess. 25. where the Greeks
                           say of such souls, that they are in a middle state, medias autem esse in loco tormentorum, sed sive ignis sit, sive caligo,
                           sive turbo, sive quid aliud, non contendimus. See also the definition of the Council, p. 515., where it is only defined, eorum

                           which was the doctrine both of the Greek and Latin Church. See on this place of St. Paul, Bellarmine, lib. i. de Purgatorio,
