                           Origen reckons this to be the most ancient piece of poetry. It is truly sublime, and calculated to fill the souls of those,

                           towards their almighty benefactor. (Haydock) --- God miraculously gave utterance to the dumb on this occasion, (Widsom x.
                           21.) and taught the whole congregation of Israel to join in harmonious concert. (De Mirab. S. S. inter. op. St. Augustine)
                           This mode of perpetuating the memory of past benefits by canticles, is very common in Scripture. (Calmet) --- <I>Let us sing.</I>
