                           <i>Year.</i> It seems the Persians began the year with Tizri, since both Casleu (the third) and Nisan (the seventh month of
                           the civil year) fall on the twentieth of the king. --- <i>Wine.</i> These kings drunk only that of Syria. (Strabo xv.) ---
                           People of distinction were appointed cup-bearers; and even the children of kings did not esteem the office beneath them. (Herodotus
                           iii. 34.) (Athen. x. 6.) (Homer, &amp;c.) (Calmet) --- <i>I was.</i> Protestants, "I had not been <i>before-time</i> sad in
                           his presence." (Haydock) --- Hebrew literally, "I was not evil." Septuagint, "an enemy, <i>or</i> stranger." Arabic, "disagreeable."
                           Syriac, "sorrowful." Septuagint also, "there was not another (<i><u>ouk en eteros</u></i>) present," chap. v. 6. St. Jerome
                           seems not to have read the negation. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           Septuagint, "This is nothing but wickedness of heart," (Haydock) which often shews itself on the countenance. The king might
                           suspect that he was giving him poison. (Menochius) --- Hence Nehemias feared, (Calmet) dreading such suspicions, (Haydock)
                           and aware lest the company might frustrate his good design, as contrary to the interests of the crown. (Tirinus)</font></p><b>

                           they sometimes cover with wax, and keep in their house, (Cic.[Cicero?] Tusc. i.; Alex. Genial iii. 2.) or inter. (Herodotus

                           and returned into Judea towards the end of the reign of Artaxerxes, chap. xiii. 6. (Calmet) --- He perhaps asked permission
                           to visit Jerusalem for only a short period, at first, but his presence being deemed necessary, he was permitted to continue
                           there as governor full twelve years. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           a "paradise," in C&#339;losyria. (Grotius) --- But Nehemias might petition to be supplied with cedars from Libanus, (Tirinus)
                           as they had been given for the temple, 1 Esdras iii. 7. (Haydock) --- <i>Tower.</i> Hebrew <i>bira,</i> means also "a palace
                           or temple." It may designate the porch of the temple, which was 120 cubits high; (2 Paralipomenon iii. 4.; Calmet) though
                           that had been lately repaired by Esdras. (Menochius) --- Others think the doors of the courts are meant, as they were as strong
                           as those of towers. (Vatable) --- They were not yet finished, chap. x. 9. Many believe that (Calmet) Nehemias speaks of the
                           royal palace, which had been almost contiguous to the temple, (Menochius) where he intended to build one for himself, while
                           he should reside in the city. (Tirinus) --- But this might give umbrage to the king. (Calmet) --- He could not, however, intend
                           his favourite to remain without a suitable palace; and the latter seems to have designed not only to repair that which Solomon
                           had founded, but also to erect another <i>house</i> for the governor. (Haydock) --- <i>Good hand;</i> favour, (Menochius)
