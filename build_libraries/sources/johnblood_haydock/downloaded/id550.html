                           <i>Sin,</i> or <i>Sina,</i> (ver. 3,) bordering upon Idumea, where the city of Cades-barne was situated, Numbers xiii. 22.
                           It is now impossible to ascertain the precise situation of all the place mentioned in Scripture, as the land of Chanaan has
                           been subject to so many changes. But this inconvenience attends all ancient geography. If those who attempt to unravel such
                           labyrinths in profane authors, deserve praise, much more do those who do their utmost to explain the difficulties of sacred
                           history. It was once very necessary to have the limits of the tribes marked out with precision, that, at the return from captivity,
                           they might occupy their own. Now we may be satisfied if we can point out some of the places of the greatest importance. The
                           limits of the tribe of Juda are specified with particular care, on account of the dignity and power of that tribe, which was
                           to give kings to all the land, and a Messias to the world, as well as to preserve the true religion. The greatest part of
                           the southern regions of Chanaan fell to their share, from the Dead Sea, by Idumea, to the Nile, and as far north as Jerusalem
                           and the torrent of Cedron. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Brother.</i> It is not clear in the original whether this relates to Cenez or to Othoniel, (Haydock) as <i>younger</i>
                           is not found in [the] Hebrew but it is in the Syriac, Septuagint, and Judges i. 13. Many think that Cenez was the brother
                           of Caleb. If Othoniel had been brother of the latter, they say he could not have legally married his niece. (Calmet) --- But
                           though Moses forbids a nephew to marry his aunt, it does not follow that uncles could not take their nieces to wife, as they
                           would be still the head; (Worthington) whereas there would be a sort of indecency for a nephew to command his aunt. The Jews
                           allow these marriages, while the Samaritans condemn them, Leviticus xviii. 14. In confirmation of the Vulgate, we may remark,
                           that Cenez is never (Calmet) clearly (Haydock) represented as the brother of Caleb; and there is no inconvenience in asserting
                           that Othoniel was the <i>brother</i> of the latter, whether we take this word to denote a near relation, or strictly. In the
                           former supposition, Othoniel might marry his cousin, Axa, the daughter of Caleb, while he himself was descended from Cenez,
                           the brother of Jephone. (Calmet) --- But if we take the word strictly, as the remark of his being <i>younger brother,</i>
                           both here and Judges i. 13., may seem to imply, we must then allow that Othoniel followed the custom of his nation, (Haydock)
                           in marrying his niece. (Menochius) --- Septuagint here make him "the younger son of Cenez, who was brother of Caleb;" and
                           in the Book of Judges, they say, "Gothoniel, the son of Cenez, (and) the younger brother of Caleb, first made himself master
                           of it, under him;" as if Othoniel and Caleb had been born of the same mother, but of a different father, unless we suppose
                           that they were only nearly related, and the former much less advanced in years; so that he might well marry the daughter of
                           Caleb and afterwards become a judge and deliverer of Israel, Judges iii. 9. See Masius; Bonfrere. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Was moved;</i> as the Syriac, Arabic, Junius, &amp;c., represent the matter. Others render the Hebrew in a different sense:
                           "she moved him to ask of her father a field, and she lighted off <i>her</i> ass, and Caleb said unto her," &amp;c., which
                           seems very abrupt, as she herself is represented as soliciting for the favour in the next verse, instead of her husband. The
                           Chaldean supposes that she was restrained by natural modesty, from preferring the petition; but when Othoniel refused to do
                           it, or was denied what he requested, she took courage and asked herself. The sense of the Vulgate seems more natural, (Calmet)
                           as the husband might easily suppose that she would have greater influence with her father. (Haydock) --- <i>Sighed.</i> The
                           original term is found only in this history, and in that of the death of Sisara, Judges iv. 21. Septuagint, "she cried out."
                           Others translate, "she remained fixed," (Menochius) or "she waited sitting on the ass," till she had obtained her request.</font></p><b>

                           of <i>southern;</i> as the lands in that situation being exposed to the sun-beams, in Palestine, are often destitute of sufficient
                           moisture, which is the cause of the sterility of Mount Hebal, &amp;c. --- <i>Watery ground.</i> Hebrews, "springs of water,

                           Septuagint, "Golathmaim, and the upper Golath," &amp;c. Symmachus translates "possession on the high places," Judges i. (Calmet)
                           --- Caleb had probably given his daughter a part of the mountain. He now grants her also some field that lay lower down, and
                           was better supplied with water on all sides (Haydock) by springs above, and cisterns below.</font></p><b>

                           Septuagint here add many cities, which are omitted in Hebrew. (Calmet) --- "Theco and Ephrata, (this is Bethlehem) and Phagor,
                           and Artam, and Koulon, and Tatami, and Sores, and Karem, and Gallim, and Baither, and Manocho, eleven cities and their villages."
                           (Haydock) See St. Jerome in Micheas v. 1. (Calmet) (Deuteronomy xxvii. 4.) --- Dr. Wall says, "these cities were doubtless
                           in the Hebrew copy of the Septuagint" and "they are of such a nature, that it is scarcely possible to think them an interpolation."
                           The former critic thinks "the omission in the Hebrew was occasioned by the word <i>villages</i> occurring immediately before,
                           and at the end of the words thus omitted; and indeed the same word occurring in different places, has been the cause of many
                           and great omissions in the Hebrew manuscripts. He thinks it less likely that the Jews should have <i>designedly</i> omitted
                           Bethlehem here, because that place is mentioned as belonging to Juda, in several other parts of Scripture." But is Ephrata
                           ever joined with it, except in this passage, and in the text of Micheas? "And, therefore, though this remarkable omission
                           was probably owing, at first, to some transcriber's mistake, its not being reinserted might be owing to the reason specified
                           by St. Jerome, out of malice to Christianity." (Kennicott, 2 Diss. 56.) --- Reland is astonished to find a place which was
                           to be rendered so famous by the birth of the Messias, not enumerated in this place among the cities of Juda. But he observes
                           that it is found in the Alexandrian version, p. 643. (Palest.) --- St. Jerome will not decide absolutely whether the Jews
                           have erased these cities, or the Septuagint have inserted them. As he undertook to translate the Hebrew as he found it, he
                           has not admitted these cities into his translation, though there seems to be abundant reason for supposing that they are genuine.

                           other tribes. Hence some have inferred that alterations have been made in the original copies. But we may rather believe that
                           the reason of these variations is, because the cities were parcelled out among the 10 families of Juda, (1 Paralipomenon ii.
                           3,) as was the case in the distribution of land to Manasses; (chap. xvii. 2,) and hence the same cities were sometimes given
                           to two different families. They are also attributed to different tribes, because many families of the respective tribes dwelt
                           in them. The priests, for example, lived along with their brethren of other tribes. (Calmet)</font></p><b>
