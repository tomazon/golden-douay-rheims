                           <P>Ver. 1.</B> <I>Day,</I> while it was yet dark. (Josephus) --- This action would seem rash, and contrary to military discipline,
                           which requires that the general should be apprised of any hazardous enterprise. (Calmet) --- But it is thought that Jonathan
                           was directed by God, who granted him success. (Cornelius a Lapide) --- The Rabbins say, "every augury which is not like that
                           of Eleazar and Jonathan, is null. If they had done ill,...God would not have heard them." (Kimchi)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 2.</B> <I>Magron,</I> a village between Gabaa and Machmas, Isaias x. 28. Hebrew reads "Remmon," which means "a pomegranate
                           tree," and denotes a famous impregnable rock, with extensive caverns, where an equal number of men had formerly saved themselves,
                           Judges xx. 47. (Calmet) (Tirinus) (Menochius)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 3.</B> <I>Ephod;</I> or was high priest, ver. 18. Achias is called Achimelech, chap. xxii. 9. (Calmet) --- He had
                           succeeded his father, Achitob, in the beginning of Saul's reign, after the former had held the dignity twenty-two years. (Salien,
                           the year of the world 2962.)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 6.</B> <I>Uncircumcised.</I> The Hebrews looked upon the Gentiles as unclean and they, in their turn, spoke of the
                           Jews in the most contemptuous manner. (Calmet) --- <I>It may.</I> Literally, "if perchance." (Haydock) --- This does not express
                           any doubt. The hero found himself impelled to undertake this work, but he knew not by what means God would crown it with success.
                           He therefore prays to him in this manner, as Abraham's servant had done, Genesis xxiv. 12. He does not tempt God no more than
                           Gedeon and Moses, who begged that the Lord would manifest his will by miracles. (Calmet) --- <I>Few.</I> These words are often
                           repeated, (2 Paralipomenon xiv. 11., and 1 Machabees iii. 18,) and were verified, chap. xvii. 47., and Judges vii. 4. (Menochius)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 10.</B> <I>This shall be a sign.</I> It is likely Jonathan was instructed by divine inspiration, to make choice of
                           this sign; otherwise, the observation of <I>omens</I> is superstitious and sinful. (Challoner) (Menochius) (Worthington)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 11.</B> <I>Philistines,</I> probably on the northern rock, as they afterwards climbed up that on the south, (Calmet)
                           where they had not been discovered. (Salien) </P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 12.</B> <I>A thing,</I> making you pay dear for this temerity. Herodotus (v.) mentions, that the Peonians were commanded
                           by the oracle not to attack the Perinthians, unless they were challenged. They did so, and gained a complete victory.</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 14.</B> <I>Day.</I> Varro, &amp;c., allow 120 feet, Columella only 70, for a day's work, so that these twenty men
                           were slain in the space of 60 or 35 feet. Louis de Dieu rejects all the other versions, and would translate the Hebrew "in
                           almost the half of the length of a furrow, and in the breadth which is between two furrows in a field," so that the enemy
                           would be very close together. Literally, "almost in the half of a furrow of a yoke of the field," which seems rather to be
                           understood of the length, (Calmet) if indeed it have any meaning. Protestants are forced to help out the text: "within as
                           it were a half acre of land, <I>which</I> a yoke <I>of oxen might plough.</I>" (Haydock) --- But a whole acre was the usual
                           allowance. (Menochius) --- Hallet observes, "the Septuagint read the Hebrew in a different manner, and have rendered the verse
                           thus, 'That first slaughter was....of about twenty men, with darts, and stones, and flints of the field:' I suppose the read,

                           Kennicott adds, and <I>ubgomri,</I> as the Arabs still use <I>gomor,</I> to denote "a small flint." (Golius) (Haydock)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 15.</B> <I>Miracle.</I> Hebrew <I>charada,</I> "consternation<I> or</I> trembling," a panic fear, as the Philistines
                           imagined that all the army of Israel had got into the camp. "In the terrors sent by demons, (<I>or</I> superior beings) even
                           the sons of the gods flee away." (Pindar. Nem.) The earth quaked (Calmet) to increase the enemies' apprehensions, so that
                           those who had gone out to plunder, hearing of the disaster, which report had greatly magnified, and all the people feeling
                           this unusual and alarming motion of the earth, perceived that God was fighting against them, and trembled. (Haydock)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 16.</B> <I>Gabaa,</I> where they were stationed to observe the enemies' motions, and to give notice of them to Saul,
                           at Remmon, ver. 2. (Calmet) --- <I>Overthrown.</I> Hebrew, "melted down, (without courage) and they went crushing" one another
                           is the narrow passes, (Haydock) and turning their arms against all they met. (Josephus)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 17.</B> <I>Were not.</I> Hebrew, "when they had numbered, behold Jonathan, &amp;c., not" in the number. (Haydock)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 18.</B> <I>Ark.</I> Septuagint, "the ephod." (Kimchi, &amp;c.) --- Spencer follows the sentiment of the Rabbins, and
                           explains it of a little box, in which the ephod and pectoral were placed, when they were brought to the army. But what need
                           of this explication? (Calmet) --- How the oracle was given is uncertain. (Menochius)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 19.</B> <I>Hand.</I> He prayed with his hands extended. Saul believed that God had sufficiently intimated his will,
                           by affording such a favourable opportunity. "The best of omens is to revenge our country's wrongs." (Hector. Iliad.) (Menochius)
                           --- <I>Optimis auspiciis ea geri, quæ pro Reip. salute fierent,</I> was the observation of Q. F. Maximus. Senect. (Calmet)
                           --- Saul did not wait for God's answer, and therefore had nearly lost his son by a rash vow, and by too eager zeal. (Worthington)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 21.</B> <I>Before;</I> that is, for some time, as slaves. (Menochius) --- Having retired to their <I>camp,</I> to
                           avoid the plunderers, (Calmet) they rose upon their oppressors, as Christian slaves have often done upon the Turks, when a
                           galley has been engaged, and fallen into the hands of their friends. (Menochius) --- <I>Camp.</I> Hebrew adds, "round about,"
                           as if they guarded the baggage, (Piscator) or had retreated thither form the environs. (Calmet)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 22.</B> <I>And there,</I> &amp;c. This is not found in Hebrew, &amp;c., nor in many Latin copies. The Septuagint specify
                           the number, (ver. 24) where it is not in the original. (Calmet)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 23.</B> <I>Bethaven.</I> They pursued the stragglers thither, as well as to Aialon, ver. 31. (Haydock)</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 24.</B> <I>Together.</I> Which interpretation is more natural (Calmet) than the Protestants "where distressed,...for
                           Saul had adjured," &amp;c. (Haydock) --- Septuagint, "And all the people was with Saul, about 10,000, and the war was spread
                           through all the city in Mount Ephraim, and Saul was guilty of great ignorance that day, and he adjures (Haydock; <I>or</I>
                           cursed) the people," &amp;c. He saw not that he was acting against his own interest. The sequel does not evince that God approved
                           of his conduct. But the people were to be taught not to make light of oaths, nor to neglect the curses which their rulers
                           should denounce. (Calmet) --- <I>Food.</I> Literally, "bread," which comprises all sorts of food, honey, &amp;c., (ver. 25.;
                           Haydock) but not drink, which might lawfully have been taken, as thirst is more difficult to bear. (Menochius) --- Salien
                           (the year of the world 2964) defends the conduct of Saul, and condemns Jonathan.</P><B>
                           <P>Ver. 25.</B> <I>Ground.</I> Even still travellers perceive the smell of honey very frequently in that country. (Maundrell)
                           --- The people use honey almost in every sauce and in every repast. Virgin assures us, that "bees dwell in holes under ground,
                           in hollow stones, and trees." (Georg. iv.) The Scripture frequently mentions honey flowing, Exodus ii. 8., Psalm lxx. 17.,
                           and Job xx. 17.</P>

                           <P>Sanctius says, that in Spain, streams of honey may be seen on the ground; and Maldonet observes, that the countrymen get

                           <P>Ver. 27.</B> <I>Enlightened.</I> Extreme hunger and fatigue hurt the eyes, Jeremias xiv. 6. Sanctius saw a man who through
                           fasting lost his sight, and recovered it again as soon as he had eaten. This is conformable to the observations of Hippocrates,
                           and to nature. (Calmet) --- <I>Tenebræ oboriuntur, genua <I><FONT size=3>inedi</FONT><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman"><FONT

                           He thought he might do so in quality of king, thus consecrating a monument of his victory to the God of armies. It was perhaps
                           the very stone on which the oxen had been just before killed for the people. (Calmet)</P><B>

                           of them, at least, knew that he had transgressed the order of his father, ver. 28. But extreme necessity might plead his excuse.

                           God was pleased on this occasion to let the lot fall upon him, to shew to all, the great obligation of obedience to princes
                           and parents, (Challoner) the sacred nature of an oath, and at the same time to give Saul a warning not to swear rashly. (Calmet)

                           and the blindness of Saul, who condemns his son with as much haste as he had pronounced the curse, thinking thus to honour
                           God. The thing surely required some deliberation, and he ought to have consulted the Lord about it. The action of Jonathan
                           was not criminal, and the former silence of God did not prove that he deserved death. (Calmet) --- If it had, the people would
                           never have been able to have rescued him, no more than the unhappy Achan, Josue vii. (Haydock) --- If Saul had been more enlightened,
                           and more humble, he would have concluded that God was displeased at him, and not at Jonathan. (Calmet) --- Yet Cajetan and
                           Serarius find fault with the latter. (Menochius)</P><B>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">1 Now it came to pass one day that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to
                                    the young man that bore his armour: Come, and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines, which is on the other side
                                    of yonder place. But he told not this to his father.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gabaa, under the pomegranate-tree,
                                    which was in Magron: and the people with him were about six hundred men.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 And Achias, the son of Achitob, brother to Ichabod, the son of Phinees,
                                    *the son of Heli, the priest of the Lord in Silo, wore the ephod. And the people knew not whither Jonathan was gone.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 Now there were between the ascents, by which Jonathan sought to go
                                    over to the garrison of the Philistines, rocks standing up on both sides, and steep cliffs like teeth on the one side, and
                                    on the other, the name of the one was Boses, and the name of the other was Sene:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 One rock stood out toward the north, over-against Machmas, and the
                                    other to the south, over-against Gabaa.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour: Come, let
                                    us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised, it may be the Lord will do for us: because it is easy for the Lord to save
                                    either by many, or by few.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And his armour-bearer said to him: Do all that pleaseth thy mind: go
                                    whither thou wilt, and I will be with thee wheresoever thou hast a mind.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And Jonathan said: Behold we will go over to these men. And when we
                                    shall be seen by them,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 If they shall speak thus to us: Stay till we come to you: let us stand

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 But if they shall say: Come up to us: let us go up, because the Lord
                                    hath delivered them into our hands, this shall be a sign unto us.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 So both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines:
                                    and the Philistines said: Behold the Hebrews come forth out of the holes wherein they were hid.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And the men of the garrison spoke to Jonathan, and to his armour-bearer,
                                    and said: Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armour-bearer: Let us go up, follow me: *for
                                    the Lord hath delivered them into the hands of Israel.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And Jonathan went up creeping on his hands and feet, and his armour-bearer
                                    after him. And some fell before Jonathan, others his armour-bearer slew as he followed him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his armour-bearer made,
                                    was of about twenty men, within half an acre of land, which a yoke of oxen is wont to plough in a day.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And there was a miracle in the camp, in the fields: and all the people
                                    of their garrison, who had gone out to plunder, were amazed, and the earth trembled: and it happened as a miracle from God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And the watchmen of Saul, who were in Gabaa of Benjamin looked, and
                                    behold a multitude overthrown, and fleeing this way and that.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And Saul said to the people that were with him: Look, and see who
                                    is gone from us. And when they had sought, it was found that Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And Saul said to Achias: Bring the ark of the Lord. (For the ark of
                                    God was there that day with the children of Israel.)</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And while Saul spoke to the priest, there arose a great uproar in
                                    the camp of the Philistines: and it increased by degrees, and was heard more clearly. And Saul said to the priest: Draw in
                                    thy hand.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 Then Saul, and all the people that were with him, shouted together,
                                    and they came to the place of the fight: and behold every man's sword was turned upon his neighbour, and there was a very
                                    great slaughter.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 Moreover, the Hebrews that had been with the Philistines yesterday
                                    and the day before, and went up with them into the camp, returned to be with the Israelites, who were with Saul and Jonathan.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And all the Israelites that had hid themselves in Mount Ephraim, hearing
                                    that the Philistines fled, joined themselves with their countrymen in the fight. And there were with Saul about ten thousand
                                    men.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And the Lord saved Israel that day. And the fight went on as far as

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And one of the people answering, said: Thy father hath bound the people

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And Jonathan said: My father hath troubled the land: you have seen

                                    which they found? had there not been made a greater slaughter among the Philistines?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 So they smote that day the Philistines from Machmas to Aialon. And

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 And falling upon the spoils, they took sheep, and oxen, and calves,
                                    and slew them on the ground: and the people ate them with the blood.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And they told Saul that the people had sinned against the Lord, eating

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And Saul said: Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And Saul said: Let us fall upon the Philistines by night, and destroy

                                    And the priest said: Let us draw near hither unto God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 And Saul consulted the Lord: Shall I pursue after the Philistines?

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 And he said to all Israel: Be you on one side and I, with Jonathan,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 And Saul said to the Lord: O Lord God of Israel, give a sign, by <i>which

                                    Jonathan, give a proof: or if this iniquity be in thy people, give holiness. And Jonathan and Saul were taken, and the people
                                    escaped.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 And Saul said: Cast lots between me, and Jonathan, my son. And Jonathan

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 And Saul said to Jonathan: Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 And Saul said: May God do so and so to me, and add still more: for

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">45 And the people said to Saul: Shall Jonathan then die, who hath wrought

                                    for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people delivered Jonathan, that he should not die.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">46 And Saul went back, and did not pursue after the Philistines: and
