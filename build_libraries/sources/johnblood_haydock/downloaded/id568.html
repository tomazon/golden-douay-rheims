                           Samgar is passed over, either because he was only a private man, who performed a feat of valour like Jahel, (chap. v. 6.;
                           Salien) or because his government was so short and limited. Hence we need not wonder that he could not put a stop to the ravages
                           of the Chanaanites, nor to the disorders of the people.</FONT></P><B>

                           Josue defeated the king of this country, Josue xi. 8. But some of his successors had contrived to raise themselves again to
                           power. His dominion probably extended only over the tribes of Nephthali, Zabulon, and Issachar, while Debbora judged in Mount
                           Ephraim, and Samgar in Juda. --- <I>He dwelt.</I> It is not clear whether Jabin or Sisara dwelt in <I>Haroseth,</I> but most
                           probably it was the latter, ver. 13. This city was on the northern banks of the Semechonite lake, (Calmet) surrounded with
                           "woods," as the Hebrew word signifies; (Vatable) though Bonfrere explains it "a shop, foundry, or arsenal," as if the arms
                           and chariots were made and kept here. A mixture of different idolatrous nations dwelt in it.</FONT></P><B>

                           signifies "lamps," and Barac, "thunder;" which has given rise to various conjectures, as if they were the same person. St.
                           Ambrose thinks that Debbora was a widow at this time, and the mother of Barac. But St. Jerome says there is no proof of either.
                           Others suppose that the excellence of the gift of prophecy would not permit her to cohabit with her husband. It is not unusual
                           for women to possess this gift. Mary, the sister of Moses, Holda, the blessed Virgin, the daughter of St. Philip, &amp;c.,
                           were prophetesses. The devil most commonly chose women to explain his oracles. --- <I>Judged.</I> Many deny that this word
                           is taken in the same latitude here, as when it is applied to men. The Jews exclude women from government, and Athalia was
                           only a tyrant. The Roman laws will not admit women to exercise the right of judicature. But the text, as it is explained by
                           the Fathers in general, will not permit us to refuse the prerogatives of a judge to Debbora. Her authority was not merely
                           voluntary, in consequence of the people's high opinion of her, as many would believe, with Salien, Worthington, &amp;c., (Haydock)
                           but she gave decisions which were binding on the Israelites; and she seems to have continued in the exercise of her functions
                           along with Barac, after the victory which they gained over Sisara. The government of the latter was perhaps limited to the
                           tribes which he had rescued from slavery. (Calmet) --- He is guided by her counsel, as Christian princes ought to be by their
                           spiritual superiors. (Origen) (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew, "she dwelt (or sat to judge) under the palm-tree of Debbora." "The oak of weeping," <I>allon Bacuth,</I> under which
                           Debbora, the nurse of Rebecca, was interred, was also near <I>Bethel,</I> Genesis xxxv. 8. (Haydock) --- This city was on
                           the confines of the tribes of Ephraim and of Benjamin, over which Debbora chiefly exercised her authority; and here she was
                           consulted by the people. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           There was another city of this name in Juda. (Haydock) --- Barac was of the tribe of Nephthali. (Calmet) --- <I>The Lord,</I>
                           &amp;c. Protestants translate, "hath not the Lord?" &amp;c., as if the will of God had been notified to him before. We find
                           that he makes some demur, ver. 8. (Haydock) --- <I>Thabor.</I> A city of this name was also built at the foot or on the top
                           of the mountain, and belonged to Zabulon. It is attributed to the Levites, 1 Paralipomenon vi. 77. The mountain rises in the
                           midst of a vast plain, to the height of 30 stadia, (Josephus, Jewish Wars iv. 2.; St. Jerome in Osee v. 1,) or above 3000
                           paces, "which make a league, or an hour's walk." It is inaccessible on the northern side. There was a platform two-thirds
                           as broad, at the top, where Polybius says a fortified city stood. Antiochus took possession of this strong-place, and Josephus
                           repaired the fortifications, to keep the country in subjection. It is commonly supposed the Jesus Christ was transfigured
                           on this once delightful mountain, which is now a desert. During the crusades, there was an episcopal city and a Benedictine
                           monastery here. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Cison flows through a luxuriant vale or champaign country, on the south of Mount Thabor, whence Barac came rushing down the
                           rocks and precipices upon the army of Sisara, chap. v. 15. (Calmet) --- This general was delivered into the hand of Barac,
                           to be routed, though he was afterwards slain by the hand of Jahel, ver. 9., and 21. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           St. Paul (Hebrews xi. 32,) praises the faith of Barac, so that he spoke thus out of prudence, that the people, seeing (Calmet)
                           their revered prophetess in his company, (Haydock) might not condemn the undertaking as too rash and perilous. He therefore

                           certain, however, that Barac acquired great commendations on this occasion: but if he had not been accompanied by Debbora,
                           he would not have shared the glory of the victory with her and another woman. (Haydock) --- Some suppose that Debbora speaks
                           of herself; others explain her words of Jahel. They may both be right. (Menochius) --- <I>Cedes.</I> Here the Israelites took
                           the generous resolution to throw off the yoke, and marched to seize the fort of Thabor. This motion gave the alarm to Jabin,
                           who sent his general to besiege them, and to occupy the passages of the Cison, chap. v. 18.</FONT></P><B>

                           the first settlement of the Cinites near Engaddi, when his brethren went (Calmet) into the southern parts of the tribe of
                           Juda, chap. i. 16. This is mentioned, that we might know how his wife came to be in those parts, ver. 17, &amp;c. Whether
                           he had given information to Jabin of these movements, as he was at peace with him, we cannot assert; but his being mentioned
                           in this place, might seem to insinuate as much. Hebrew, ver. 12, "they told <I>or</I> shewed Sisara," &amp;c. His wife, at
                           least, did not prove unfaithful to Israel. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Part of this torrent falls into the Mediterranean, and part into the sea of Tiberias. It rises from Mount Thabor, (which is
                           about two hours' walk, south-west of Nazareth) and from Gelboa, &amp;c. (Menochius) --- Here Sisara displayed his <I>immense</I>
                           army, if we may credit Josephus, Jonathan, &amp;c. But the Scripture only specifies 900 chariots of iron. (Calmet) --- Whence,
                           however, we may conclude that his horse and foot would be very formidable. Yet all were presently routed by the small company

                           The most dreadful storms of thunder, lightning, &amp;c., (chap. v. 20,) discomfited the enemy, while the sword of Barac (Calmet)
                           dealt death around, so that Sisara and all his army presently turned their backs, (Haydock) and the general himself being
                           stricken with a panic, leapt from his chariot, as if he thought his horses did not run fast enough. Thus Homer represents

                           Josephus allots Sisara the same number of horse and foot as he did to Jabin, whom Josue defeated and slew, chap. xi. 4. But
                           instead of 20,000 chariots, he only gives Sisara 3000, which number appears to be far too great, and unauthorized by the Scripture.

                           The women had separate tents from their husbands. Haber, it seems, was from home, and was not molested by the Chanaanites.
                           He continued neuter during this war. What then must we think of the conduct of his wife? Commentators generally justify her,
                           as the Scripture gives her great commendations, and as the family of the Cinites enjoyed the religion and privileges of the
                           Israelites. Hence this portion of it could not make a league with the enemy of God's people, to the detriment of the latter;
                           and if they did, they were bound to break it as soon, at least, as God manifested his will, that the enemy should be destroyed.
                           Jahel might however deserve the praise of fortitude, which the Scripture gives her, and yet mingle some human imperfection
                           in her manner of acting. She seems to speak with fraud, and to betray the sacred rights of hospitality; and it is doubtful
                           whether Haber himself could renounce the alliance with Jabin, (particularly if they had taken mutual oaths to observe it,
                           as was then customary) without informing him of his resolution. <I>Fides, quando promititur, etiam hosti servanda est.</I>
                           (St. Augustine, ep. i. ad Bonif.) See Grotius, Jur. iii. 19. (Calmet) --- Yet, if she told a lie, it was only an officious
                           one, (Menochius) such as Sisara desired should be told for his safety, ver. 20. (Haydock) --- It is lawful to use stratagems
                           against an enemy. (Salien, in the year of the world 2741.) See Josue ii., and viii. 4. Debbora pronounces the name of Jahel
                           to be most blessed, (chap. v. 24,) which shews that she was inspired by God to kill Sisara. If we consider her action in any
                           other light, it will certainly appear very shocking, as Rahab could not escape the accusation of treason towards her country
                           by any other means. Aod, Judith, &amp;c., who washed <I>their hands in the blood of sinners,</I> (Psalm lvii. 11,) would undoubtedly
                           have been condemned at any merely human tribunal, which would not admit the plea of inspiration. (Haydock) --- Besides this
                           secret impulse, Jahel might be acquainted with the prediction of Debbora, (ver. 9,) and with the miraculous victory which
                           encouraged her to destroy the common enemy, (Abulensis, Josephus, &amp;c.; Tirinus) the only remnant of an immense army. (Haydock)
                           --- The <I>peace</I> which subsisted between her family and the Chanaanites, was a forced one, (Tirinus) and perhaps consisted
                           only in the former being allowed to live quietly (Du Hamel) in the midst of these idolaters, whose manners they abhorred;
                           (Haydock) while the Israelites, though at a greater distance, were so severely treated even when they were so weak as to adore
                           the idols (Tirinus) of their oppressors. Thus the divine Providence was pleased to reward virtue, and to punish infidelity.
                           (Haydock) --- The Fathers consider Debbora as a figure of the Synagogue, which begins the attack against the empire of the
                           devil, while the victory is reserved for the Christian Church, represented by Jahel, a woman living among the Israelites,
                           though of a different nation, and engrafted, as it were, like the wild olive on the good olive tree. She [the Christian Church]
                           gains strength in the midst of persecutions, and, armed with the cross of Christ, destroys the captain of the worldly empire.
                           (Origen, hom v.; St. Augustine, contra Faust. xii. 31, &amp;c.) (Calmet) --- Jahel was also a figure of the blessed Virgin,
                           who crushed the serpent's head. (Worthington) [Genesis iii. 15]</FONT></P><B>

                           Such nails were used to fasten down the skins, of which the tent was composed. (Calmet) --- This resembled a stake, though
                           Josephus says it was made of iron. (Menochius) --- <I>And died.</I> Thus he met a more ignoble fate, which would be more hateful
                           to a warrior. Abimelech ordered his armour-bearer to kill him, that it might not be said that he had fallen by the hand of
                           a woman, chap. ix. 54. Extreme fatigue, and the will of Providence, caused Sisara to fall asleep so soon. How many, like him,
