                           He brings many reasons to convince them of the resurrection. 1. If <I>there be no resurrection</I> for others, <I>Christ is
                           not risen again:</I> but his resurrection (as he tells them ver. 4) was foretold <I>in the Scriptures.</I> 2. <I>And if Christ
                           be not risen again,...your faith is also in vain,</I> this being one of the chief articles of your belief. 3. We shall be
                           found guilty of lies and impostures; and yet we have confirmed this doctrine by many miracles. 4. It would follow that you
                           are not freed from your <I>sins;</I> i.e. unless Christ, by his resurrection, has triumphed over sin and death. 5. Without
                           a resurrection we Christians, who live under self-denials and persecutions, would be the most miserable of all men, neither
                           happy in this world nor in the next, for the happiness of the soul requires also a happy resurrection of the body. 6. Christ
                           is <I>the first-fruits,</I> and the first begotten of the dead, of those <I>who have slept:</I> and by his being the first-fruits,
                           it must be supposed that others also will rise after him. 7. As death came by the first man, (<I>Adam</I>) so the second man
                           (Christ) came to repair the death of men, both as to body and soul; and without Christ's resurrection, both the souls of men
                           have remained dead in their original sins, and their bodies shall not rise again. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>deliver up his kingdom,</I> as to this world, over all men, over the devil and his apostate angels, signified by <I>principalities</I>

                           is as it were the <I>last enemy</I> of his elect. At the general resurrection, Christ will present these elect to his heavenly
                           Father, as the fruits of his victory over sin and death; and though as man he came to suffer and die, and was also made <I>subject</I>

                           are baptized for the dead.</I>[1] He still brings other proofs of the resurrection. This is a hard place, and the words are
                           differently expounded. 1. Several late interpreters understand a metaphorical baptism, and that to be <I>baptized for the
                           dead,</I> is to undertake self-denials, mortifications, and works of penance, in hopes of a happy resurrection; and this exposition
                           agrees with what follows, of <I>being exposed to dangers every hour,</I> of <I>dying daily,</I> &amp;c. But if this had been
                           the apostle's meaning, he would rather have said, Who baptize themselves. Besides, this exposition is not so much as mentioned
                           in any of the ancient interpreters. 2. Some think that St. Paul tells the Corinthians that they ought not to question the
                           resurrection of the dead, who had a custom among them, if any one died without baptism, to baptize another that was living
                           for him; and this they did, fancying that such a baptism would be profitable to the dead person, in order to a happy resurrection.
                           Tertullian mentions this custom in one or two places, and also St. Chrysostom on this place. But it does not seem probable
                           that St. Paul would bring any argument of the resurrection from a custom which he himself could not approve, nor was ever
                           approved in the Church. 3. St. Chrysostom and the Greek interpreters, who generally follow him, expound these words, <I>who
                           are baptized for the dead,</I> as if it were the same as to say, who receive baptism with hopes that they themselves, and
                           all the dead, will rise again; and therefore make a profession, when they are baptized, that they believe the resurrection.
                           So that St. Paul here brings this proof among others, that they who have been made Christians, and continue Christians, cannot
                           call in question the resurrection, which they professed to believe in their creed at their baptism, the creed being always
                           repeated before they were baptized. 4. Others, by being <I>baptized for the dead,</I> understand those who begged and called
                           for baptism when they were in danger of death, and would by no means go out of this world without being baptized, hoping thereby
                           to have a happy resurrection of their bodies; so that to be baptized for the dead is the same as on the account of the state
                           of the dead, which they were entering into. See St. Epiphanius, hær. viii. p. 114. Edit Petavii. (Witham) Some think the apostle
                           here alludes to a ceremony then in use: but others, more probably, to the prayers and penitential labours performed by the
                           primitive Christians for the souls of the faithful departed: or to the baptism of afflictions and sufferings undergone for
                           sinners spiritually dead. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           that at Ephesus he was exposed to beasts in the amphitheatre. (Witham) --- Interpreters are divided upon this passage. Calmet
                           is of opinion that St. Paul was exposed in the amphitheatre at Ephesus, but was secured from all injury by the all-powerful
                           hand of God: he produces the testimony of St. Chrysostom, Theo., St. Ambrose, St. Cyprian, and St. Hilary, all of whom understand
                           this passage in the literal sense. Nicephorus cites a book, entitled <I>The Travels of St. Paul,</I> in confirmation of this
                           fact, wherein (he informs us) there is a long account of this transaction. St. Jerome says, that St. Paul was condemned by
                           the governor of Ephesus to be devoured by beasts. Estius seems to maintain the same opinion as Challoner. To inspirit us to
                           combat, it is advisable to turn our eyes frequently to a future life. The brevity of the present is a principle common to
                           the morality of Jesus Christ, and to that of Epicurus. But how contrary are the conclusions! Why should we not rather say:
                           "Let us watch, and fast, and pray, and do penance, for to-morrow we die; and after that, judgment." --- <I>Let us eat and
                           drink,</I> &amp;c. That is, if we did not believe that we were to rise again from the dead, we might live like the impious
                           and wicked, who have no belief in the resurrection. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           reduces them to these two questions: how is it possible for them to rise? and in what manner, or with what qualities, will
                           they rise? To shew the possibility, he brings the example of a grain of wheat, or of any seeds, which must be corrupted, and
                           die as it were in the ground, and then is quite changed, comes up with <I>a blade,</I> a stalk, and an ear quite different
                           from what it was when sown, and yet comes to be wheat again, or to be a tree that produces the same kind of fruit: so God
                           can raise <I>our bodies as he pleaseth.</I> He also tells them that there are very different bodies, <I>terrestrial,</I> and
                           <I>celestial,</I> some more, some less glorious, differing in beauty and other qualities, as God pleaseth. As the <I>sun</I>
                           is brighter than the <I>moon,</I> and as one <I>star</I> is <I>brighter</I> than another, so shall it be at the general resurrection.
                           But all the bodies of the elect shall be happily changed to a state <I>of incorruption.</I> (ver. 42.) Here the bodies even
                           of the just are subject to corruption, to decay, liable to death, but they shall then rise to a state of incorruptibility
                           and immortality: And so he answers the second question, that here every one's body is a weak, sensual, <I>animal</I> body,
                           clogged with many imperfections, like that of Adam after he had sinned; but at the resurrection, the bodies of the saints
                           shall be spiritual bodies, blessed with all the perfections and qualities of a glorified body, like to that of Christ after
                           he was risen. --- St. Paul also, comparing the <I>first man</I> (<I>Adam</I>) with Christ, whom he calls the second or the
                           <I>last Adam,</I> (ver. 45) says that the first Adam was made a <I>living soul,</I> (i.e. a living animal, or a living creature,
                           with a life and a body that required to be supported with corporal food) but that Christ was made a <I>quickening Spirit:</I>
                           he means, that though he had a true mortal body by his nativity of his Virgin Mother, yet that by his resurrection he had
                           a glorified body, immortal, that needed no corporal food, and that he would also give such spiritual and immortal bodies to
                           those whom he should make partakers of his glory. --- <I>But not first that which is spiritual,</I> &amp;c. (ver. 46) that
                           is, both in Adam and in us, and even in Christ, the body was first mortal, which should afterwards be made spiritual and immortal
                           by a happy resurrection. --- <I>The first</I> Adam (ver. 47) <I>was of the earth, earthly,</I> made of clay, and with such
                           a body as could die, <I>but the second man</I> (Christ) was <I>from heaven, heavenly:</I> not that he took a body from heaven,
                           as some ancient heretics pretended, but he was heavenly not only because he was the Son of God, but in this place he seems
                           to be called heavenly even as to his body, after his resurrection, his body being then become spiritual and immortal. ---
                           <I>Such as is the earthly</I> man, &amp;c. (ver. 48) that is, as the first man, Adam, was earthly by his earthly and mortal
                           body, so were we and all his posterity <I>earthly;</I> but such <I>as the heavenly</I> man, Christ, <I>was heavenly,</I> and
                           rose with a heavenly and immortal body; so shall all those be heavenly, to whom he shall give a spiritual, a heavenly, and
                           an immortal body at their happy resurrection. --- <I>Therefore,</I> (ver. 49) <I>as we have borne the image of the earthly</I>
                           man, (that is, have been made mortal, and also by sin subject to the corrupt inclinations of this mortal body) <I>so let us
                           bear also the image of the heavenly</I> one, by a new life imitating Christ, by which means we shall be glorified with him,
                           both as to soul and body. --- <I>Now this I say,</I> and admonish you, <I>brethren,</I> (ver. 50) <I>that flesh and blood
                           cannot possess the kingdom of God;</I> i.e. those that lead a sensual and carnal life, nor the corruption of sin, deserve
                           the state of incorruption in glory. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>
