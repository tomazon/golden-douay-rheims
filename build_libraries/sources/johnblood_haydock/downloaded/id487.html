                           seized the opportunity of winnowing his barley; so that, at an early hour, he gave Ruth six measures, and retired to rest,
                           beside some of the remaining sheaves (Calmet) in an adjoining apartment, erected for the protection of the reapers during
                           the great heats, and to contain the corn in case of a shower. (Columella, i. 7. and ii. 51.) This shade was probably in the
                           same field where Ruth had been gleaning. (Calmet) --- She might lawfully seize this opportunity (Haydock) to obtain an honest

                           bed at the feet, to shew their submission. (Calmet) --- Ruth was conducted on this occasion by a superior Being, who gave
                           success to her undertaking, and disposed the mind of Booz (Theodoret) to grant her just claim. It was according to the law
                           of Moses, that a widow might demand in marriage the next kinsman of her deceased husband, if she had no children by him. Ruth
                           considered Booz in this light. (Haydock) --- She was not actuated by a love of pleasure, as the latter was convinced, otherwise
                           she would have desired to marry some young man, (Calmet) in her own country, ver. 10. Both parties would probably have their
                           clothes on among the straw, so that there would be less danger; though, if their virtue had not been very constant, (Haydock)
                           the situation was no doubt sufficiently perilous, and in other circumstances could not have been tolerated. (Calmet) --- We
                           must also remember, that clandestine marriages were not then forbidden. (Salien) --- That same night they might have married,
                           had not another's being nearer akin proved an obstacle; (Tirinus) so that Booz could not have claimed the inheritance of Elimelech,
                           though he might have taken Ruth to wife. By deferring another day he obtained both. (Haydock) --- Lyranus thinks Ruth could
                           be excused only by ignorance, in thus exposing herself to danger, and that Noemi was guilty of a grievous sin, in giving her
                           such advice. But they both had the purest views, seeking only an honest marriage, by arts which were not blamable. See St.
                           Thomas Aquinas, 2. 2. q. 154., and 169., and Cajetan. (Tirinus) --- Noemi was well assured of the virtue of both parties,
                           and followed the directions of the Holy Spirit, (Calmet) as the event shewed. (Worthington) --- Dr. Watson justly reproves
                           the censure of Paine, who calls Ruth, "a strolling country girl, creeping slily to bed to her cousin," and exclaims, "pretty
                           stuff indeed to be called the word of God!" But in correcting this impertinent remark, he seems to allow that some things
                           have been inserted in the Scriptures by human authority, so as not to be the word of God. This concession is more dangerous
                           than the censure of Paine, and the quotation from St. Augustine by no means countenances it, as it barely insinuates that
                           an express <I>revelation</I> was not requisite to insert some things, which the authors might know by other means. The holy
                           father never doubted but every part of Scripture was equally inspired, and to be received without the smallest hesitation.
                           What Dr. Law, and other such "good Christians," might think, does not regard us. (Haydock) --- "As a person imploring protection,
                           Ruth laid herself down at the foot of an aged kinsman's bed, and she rose up with as much innocence as she laid herself down.
                           She was afterwards married to Booz, and reputed by all her neighbours as a virtuous woman; and they were more likely to know
                           her character than you are. Whoever reads the Book of Ruth, bearing in mind the simplicity of ancient manners, will find it
                           an interesting story of a poor young woman," &amp;c. (Watson, let. 4.) --- <I>Must do. </I>She trusted to the superior wisdom
                           of Booz, knowing perhaps that he was not absolutely the nearest relation, but being convinced, as the event proved, that the
                           other would not consent to marry Ruth on the conditions specified by the law. (Salien, A. 2810.[in the year of the world 2810.])</FONT></P>

                           xxii. 80. Some think that she only asked for protection. The custom of the husband, stretching a part of his garment over

                           so that Ruth might conveniently carry the barley in it. --- <I>Measures</I> is not in [the] Hebrew or Septuagint. Most people
                           supply ephi. St. Jerome, who has translated six bushels, (allowing three to the ephi; chap. ii. 17,) has understood that Booz
                           gave Ruth two ephi. If we explain it of six ephi, the burden would be great enough, consisting of 180 pints or pounds of barley.
                           Bonfrere would supply six gomers, each of which consisted of only the tenth part of the ephi, or three pints, in all 18. But
                           such a present seems too inconsiderable. We may therefore stick to St. Jerome, whose six measures (Calmet--- <I>modios, </I>bushels;
                           Haydock.) make about 60 pints; (Calmet) or, according to others, 160 pounds, which, though heavy, a woman might carry. The
                           Septuagint insinuate, that Ruth carried the barley in her apron. (Menochius) --- <I>And. </I>Hebrew, "he <I>went.</I>" But
                           the text is probably corrupted. (Calmet)</FONT></FONT></P><B>
