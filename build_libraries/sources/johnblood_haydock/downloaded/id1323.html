                           up, by reason of the persecutions he had lately met with. See chap. xxvi. (Challoner) --- If he had been confined, as Grotius
                           asserts, the king would easily have found him. (Calmet) --- He and Baruch retired to some secret place, as most priests (Worthington)
                           did formerly in England, (Haydock) that they might better exercise their functions than they could do in the hands of the

                           represents (Calmet) "supplications," as daughters of Jupiter, lame, and with eyes averted, (Iliad ix.) to shew how we ought
                           to pray. Jeremias finds means to instruct the people: the <i>word of God is not bound,</i> 2 Timothy ii. 9. (Calmet) --- As
                           many refused to hear his discourses, God ordered him to write what might be a perpetual warning and reproach, or testimony
                           against them. (Worthington)</font></p><b>
