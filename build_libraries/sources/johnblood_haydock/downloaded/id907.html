                           <i>Tell him: Thou shalt recover.</i> By these words the prophet signified that the king's disease was not mortal: and that
                           he would recover, if no violence were used. Or he might only express himself in this manner, by way of giving Hazael to understand
                           that he knew both what he would say and do; that he would indeed tell the king he should recover, but would be himself the
                           instrument of his death. (Challoner) -- The imperative is often used for the future tense. (Gloss iii. 3.) (John ii. 19.)
                           The present Hebrew reads, "Thou shalt not live: for," &amp;c., which removes the difficulty. But the Chaldean, Septuagint,
                           Syriac, &amp;c., agree with the Vulgate, (Calmet) as the Protestant version also does. "Thou mayst certainly recover, howbeit
                           the Lord," &amp;c. (Haydock) --- <i>Lo,</i> "not," in the Hebrew text, seems however preferable to the marginal reading, <i>lu,</i>
                           "to him." This mistake has been sometimes made elsewhere, and ought to be carefully examined. (Kennicott, 1 Paralipomenon
                           xi. 20.)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Blush.</i> This may be referred either to Hazael, who was astonished at the words and looks of the prophet, (Haydock) or
                           to Eliseus. (Menochius) --- Septuagint Complutensian, "and Hazael stood before his face, and he displayed the presents before
                           him, till he blushed, and the," &amp;c. Though this has the appearance of a gloss, it is perhaps most conformable to the Hebrew
                           and to an ancient Greek version. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed."</font></p><b>

                           caused by Hazael's malice. (Calmet) --- He might pretend that the wet cloth would give Benadad refreshment. (Haydock) ---
                           But it would bring on present death, with most exquisite torture. (Tirinus) --- The names of both these kings were in great
                           veneration among the Syrians, who paid them divine honours. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] ix. 4.) --- Perhaps they might not know

                           <i>Twenty.</i> In 2 Paralipomenon xxii. 2., we read <i>forty,</i> by mistake of the transcribers, as Ochozias, (Joachaz, or
                           Azarias, 2 Paralipomenon xxi. 17.) would thus be older than his father, who died at the age of forty, 2 Paralipomenon xxi.
                           20. All the original versions, and many copies of the Septuagint read "twenty-two" in both passages; and those who would admit
                           no mistake, are forced to have recourse to explanations which can give no satisfaction. De Dieu would include in the reign
                           of Ochozias the six years of Athalia's usurpation, and the thirteen of Joas, during his minority. Others would date from the
                           separation of the two kingdoms, &amp;c. But would the Holy Ghost cause the same fact to be recorded in two places in such
                           a different manner? The best chronologists acknowledge a mistake in the Hebrew text of Paralipomenon. (Cajetan; Salien; Petau;
                           Tirinus, &amp;c.; Calmet) as the letters which denote these numbers are not unlike (Mariana:) <i>c</i> (20) might easily be
                           exchanged for <i>m</i> (40.) (Haydock) --- <i>Daughter.</i> That is, grand-daughter; for she was daughter of Achab, son of
                           Amri, ver. 18., (Challoner) unless she was only adopted by Achab. (Worthington)</font></p><b>
