                           <i>And.</i> Hebrew inserts here the conclusion of the last verse, whence some would infer that Samuel told the Israelites
                           to make war upon the Philistines. But as it turned out so ill, this would have tended to discredit him; and we find that the
                           Philistines were the aggressors. --- <i>Days.</i>&nbsp;This war took place immediately after the threats denounced to Heli;
                           (Sararius) or according to Usher, and the best chronologists, about 27 years after that event. (Calmet) --- The addition of
                           the Septuagint seems to insinuate, that the sons of Heli persevered for a long time in their wicked course, chap. iii. 20.
                           (Haydock) --- Josephus says that Phinees was his father's coadjutor. --- Salien observes that this must be considered as a
                           fresh blot in the character of the latter, since he ought to have delivered the delinquents up to execution, Deuteronomy xxi.
                           21. Tirin[Tirinus], on the contrary, adduces the power of his sons, and the debilitated state of Heli, to excuse his neglect.
                           (Haydock) --- <i>Help.</i> In Hebrew <i>Eben-ezer;</i> so called, from the <i>help</i> which the Lord was pleased afterwards
                           to give to his people, Israel, in that place, by the prayers of Samuel, chap. vii. 12., (Challoner) about 21 years afterwards.

                           his blindness and great age. --- <i>Enemies.</i> All nations attribute much to the exterior marks of religion. The Israelites
                           had witnessed the victories which had been obtained while the ark was present, Josue vi. 4. See Numbers xiv. 45. But they
                           ought to have considered, that their infidelity rendered them unworthy of the divine protection; and that God was more displeased
                           at their profanations, than at the indignity to which the sacred vessels would be exposed. He would know how to vindicate
                           his own honour and glory. The symbols of religion were thus carried in the army, by the Persians, &amp;c. (Herodotus vii.)
                           --- The Romans regarded their standards as so many deities. (Halicar. vi.) See 2 Kings vi. 21., and 2 Paralipomenon xiii.
                           8. (Calmet) --- The confidence which the Israelites placed in the ark was commendable, but their sins deserved to be punished.

                           <i>Ark.</i> On this extraordinary emergency they thought it lawful. (Abulensis, q. 6.) --- They easily obtained the consent
                           of Heli; and his sons went to take it down, and to attend it to the army, as he was incapable of doing duty. We know not what
                           ceremonies were used, nor whether the brothers acted as high priests alternately. (Calmet) --- <i>Cherubim.</i> The Scripture
                           often represents God in this manner, Exodus xxv. 22., Psalm xvii. 10., and Ezechiel x. 1. The commonality of the Jews attributed
                           bodies to the angels, but to denote that they were not like those with which we are acquainted, they called them cherubim,
                           or complex and unusual figures. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           or magnificent, was given by the Philistines to Dagon, whom they styled Atergatis. (Calmet) --- Septuagint <i><u>stereon</u>,</i>

                           exposed themselves to fight against the high God. But they looked upon him in no other light than their own contemptible idols.

                           lest God should have abandoned them. So many dismal circumstances oppressing the heart of Heli, he fainted away, and falling
                           backwards, expired. (Haydock) --- The Scripture takes notice of his great age, that we might not think that he killed himself

                           of God himself, when by sin they have drove him out of their souls? (Challoner) --- The ark is often called the glory of Israel,
                           Isaias lxiv. 21., and Psalm xxv. 8. Ichabod might remind the people that the greatest loss had been sustained by them, as
                           well as by his family. His mother had both in view the <i>ark,</i> Heli, and Phinees, <i>her husband,</i> (Haydock) when she
                           exclaimed, <i>icabod,</i> "Woe! or, Alas! the glory." (Mendoza) --- The Scripture does not mention Ophni's posterity. But
                           besides this posthumous son, Phinees had one elder, who now succeeded Heli in the pontificate, (Chap. xiv. 3.; Josephus; Salien,
                           the year of the world 2940, the year before Christ 1113,) while Samuel took possession of the civil administration, and almost
                           totally eclipsed the glory of Achitob. Many of the Fathers have even looked upon him as the high priest. But he was only a
                           Levite, though, by dispensation, he acted sometimes as an extraordinary priest. (St. Jerome, contra Jov. i., and in 1 Cor.)
                           He reduced the people to a sense of their duty, and taught them to trust in the true God alone, and they would be protected,
                           though deprived of the ark. This was also presently restored to them. (Haydock)</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 And put their army in array against Israel. And when they had joined

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 And the people returned to the camp: and the ancients of Israel said:

                                    Silo, and let it come in the midst of us, that it may save us from the hand of our enemies.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 So the people sent to Silo, and they brought from thence the ark of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And the Philistines were afraid, saying: God is come into the camp.
                                    And sighing, they said:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 Woe to us: for there was no such great joy yesterday, and the day before:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 So the Philistines fought, and Israel was overthrown, and every man

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Silo

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And when he was come, Heli sat upon a stool over-against the way,
                                    watching. For his heart was fearful for the ark of God. And when the man was come into the city, he told it: and all the city
                                    cried out.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And Heli heard the noise of the cry, and he said: What meaneth the
                                    noise of this uproar? But he made haste, and came, and told Heli.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Now Heli was ninety and eight years old, and his eyes were dim, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And he said to Heli: I am he that came from the battle, and have fled
                                    out of the field this day. And he said to him: What is there done, my son?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And he that brought the news answered, and said: Israel is fled before

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinees, was big with child,

                                    she bowed herself and fell in labour: for her pains came upon her on a sudden.</font></p>
