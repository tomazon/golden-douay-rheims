                           This is purely historical, taken from 4 Kings xxiv. 18., &amp;c. Many doubt with reason the Jeremias inserted it, as he could
                           not well be alive at the time when Joakim was honoured, ver. 31. If he had written both this and the Book of Kings, the variations
                           which we here discover would not be seen. It seems, therefore, that Esdras or some other has inserted it, to explain the fall
                           of Jerusalem and the lamentations; as a similar addition has been made to Isaias, chap. xxxvi., &amp;c. See Grotius. (Calmet)

                                    <p>1 Sedecias *was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and the name
                                    of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremias, of Lobna.</p>
                                    <p>2 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that Joakim had done.</p>
                                    <p>3 For the wrath of the Lord was against Jerusalem, and against Juda, till he cast them out from his presence; and Sedecias
                                    revolted from the king of Babylon.</p>
                                    <p>4 *And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that Nabuchodonosor,
                                    the king of Babylon, came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and they besieged it, and built forts against it round
                                    about.</p>
                                    <p>5 And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Sedecias.</p>
                                    <p>6 And in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a famine overpowered the city; and there was no food for the people
                                    of the land.</p>
                                    <p>7 And the city was broken up, and the men of war fled, and went out of the city in the night by the way of the gate that
                                    is between the two walls, and leadeth to the king's garden, (the Chaldeans besieging the city round about) and they went by
                                    the way that leadeth to the wilderness.</p>
                                    <p>8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king; and they overtook Sedecias in the desert which is near Jericho:
                                    and all his companions were scattered from him.</p>
                                    <p>9 And when they had taken the king, they carried him to the king of Babylon, to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath;
                                    and he gave judgment upon him.</p>
                                    <p>10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias before his eyes; and he slew all the princes of Juda, in Reblatha.</p>
                                    <p>11 And he put out the eyes of Sedecias, and bound him with fetters, and the king of Babylon brought him into Babylon, and
                                    he put him in prison till the day of his death.</p>
                                    <p>12 And in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, the same is the nineteenth year of Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon,
                                    came Nabuzardan, the general of the army, who stood before the king of Babylon, in Jerusalem.</p>
                                    <p>13 And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house he
                                    burnt with fire.</p>
                                    <p>14 And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the general, broke down all the wall of Jerusalem, round about.</p>
                                    <p>15 But Nabuzardan, the general, carried away captives some of the poor people, and of the rest of the common sort, who
                                    remained in the city, and of the fugitives that were fled over to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</p>
                                    <p>16 But of the poor of the land, Nabuzardan, the general, left some for vine-dressers, and for husbandmen.</p>
                                    <p>17 The Chaldeans also broke in pieces the brazen pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea
                                    of brass that was in the house of the Lord: and they carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</p>
                                    <p>18 And they took the cauldrons, and the flesh-hooks, and the psalteries, and the bowls, and the little mortars, and all
                                    the brazen vessels that had been used in the ministry: and</p>
                                    <p>19 The general took away the pitchers, and the censers, and the pots, and the basins, and the candlesticks, and the mortars,
                                    and the cups; as many as were of gold, in gold; and as many as were of silver, in silver:</p>
                                    <p>20 And the two pillars, and one sea, and twelve oxen of brass that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in
                                    the house of the Lord: there was no weight of the brass of all these vessels.</p>
                                    <p>21 And concerning the pillars, one pillar was eighteen cubits high, and a cord of twelve cubits compassed it about; but
                                    the thickness thereof was four fingers, and it was hollow within.</p>
                                    <p>22 And chaptrels of brass were upon both: and the height of one chaptrel was five cubits; and net-work, and pomegranates
                                    were upon the chaptrels round about, all of brass. The same of the second pillar, and the pomegranates.</p>
                                    <p>23 And there were ninety-six pomegranates hanging down; and the pomegranates, being a hundred in all, were compassed with
                                    net-work.</p>
                                    <p>24 And the general took Saraias the chief priest, and Sophonias, the second priest, and the three keepers of the entry.</p>
                                    <p>25 He also took out of the city, one eunuch, that was chief over the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the
                                    king's person, that were found in the city; and a scribe, an officer of the army, who exercised the young soldiers; and threescore
                                    men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.</p>
                                    <p>26 And Nabuzardan, the general, took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon, to Reblatha.</p>
                                    <p>27 And the king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death, in Reblatha, in the land of Emath: and Juda was carried
                                    away captive out of his land.</p>
                                    <p>28 This is the people whom Nabuchodonosor carried away captive: In the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews.</p>
                                    <p>29 In the eighteenth year of Nabuchodonosor, eight hundred and thirty-two souls from Jerusalem.</p>
                                    <p>30 In the three and twentieth year of Nabuchodonosor, Nabuzardan, the general, carried away of the Jews, seven hundred
                                    <i>and </i>forty-five souls. So all the souls were four thousand six hundred.</p>
                                    <p>31 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth *year of the captivity of Joachin, king of Juda, in the twelfth month,
                                    the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach, king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the
                                    head of Joachin, king of Juda, and brought him forth out of prison.</p>
                                    <p>32 And he spoke kindly to him, and he set his throne above the thrones of the kings that were with him in Babylon.</p>
                                    <p>33 And he changed his prison-garments, and he eat bread before him always all the days of his life.</p>
                                    <p>34 And for his diet a continual provision was allowed him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion, until the day of
                                    his death, all the days of his life.</p>
