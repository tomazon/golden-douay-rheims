                           From the change of the narration to the first person again, it would appear St. Luke had rejoined the apostle. This writer
                           modestly omits the reason of his accompanying St. Paul, who tells us it was at his own request, (2 Corinthians viii. 19.)
                           that no suspicion might be entertained that he applied improperly the money, which he was commissioned to carry to the distressed
                           brethren in Jerusalem. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           as to the manner of keeping one of God's ten commandments) was made by the Church. --- <I>To break bread,</I> meaning the
                           blessed sacrament, as it is commonly expounded. (Witham) --- St. Paul did here break bread on a Sunday, as it is broken in
                           the sacrament of the body of Christ, and delivered a discourse to the people, both before and after the celebration of the

                           This accident, which gave occasion to a great miracle, was ordained by the particular providence of God, in order to confirm
                           the preaching of St. Paul, and to fix more deeply in the hearts of his disciples the words of their dear Master, who was just
                           going to leave them. Admire likewise the apostle's solicitude for his neighbour's salvation, in prolonging his instructions
