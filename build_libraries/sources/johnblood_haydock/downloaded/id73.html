                           their lodging from house to house; but while they staid in a town, to remain in the same house. And though the negative be
                           here omitted in the Greek, interpreters bring it to the same, by telling us that the sense is, <I>stay here, </I>and <I>depart

                           from the dead.</I> Herod was perplexed and in suspense about the report, that it was John [the Baptist] that was risen from
                           the dead. ... From this it appears, that some of the Jews, and Herod himself, believed in some kind of metempsychosis, or
                           transmigration of souls. Josephus says, (Antiquities lib. xviii, chap. 2.) that the Pharisees believed the soul to be immortal;
                           and after death, to depart to some subterraneous places, where they received the recompense of good, or evil, according to
                           their actions. There the souls of the wicked remain for ever, without the power of departing thence. The souls of the good
                           sometimes returned, and entered other bodies. Herod probably thought that the soul of John the Baptist was united to that
                           of Christ, in the same body, and was thence enabled to perform new and more extraordinary functions. Such were the reveries
                           of some of the Rabbins; who, as St. Jerome remarks, abused the passages of the gospel we are now explaining, in support of
                           this Pythagorean doctrine. Most of the Jews believed the true doctrine of the resurrection, viz. that of the body; which must
                           one day be renewed to life by the same soul which now animates it: and this is the doctrine of faith and of the Church, which
                           she teaches you from both the Old and New Testament, instead of that transmigration of souls, which has no foundation or appearance
                           of truth. It is probable that this error was widely diffused among the Jews, in our Saviour's time. It was a doctrine suited
                           to the taste of the Orientals. Some think they can see traces of it in the history of Elias. That prophet being taken away,
                           and the Jews seeing Eliseus perform the same miracles, said, that the spirit of Elias had rested on him. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           (Witham) --- It is not here said, as some interpreters have believed, that his journey to Jerusalem was the last of his life,
                           in which he was crucified. It appears from the context, that there were still many months before the death of Christ, and
                           that this journey was probably for the feast of Pentecost. But that year was the last of the life of Jesus Christ and he already
                           knew the dispositions of the Jews, and what was to befall him shortly. These words, <I>he set his face,</I> are often used
                           in Scripture for obstinacy and hardness in evil. (Proverbs vii. 13; xxi. 29; Jeremias xlii. 15. &amp;c.) But we may likewise
                           take them to signify a strong resolution, and intrepid and inflexible firmness, to perform what you have resolved. Jesus Christ
                           shewed by his air, by his conduct and discourse, that notwithstanding the malice of his enemies, he was determined to go to
                           Jerusalem. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           reprehensible in his person. There appears likewise great presumption in his conduct, as he did not petition to be admitted,
                           as other Jews did, but seems to claim the honour of the apostleship; an honour which none must assume, but such as are called

                           Immediately Eliseus quits his plough, runs with Elias's permission to bid adieu to his father and mother, sacrifices two of
                           his oxen, roasts them with the wood of the plough, and joins the company of the prophets. Jesus Christ wishes that all who

                                    and his raiment became white and glittering.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And behold two men were talking with him. And they were Moses and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 Appearing in majesty: and they spoke of his decease, which he was

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 But Peter, and they that were with him, were heavy with sleep. And
                                    awaking, they saw his majesty, and the two men that stood with him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And it came to pass, that as they were departing from him, Peter saith
                                    to Jesus: Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one
                                    for Elias: not knowing what he said.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And as he spoke these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed
                                    them: and they were afraid, when they entered into the cloud.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And a voice came out of the cloud, saying: *This is my beloved Son,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And whilst the voice was uttered, Jesus was found alone. And they
                                    held their peace, and told no man in those days any of these things which they had seen.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 And it came to pass, that on the day following, when they came down
                                    from the mountain, there met him a great multitude.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 *And behold a man, among the crowd, cried out, saying: Master, I beseech

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 And lo, a spirit seizeth him, and he suddenly crieth out, and he throweth

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 And I desired thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 And Jesus answering, said: O faithless and perverse generation, how

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 And as he was approaching, the devil threw him down and tore him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and cured the boy, and restored

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 And all were astonished at the mighty power of God: but while they
                                    all wondered at all the things he did, he said to his disciples: Lay you up in your hearts these words: for it shall come
                                    to pass, that the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">45 But they understood not this word, and it was hid from them, so that
                                    they perceived it not. And they were afraid to ask him concerning this word.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">46 *And there entered a thought into them, which of them should be greater.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">47 But Jesus seeing the thoughts of their heart, took a child, and set
                                    him by him,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">48 And said to them: Whosoever shall receive this child in my name, receiveth
                                    me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth him that sent me. For he that is the least among you all, he is the greatest.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">49 And John answering, said: Master, we saw&nbsp;one casting out devils

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">50 And Jesus said to him: Forbid <i>him </i>not: for he that is not against

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">52 And he sent messengers before his face: and going, they entered into

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">53 And they received him not, because his face was of one going to Jerusalem.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">55 And turning, he rebuked them, saying: You know not of what spirit
