                           of prophecy had left him; and, though he was clear-sighted, and equitable enough to punish the faults of others, he could
                           not discern his own picture, till Nathan had removed the veil. The prophet acted with the utmost prudence, and did not condemn
                           the king till he had pronounced sentence on himself. It is commonly supposed that the interview was private. St. Chrysostom
                           believes that the chief lords of the court were present; which would enhance the discretion of Nathan, as well as David's

                           Literally, "made" almost, in the same sense, as God threatened to do, what was effected by Absalom, ver. 12. David did not
                           co-operate with the malice of infidels; but he was responsible for it: in as much as he had committed an unlawful action,
                           which gave them occasion to blaspheme God, as if he had not been able to foresee this scandalous transaction. Thus God and
                           religion are often vilified, on account of the misconduct of those who have the happiness to be well informed, but do not
                           live up to their profession: but this mode of argumentation is very fallacious and uncandid. It ought, however, to be a caution
                           to the servants of the true God, never to do any thing which may have such fatal consequences; and alienate the minds of weak
                           men from the truth. --- <I>Die.</I> Thus infidels would see, that God did not suffer David to pass quite unpunished. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           which God had for him; but affords no proof of his predestination to glory, of which there is too much reason to doubt. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           with waters. (Challoner) See chap. v. 8. --- The Hebrew in the preceding verse seems to insinuate, (Haydock) that "he had
                           taken the royal city." But he was only on the point of doing it, or had, perhaps, made himself master of some part of it.
                           Here the Hebrew, "I have taken," may be explained in the same sense, unless <I>the city of waters</I> were the lower part
                           of Rabbath, lying on the Jaboc. Junius translates, "He cut off the waters, which entered the city;" and Josephus favours this
                           explanation. It seems the siege lasted about two years. (Calmet) --- Antiochus took this city, by depriving the inhabitants

                           of the idols on Chanaan, but not of other nations. This crown might be worth a talent, on account of the gold and precious
                           stones; (1 Paralipomenon xx. 2.; Sanchez; Bochart,) or it might weigh so much as almost 87 pounds, (Calmet) or above 113 pounds
                           English. (Haydock) --- Such immence crowns were sometimes suspended for ornament, over the throne; as Benjamin of Tudela says
                           was done by the emperor Commenes. Pliny describes one of nine pounds; and Athenæus (v. 8,) another of 80 cubits, or 40 yards
                           (Haydock) in circumference. (Calmet) --- The idol, or the king of Ammon, (Menochius) might have one of the like nature, suspended.

                           know not the motives which might have actuated him to treat his enemy with such severity. The Ammonites had probably exercised
                           similar cruelties on his subjects. See 1 Kings xi. 2., and Amos i. 13. (Calmet) --- They had shamefully violated the law of

                           though he was barbarous and vindictive, we need not condemn him on this occasion, no more than his master; as we are not to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And the ancients of his house came to make him rise from the ground:

                                    to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how much more will he afflict himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?</font></p>
