                           The Rabbins say, by being strangled, when nothing farther is added: but if the following addition be made, stoning is understood.
                           But their authority is not of much weight, and is contradicted, ver. 2. Stoning was the most usual method of putting to death
                           in the days of Moses, and is commonly meant; or perhaps the judges might determine the mode of execution. --- <I>Upon him.</I>
                           He deserves to die. He can blame no other. See Matthew xxvii. 25. (Calmet) --- For greater infamy, the person to be stoned
                           or hung, was stripped of his clothes. (Tirinus) --- The punishment of lapidation (ver. 2,) seems to be designed for the following
                           crimes, as it was for adultery, Deuteronomy xxii. 24. (Menochius) (John viii. 5.)</FONT></P><B>

                           wife away, and if he then retained her, he was esteemed <I>a fool,</I> Proverbs xviii. 23. But more witnesses were requisite
                           before she could be put to death. They put their hands on the heads of the guilty, thus taking their blood upon themselves,
                           if they accused them wrongfully. Solon allowed the husband to kill the adulterer. The woman was not permitted to wear any
                           ornaments, or to enter any temple afterwards. If she did, any one might tear her clothes, and beat, but not kill her.</FONT></P><B>
