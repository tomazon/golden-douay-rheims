                           <I>For the kingdom.</I> The participle <I>for,</I> is found in the Greek, and connects the present parable with the last verse
                           of the preceding chapter: indeed it is a comment on that text, and describes to us the gospel dispensation. Thus the conduct
                           of God in the choice he makes of members for his spiritual kingdom, the Church, and of his elect for the kingdom of heaven,
                           is not unlike that of the father of a family, who hires workmen to labour in his vineyard. There are various opinions respecting
                           who are meant by <I>the first</I>, and by <I>the last,</I> in this parable. Many of the fathers suppose that the saints of
                           different states and degrees are here designed, whose reward will suffer no diminution from the circumstances of their having
                           come to the service of Christ at a late age of the world, according to Sts. Hilary, Gregory, and Theophylactus; or, at a late
                           age of life, according to Sts. Basil, Jerome, and Fulgentius. In the latter case, however, we must understand that their greater
                           fervour in co-operating with divine grace, in the latter part of their life, has supplied and compensated for the defect of
                           their preceding negligence; hence it may sometimes happen that the reward of such as enter late in life on the service of
                           God, will exceed that of the less fervent who have entered at an earlier period. But as Christ rather seems to speak here
                           of his <I>militant</I> than his <I>triumphant</I> Church, many commentators explain the parable of the Jews and Gentiles.
                           For the Jews, after bearing the yoke of the Mosaic law for so many ages, received nothing more than what was promised to the
                           observance of that law; whilst Christians receive a more plentiful reward for their more easy labour under the sweet yoke
                           of the gospel. In which sense Christ says to the Jews, Luke xiii. 29: Publicans and harlots shall go before you into the kingdom
                           of heaven. "And, strangers shall come from the east, and from the west, and the north, and the south, and shall sit down in
                           the kingdom of God. And behold they are last that shall be first, and they are first that shall be last." (Luke xiii. 30.)
                           --- Hence the Jews may be supposed to murmur, that they who are first in their vocation to be the people of God, and first
                           in the observance of his law, should not be preferred to others, who in these respects have been far posterior to them. (Tirinus)
                           --- By the vineyard, says St. Chrysostom, we here understand, the commandments of God. The time for labour is the present
                           life. In the first, third, sixth, ninth, and eleventh hours, i.e. in infancy, youth, manhood, declining years, and extreme
                           decrepitude of age, many individuals, yielding to the effective call of God, labour in the exact performance of the divine
                           commandments. (Hom. lxv.)</FONT></P><B>

                           the third hour.</I> As the Jews divided their nights into four watches, each watch comprehending three hours, so they divided
                           their days into four greater hours, from sunrise to sunset, and each of these great hours contained three lesser hours; so
                           that the whole day from sunrise to sunset, consisted of 12 hours, as also did the night. The first of the great hours, comprehending
                           the three first lesser hours, contained half of the space betwixt the rising of the sun and mid-day; and the end of this time
                           was called the <I>third hour.</I> The next great hour was from that time till mid-day, called the <I>sixth hour.</I> The following
                           great hour contained half of the time betwixt noon and the setting of the sun, the end of which was called the <I>ninth hour.</I>
                           The fourth great hour comprehended the last three lesser hours remaining till sunset, so that at the end of the <I>eleventh
                           hour,</I> mentioned here, ver. 6, began the last lesser hour of the twelve hours of the day; of which our Saviour said, (John
                           xi. 9,) <I>are there not twelve hours in the day?</I> --- As to the moral sense of the parable, by the <I>day</I> is commonly
                           expounded all the time from the <I>creation</I> to the end of the world, and so the third hour is reckoned from <I>Adam</I>
                           to <I>Noe;</I> the sixth from <I>Noe</I> to <I>Abraham;</I> the ninth from <I>Abraham</I> to <I>Moses;</I> and from the ninth
                           to the eleventh, was from <I>Moses</I> till <I>Christ's</I> coming; and the time from <I>Christ</I> to the <I>end of the world,</I>
                           is the 12th hour. Other interpreters, by <I>the day</I> understand <I>human life;</I> and by the different hours, <I>infancy,
                           youth, the age of manhood, old age,</I> and the last hour <I>man's decrepit age.</I> God is master and disposer of all, who
                           by his grace calls some sooner, some later. The <I>market-place,</I> in which men are so often found idle, as to the great
                           concern of their eternal salvation, is the <I>world.</I> The design of this parable was to shew that the Gentiles, though
                           called later than the Jews, should be made partakers of the promises made to the Jews; this is also the meaning of verse 16,
                           where it is said: <I>the last shall be first, and the first last.</I> (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           man hath hired us.</I> St. Chrysostom again puts us in mind, that in parables all the parts are not significant, but some
                           things are to be taken as mere ornaments of parabolical discourses, as here <I>murmurings,</I> which cannot be found in heaven:
                           nor can men pretend they <I>are not hired</I> into God's service; God hath given lights, called, hired, and promised heaven
                           to all. The rewards in heaven are also different. And they who are last called, if they labour with greater fervour, may deserve
                           a greater reward than others called before them. (Witham) --- The Greek text finishes with, <I>you shall receive what is reasonable.</I>
                           --- We must observe here, says St. Chrysostom on the words, <I>because no man hath hired us,</I> that this is the voice of
                           the labourers only, in excuse for their not having entered upon their work before this late hour; for the master of the vineyard
                           had shewn his willingness to hire them all, by going out early for that purpose. Though the fault was their own, he does not
                           upbraid them, but abstains from all harshness and severity, that he may the more easily engage them. (Hom. lxv.)</FONT></P><B>

                           when they received it.</I> By those who laboured all the day in the vineyard, we are to understand such as have spent their
                           whole lives in the service of God; but we are not thence to infer, that in the kingdom of heaven, where all receive their
                           just reward, there is envy, discontent, or any complaint. By these words, Christ wishes to convey to our minds an idea of
                           the immense honours that will be heaped upon all such as return with sincerity, though at the decline or even verge of life,
                           to the Almighty. So exceeding great will be their reward, that it would excite envy, were it possible, even in the elect.

                           will also give.</I> Some are called to the service of their God, and to a life of virtue, from their infancy, whilst others,
                           by a powerful call from above, are converted late in life, that the former may have no occasion to glory in themselves, or
                           to despise those who, even in the 11th hour, enter upon the path of rectitude; and that all might learn that there is time
                           sufficient, however short, left them to repair by their diligence and fervour their past losses. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxv.)
                           --- Jesus Christ does not count so much the number of years, as the fervour and diligence we employ in his service. Calvin
                           is rather unhappy in his choice of this parable to prove his favourite tenet, that salvation is not the reward of good works,
                           but of faith alone, or predestination, since Jesus Christ represents heaven as given wholly as a just reward of meritorious
                           labour in the vineyard, though some labour a shorter, and others a longer time, and God of his great goodness may give more
                           to some than to others, while to all He gives at least their due. And a truly humble Christian will be ever satisfied with
                           his lot, without envying that of others. (Haydock) --- <I>As star differeth from star in glory</I> in the firmament, (1 Corinthians
                           xv. 41,) so will there be different degrees of glory in heaven. (St. Augustine, de virgin. chap. xxvi.)</FONT></P><B>

                           Christians, and the conversion of strangers, who come and take their place, by a conversion both of faith and morals. On the
                           part of God all are called. (Matthew xi. 28.) <I>Come to me all,</I> &amp;c. In effect, many after their call, have attained
                           to faith and justification; but few in comparison are elected to eternal glory, because the far greater part do not obey the
                           call, but refuse to come, whilst many of those who come fall away again; and thus very few, in comparison with those that

                           we go,</I> &amp;c. Jesus here, for the third time, foretells his death; (the first time, Matthew xvi. 21; the second time,
                           Matthew xvii. 21.) Our salvation and happiness are owing to the death of Christ; neither is there any thing that more loudly
                           calls for our gratitude than his sufferings and death. Jesus takes the 12 apart, and reveals to them the mystery of his passion.
                           He had previously declared it in public, but in ambiguous terms, saying: <I>destroy this temple,</I> &amp;c. <I>A sign shall
                           not be given, but the sign of Jonas the prophet;</I> but here he manifestly expounds to his disciples the mystery: <I>behold
                           we go up to Jerusalem,</I> &amp;c. This discourse of our Saviour is remarkable for an energetic strength of expression. (St.
                           Chrysostom) --- Jesus had repeatedly spoken to his apostles of his passion; but as much of what he had said had escaped their
                           memory, now that he is upon the road to Jerusalem in company with his disciples, he brings it back to their recollection,
                           to fortify them against the scandal they might take at his ignominious death. (St. Jerome)</FONT></P><B>

                           joined his resurrection, that they might take notice, and not lose their faith. (Witham) --- Like the rest of the Jews, the
                           apostles were so fully prepossessed with the idea that the Messias would be immortal, that they could not understand what
                           Jesus Christ said to them. He, however, did reveal these things, that, on a future day, recollecting how their Lord and Master
                           had foreseen and foretold to them the most material circumstances relating to his passion and death, they might believe more
                           firmly in him, and be convinced that he suffered of his own free choice. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           reign in Jerusalem with great glory and power; and it was this made the mother of the sons of Zebedee petition that they might
                           take precedence, and be honoured by the other apostles. But Christ answers them that they knew not what they asked, for honours
                           were to be bestowed not on relationship, but on merit: in like manner, the dignities of the Church are not to be conferred
                           upon relatives, but upon the worthy. (Nicholas of Lyra.) --- On comparing the 27th chapter of St. Matthew with the 15th of
                           St. Mark, it will appear that she was the same as Salome. --- In St. Mark x. 35, we find that the sons themselves made this
                           petition: both the sons and their mother might make it; at least the sons may be said to have done what they got their mother
                           to desire for them; and therefore Christ directed his answer to them: <I>you know not what you ask.</I> You think, says St.
                           Chrysostom of temporal preferments, of honours, and crowns, when you should be preparing yourselves for conflicts and battles.
                           (Witham) --- Our Lord suffers these occasional weaknesses in his apostles, that he might, from his instructions and corrections,
                           render his doctrines more intelligible to them and to posterity. (St. Jerome)</FONT></P><B>

                           The Arians objected these words against Christ's divinity. St. Augustine answers that the words are true if taken of Christ,
                           as he was man. The easier answer is, that it was not <I>his</I> to give <I>to them,</I> while they were in those dispositions
                           of pride and ambition. So that the distinction made, is not betwixt the Father and his eternal Son, as if the Father could

                           is now wanting in the Greek manuscripts and must have been wanting in some of them in the fourth, or at least the fifth century,
                           since we find them not in St. Chrysostom. St. Augustine also in one place omits it, but sometimes lays great stress upon it;
                           Christ's meaning being no more, than that heaven was not his <I>to give them;</I> that is, <I>to the proud,</I> &amp;c. St.
                           Ambrose reads it; and what is still of greater weight, St. Jerome hath it in the text of the New Testament, which he corrected
                           from the best Greek manuscripts. (Witham) --- In your present state there is no exception of persons with God; for, whosoever
                           is worthy of heaven, shall receive it as the reward of his merits. Therefore Christ answers them, it is not mine to bestow
                           the kingdom of heaven upon you, because you are not yet deserving, on account of your pride in seeking to have yourselves
                           preferred before my other apostles. But be ye humble, and heaven is prepared for you, as well as for all others, who are properly
                           disposed. (Nicholas of Lyra.) --- Greatness in the next life will be proportioned to humility in this.</FONT></P><B>

                           --- Our Lord wishing to extinguish the indignation conceived against the two brothers, lays before them the difference of
                           secular and ecclesiastical princes, shewing that precedency in the Church is neither to be sought for by him who is not possessed
                           of it, nor too eagerly loved by him who has it; for secular princes are lords of their subjects, keeping them under subjection,
                           and govern them in every particular according to their will; but ecclesiastical princes are honoured with precedency, that
                           they may be servants of their inferiors, administer to them whatever they have received from Christ, neglect their own convenience
                           for the good of their neighbour, and be willing even to die for the spiritual good of their subjects. It is neither just nor
                           reasonable, therefore, to desire precedency in the Church, without these qualifications. No prudent man is willing to subject
                           himself to such servitude and danger, as to take upon himself the obligation of having to give an account of the wickedness
                           and perversity of others, unless fearless of the divine judgments, he abuse his ecclesiastical superiority. (St. Chrysostom)</FONT></P><B>

                           in common with the brute creation; it serves only to distinguish material objects. The light which Christ communicates to
                           the soul, enables us to know God and his sacred truths, as revealed to his holy Catholic Church; it elevates us above all
                           inferior creatures, it dissipates the spiritual darkness caused by sin and our unruly passions, and conducts us to the true
                           light of eternal glory. Oh what unspeakable joy must then fill and overwhelm the elect, when in the light of God they see
