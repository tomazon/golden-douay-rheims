                           The Jews observe, that if the father of the deceased were still alive, he would take the inheritance. (Selden, Success. xii.
                           and xiii.) But if his wife were inclined to marry again, she might insist on his next relation taking her, before she could
                           be required to give up his goods, Deuteronomy xxv. 5. Hence the Gemarra of Babylon says, "If we are the daughters of Salphaad,
                           let them give us his estate; but if we are not his daughters, let them make the brother of Salphaad marry our mother."</FONT></P><B>

                           (Grotius, Jur. ii. 7.) The relations by the mother's side, could claim no part. The husband was heir to all his wife's goods,
                           except her dowry, which went to her children. People born of a slave, or of a harlot or strange woman, were not lawful heirs.

                           Deuteronomy xxxiv. 1, 6. (Haydock) --- Moses, hoping that his sentence of exclusion from the promised land might be only a
                           threat, had earnestly besought God to let him enter. But being forbidden to speak of the matter any more, he understood that
                           it was as irrevocable as an <I>oath,</I> Deuteronomy iii. 26., and iv. 21. He turned, therefore, his whole solicitude to obtain
                           of God some one, who might enjoy the honour and happiness of conducting the people, and putting them in possession of God's
                           promises. He regards not flesh and blood on this occasion, (Philo, de caritate.; Salien,) but sets a noble pattern for all
                           ecclesiastical superiors to imitate. (Du Hamel)</FONT></P><B>

                           Christ makes use of the same comparison, John x. 1. Kings are often styled shepherds in Homer. Moses begs that his successor
                           may be enabled to conduct the multitude in both peace and war. --- <I>To go in and out,</I> means to govern, (3 Kings iii.
                           7,) and includes all the occurrences of life, Acts i. 21., and Psalm cxx. 8. (Calmet) --- Thus, temporal princes are the shepherds
                           of the people. But they are not, on that account, supreme in spiritual causes. For here Josue only receives part of the glory
                           of Moses, while Eleazar is appointed to consult the Lord for him, and to direct him in all matters of importance, ver. 20,

                           (Deuteronomy xxxiv. 9,) of which he received a fresh increase, by the imposition of the hands of Moses. By the like ceremony
                           people are confirmed, and ministers of religion are still ordained, Acts vi. 6., and 1 Timothy iv. 14. (Calmet) --- God endues
                           Josue with all the necessary qualifications for his high office. He makes choice of him, and not of any of the relations of
                           Moses, that the people might not be offended at the supreme power being in a manner engrossed by one family; and he appoints
                           one 93 year old, that the success of war might not be attributed to Josue, though he had been long at the head of the armies,
                           and a man of the greatest authority, even the vice-gerent of Moses. He declares his election before all the multitude, with
                           the high priest at their head, that there might be no dispute about the matter; and, on this account, he requires various
                           external ceremonies to be observed. (Salien)</FONT></P><B>

                           we find few wars undertaken, without consulting God: (Calmet) and the Rabbins assert, that the kings could not declare any
                           war of their own accord, without the consent of the high priest and Sanhedrim. (Selden, Syned. iii. 12.) Saul lost his crown
