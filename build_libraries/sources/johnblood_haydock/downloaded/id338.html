                           <p><strong><font size="3">Notes &amp; Commentary:</font></strong></p>
                           <p><font size="3"><strong>Ver. 1.</strong> <i>Speech.</i> Probably Hebrew; in which language we have the most ancient book
                           in the world, the work of Moses. This language has been preserved ever since, though with some alterations. Most of the oriental
                           languages are but like dialects from it, as French, Italian, &amp;c. are from Latin. The arguments which are brought to prove
                           that other languages are more ancient, because the names of men, &amp;c. have a proper significance in them as well as in
                           Hebrew, do not invalidate the right of the latter. The most respectable authors have, therefore, always declared for it. (Haydock)</font></p>
                           <p><font size="3"><strong>Ver. 2.</strong> <i>The East:</i> Armenia, which lies to the eastward of Babylonia, whither they
                           directed their course in quest of provisions for themselves and cattle, being now grown pretty numerous. (Menochius)</font></p>
                           <p><font size="3"><strong>Ver. 3.</strong> <i>Each one:</i> not that every individual joined in this undertaking, considered,
                           at least, as a rash and presumptuous attempt to save themselves from a second deluge. Some might innocently give in to it,
                           meaning only to leave a monument to their common origin and friendship, before they separated into distant countries. <i>Slime:</i>
                           literally bitumen. (Haydock) --- The Hebrew, <i>chomer,</i> means also slime, or mortar. Stone is very scarce in that country,
                           but the earth is fat, and very proper to make brick; it also abounds in naphtha, bitumen, &amp;c.: hence the ancients notice
                           the brick walls of Babylon. (Calmet)</font></p>
                           <p><font size="3"><strong>Ver. 4.</strong> <i>Famous before;</i> Hebrew <i>lest,</i> &amp;c.; as if they intended to prevent
                           that event. (Haydock) --- Their motive appears to have been pride, which raised the indignation of God. Nemrod, the chief
                           instigator, might have designed the tower for a retreat, whence he might sally out and maintain his tyranny. (Menochius)</font></p>
                           <p><font size="3"><strong>Ver. 6.</strong> <i>In deed.</i> This seems to be spoken ironically; though the effects of weak
                           mortals, <i>the sons of Adam,</i> when pursued with vigour and unanimity, will produce great effects. These builders had conceived
                           an idea of raising the tower as high as possible, hyperbolically, to touch heaven. (Haydock)</font></p>
                           <p><font size="3"><strong>Ver. 7.</strong> <i>Come ye,</i> &amp;c. As men seemed bent on taking heaven by storm, like the
                           ancient giants, God turns their expressions, as it were, against themselves, and shews them an example of humility, <i>let
                           us go down.</i> He acts the part of a judge, and therefore will examine all with the utmost diligence, as he denotes by these
                           expressions; being really incapable of moving from place to place, on account of his immensity. (Haydock) --- He seems nearer
                           to men, by the effects or punishments which he inflicted. The address which he here makes is directed, not to the angels,
                           but to the other co-equal powers of the Blessed Trinity. (Menochius)</font></p>
                           <p><font size="3"><strong>Ver. 9.</strong> <i>Babel,</i> that is, <i>confusion.</i> This is one of the greatest miracles recorded
                           in the Old Testament; men forgot, in a moment, the language which they had hitherto spoken, and found themselves enabled to
                           speak another, known only to a few of the same family (Calmet); for we must not suppose, that there were as many new languages
                           as there were men at Babel. (Menochius) --- The precise number of languages which were then heard, cannot be determined. The
                           learned commonly acknowledge the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Teutonic, Sclavonian, Tartarian, and Chinese languages, to be original.
                           The rest are only dialects from these. English is chiefly taken from the Teutonic, (Calmet) with many words borrowed from
                           the Greek and other languages. (Haydock)</font></p>
                           <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif"><font size="3"><strong>Ver. 12.</strong> <i>Sale,</i> or Cainan. See Chap. x.
                           24; Chronicles[1 Chronicles?] i. 18, in the Septuagint.&nbsp; The variation in the years of the Patriarchs, between this ancient
                           version and the Hebrew, is here again very considerable, and perhaps unaccountable. (Haydock)</font></font></p>
                           <p><font size="3"><strong>Ver. 20.</strong> <i>Sarug:</i> in whose days St. Epiphanius places the origin of idolatry; but
                           Eusebius (Præp. i. v. &amp; 9.) thinks it began in Egypt, among the posterity of Cham. (Calmet)</font></p>
                           <p><font size="3"><strong>Ver. 27.</strong> <i>Abram,</i> the youngest of the three, being born only in the 130th year of
                           Thare, ver. 32, and chap. xii. 4. He is placed first, on account of his superior dignity in the church of God, in like manner
                           as Sem, Moses, &amp;c. In his youth, he is supposed to have followed the idolatrous worship of his fathers. (St. Augustine,
                           City of God x. chap. ult.[last chap.]; Genebrard, A.M. 1949[the year of the world 1949].) (Calmet) --- But being soon enlightened
                           by God, he becomes a glorious witness of the truth, and, according to many, is preserved miraculously, when thrown into the
                           fire <i>by the Chaldees,</i> ver. 31. (Haydock)</font></p>
                           <p><font size="3"><strong>Ver. 29.</strong> <i>Jescha,</i> whom many confound with Sarai, as if both Nacher and Abram had
                           married the daughters of their brother Aran. But why then does Moses mention Sarai before, and then call her Jescha in the
                           same verse? It seems as if he intended to designate two different women. (Haydock) --- In effect, Abram himself says, Sarai
                           was truly his <i>sister, born of the same father,</i> chap. xii. 13. See chap. xx. 12, where we shall give the reasons that
                           seem to prove that she was the daughter of Thare, and not Aran. (Calmet) --- Jescha does not accompany her grandfather, preferring,
                           perhaps, to stay with Nachor, or to marry in her own country; if she were not already dead when Thare departed from <i>Ur,</i>
                           a city <i>of the Chaldees.</i> (Haydock) --- This city is probably Ura, in Mesopotamia, not far from Nisibis, which the Scripture
                           often mentions as a part of Chaldea. (Acts vii. 2, &amp;c.) (Calmet) --- It is not, however, certain that the rest of Thare's
                           family remained behind; if they did, they removed soon after into the country about Haran, or Charræ, on the Chaboras. (Chap.
                           xxix. 4; Josephus, Antiquities 1. 6.) (Haydock)</font></p></font>
