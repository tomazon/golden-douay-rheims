                           of the house of Israel, and the man who sent him away to us unto <i>certain</i> death. And they called Achior from the house
                           of Ozias. But as soon as he came, and saw the head of Holofernes in the hand of one of the assembly of the people, he fell,"
                           &amp;c., as [in] chap. xiii. 29, 30. "Blessed art thou in every tent of Juda, and in every nation. All who shall hear thy
                           name shall be amazed. But now tell me what thou hast done during these days. And Judith, in the midst of the people, informed
                           him of all that she had performed, since the day of her departure till the time when she was speaking. She had no sooner ended
                           her speech, than all the people set up a loud shout of joy in their city. Then," &amp;c. --- <i>Leaving.</i> Greek, "He believed
                           in God greatly," or with the utmost sincerity. (Haydock) --- Hitherto Achior had only considered the Deity as the peculiar
                           God of Israel, (Calmet) or as <i>the common gods</i> "revered by all nations;" (Virgil xii.; Servius) but not as the only
                           supreme Being. He now becomes a proselyte, not merely, like Naaman, to adore one God; but also to observe all the rites of
                           the Jewish religion. The latter was a matter of choice, chap. vi. 18. It is not still clear that he could enjoy the privileges
                           of the nation as a magistrate, or even marry, (Calmet) which shews his greater fervour. (Grotius) --- It is certain that no
                           nation could be forbidden to worship God, Deuteronomy xxiii. 3. St. Thomas Aquinas (1. 2. q. 105. a. 3.) believes that a dispensation
                           was granted to Achior, (Calmet) so that he might be treated like an Israelite in all respects. (Serarius q. 1.) (Menochius)

                                    upon the walls, and every man took his arms, and they sent out with a great noise and shouting.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And the watchmen, seeing this, ran to the tent of Holofernes.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And they that were in the tent, came and made a noise before the door

                                    but by their noise.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 For no man durst knock, or open and go into the chamber of the general

                                    came near to the curtain, and lifting it up, and seeing the body of Holofernes, lying upon the ground, without the head, weltering
                                    in his blood, he cried out with a loud voice, with weeping, and rent his garments.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And he went into the tent of Judith, and not finding her, he ran out
