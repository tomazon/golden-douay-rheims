                           it mean to be guilty of an untruth," &amp;c., says Josephus; "yet his disposition was not altered. He resolved, therefore,
                           to take away his life, and wished Jonathan and his most trusty servants to put his designs in execution." He then mentions
                           the friendship of these two. But he takes no notice of the proffered marriage of Merob, and he seems not to have known that
                           she was ever promised. See ver. 17., and 19., and chap. xvii. 12. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Of the subsequent verses, the Roman Septuagint has only the following words. "And all Israel lived him; (<B>29</B>) and Saul
                           still continued to be in awe of him." The Alexandrian manuscript agrees with the Hebrew, only, instead of <I>Michol,</I> &amp;c.,
                           it reads, "all Israel." If the contested passages were omitted, the history would be less perplexed. But we must wait for
                           the decision of the Church in matters of this nature, and never decide to peremptorily. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>
