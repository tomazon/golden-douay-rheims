                           his name. (Witham) --- This is the daily sacrifice of Christians, foretold plainly by Malachias, chap. i. 10. 11. This is
                           also clearly mentioned in St. Justin Martyr, Dial. cum Tryphone.; Tertullian, co. M.[contra Marcion?] lib. iii. chap. 21.;

                           The apostate Courayer, who pretending to remain a Catholic, ended by becoming a Socinian or Unitarian, taught that persons
                           were at liberty to deny the real presence, and admit with Catholics a <I>commemorative</I> or representative <SPAN lang=EN>sacrifice,
                           which applies to us the merits of Christ's death. But this system was condemned by the Gallican church, as contrary to the
                           doctrine of the Council of Trent, which has defined the mass to be not merely a <I>commemorative</I> and <I>representive</I>
                           sacrifice</SPAN>, but a true and real offering of a victim, really present, and actually offered to God by the priest. "By
                           his <I>last sentiments,</I> (published by Dr. Bell) it appears, says the New Gen. Biogr. Dict. edited by Chalmers, an. 1814[A.D.
                           1814], vol. lxxx. art. <I>Courayer,</I> that although he professed to die a member of the Roman Catholic Church, he could
                           not well be accounted a member of that, or of any other established Church. In rejecting the doctrine of the Trinity, he became
                           nearly, if not quite, a Socinian, or modern Unitarian; he denied also the inspiration of the holy Scriptures, as to matters
                           of fact; and as to baptism, seems to wish to confine it to adults. In 1811 a more full exposure of his sentiments was published
                           by Dr. Bell, in a posthumous work of Courayer, <I>on the Divinity of Jesus Christ,</I> 8vo. a publication we have little hesitation
                           in saying ought never to have appeared. It could not be wanting to illustrate the wavering, unsettled character of the author.
                           The creed of innovators is never fixed; and when once they cast off the authority of the Church, they are carried about, like
                           children, with every wind of doctrine."</FONT></P>

                           even towards sinners, that he made them a solemn promise, clearly expressed in the prophet Jeremias, (Chap. xxxi. 31. &amp;c.)

                           a father: and so great is the efficacy of this divine teacher, that by means of a short and easy catechism, children are now
                           taught to know God more perfectly than the first sages of antiquity by their abstruse and erudite disquisitions. We moreover
                           observe under the new law the grace and spirit of love, engrafted in the hearts of the faithful by the Holy Ghost working
                           in the sacraments and sacrifice of the new law to that effect....This covenant was made at the last supper, and ratified the
                           next day by the death of the Testator on the cross, when he exclaimed, "consummatum est," all is consummated. [John xix. 30.]</FONT></P><B>

                           nations, the faithful in the new law should have a greater knowledge of God, of the true manner of worshipping him, and of
                           heavenly things, and also greater and more abundant graces than they had before Christ's coming. They shall also serve God
                           with greater fidelity, by considering his mercy in sending them a Redeemer to free them from the slavery of sin and damnation,
                           of which they stood guilty. (Witham)</FONT></FONT></P><B>
