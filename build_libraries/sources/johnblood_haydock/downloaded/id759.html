                           <i>David.</i> Some of the Greek copies add, "psalm," and "unto the end." It was composed during the persecutions of Saul,
                           &amp;c., and is applied by the Fathers to Jesus Christ, who quotes ver. 19, (John xv. 25.; Calmet) and it seems to be in the
                           same state with several others, which speak of his sufferings. (Berthier) --- The expressions are very animated, and though
                           vengeance was not so strictly forbidden under the old law, (Matthew v. 44.) yet we may explain them as predictions. (Theodoret)
                           --- David always evinces the greatest moderation, (Psalm vii. 5.) and treated even Saul with the utmost respect. What he says,
                           therefore, was dictated by a sincere desire of their conversion, and that they might prevent eternal torments; as well as
                           to set the conduct of God in a proper light, and to encourage the virtuous. (Asterius) (Calmet) --- His name implies one "beloved,"
                           &amp;c., inasmuch as he is a figure of Christ, the conqueror of death and hell. (St. Augustine) (Worthington) --- <i>Judge.</i>
                           Hebrew, "plead." I do not wish them to be condemned unheard. (Calmet) --- A vindictive person does not thus commit his cause
                           to God. Jesus Christ was all mildness. But in the spiritual warfare, we may well address these words to God, (Berthier) who
                           is often represented as a mighty warrior, Exodus xv. 3. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           12.) --- But the Church admits the power of the wicked spirits only against those who take part with them, or "as far as God
                           allows them" (St. Jerome) to tempt. The devil is like a dog chained down, which can bite none but those who come within its
                           reach. (St. Augustine) --- Both good and bad angels are ministers of God's justice. (Haydock)</font></p><b>
