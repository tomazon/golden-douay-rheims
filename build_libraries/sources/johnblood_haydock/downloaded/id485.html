                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 If you would wait till they were grown up, and come to man's estate,

                                    and the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And Noemi said to her: Behold thy kinswoman is returned to her people,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 She answered: Be not against me, to desire that I should leave thee
                                    and depart: for whithersoever thou shalt go, I will go: and where thou shalt dwell, I also will dwell. Thy people <i>shall

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Then Noemi seeing that Ruth was steadfastly determined to go with

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 So they went together, and came to Bethlehem. And when they were come
                                    into the city, the report was quickly spread among all: and the women said: This is that Noemi.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 But she said to them: Call me not Noemi (that is, beautiful), but

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 I went out full, and the Lord hath brought me back empty. Why then

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 So Noemi came with Ruth, the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, from
