                           obtained of Agrippa leave to wear the linen tunic, which was deemed a great innovation, seldom left unpunished. (Josephus,

                           The whole person was thus sensibly consecrated to God's service. (Haydock) --- The pagan high priest, among the Romans, was
                           adorned in silk and ribbands, with a crown of gold. Being conducted under ground, the blood of an ox, which had been sacrificed,
                           came upon his head, ears, and other parts of his body, through little holes, made in a board; and thus besmeared, he was recognized
                           by the people. (Prudent. hym. S. Romani, Saumaise. &amp;c.)</FONT></P><B>

                           It is a maxim among the Rabbins, that a priest without his vestments, is not considered as such; and he is put to death, if
                           he should dare to approach the altar in that condition. When the priests lay aside their sacred robes, they are looked upon
                           as laymen. (Calmet) --- The high priest was consecrated by the unction on the head; (ver. 12,) those of an inferior condition,
                           were sprinkled with ointment mixed with blood, &amp;c. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           During this time, some say they were allowed to go our for a short time, to satisfy the calls of nature; while others say
                           they were to continue always in the tabernacle, or in the court. Afterwards the priests on duty continued all the time in
                           the temple, adorned with their sacred robes. The high priest could not wear his on other occasions, except some very urgent
                           affair required it, as was the case when Jaddus went to meet Alexander. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           They might be permitted to take a little sleep during part of this week. (Tirinus) --- <I>In:</I> Hebrew, "at the door of

                           Moses officiated as the consecrating priest. One of the most venerable of the order, consecrated the successors of Aaron.
                           Some assert, that they only invested him with the pontifical robes. (Numbers xx. 25.; 1 Machabees x. 21.) (Calmet) --- The
                           power of Moses was extraordinary; that of Aaron was ordinary, designed to continue in after ages. (St. Augustine, q. 23.)
                           None must presume to take this office of priest, but such as are called by God, Hebrews v. Those of the old law, were initiated
                           by sacred rites or sacraments, which signified the grace of God, requisite to perform their duties well. They were chosen
                           from among men, to be more holy; of which their washing was a sign, as their splendid robes were to remind them of their sublime
                           dignity and authority over the people. The high priest had seven special ornaments: 1. white linen, to denote purity; 2. a
                           curious girdle, intimating that he must use discretion in all things; 3. the long tunic of various colours, with bells, &amp;c.,
                           signifying heavenly conversation upon earth, union and harmony in faith and morals; 4. an ephod, with two precious stones
                           on the shoulders, teaching him to support the failings of the multitude; 5. the rational, with its ornaments, shew that the
                           pontiff should be solicitous to teach sound and profitable doctrine; 6. the mitre indicates, that all his actions should be
                           referred to God above; and lastly, the plate of gold denotes that he should have God always in view, and never forget that
                           consummate holiness which He requireth. See St. Jerome, ep. ad Fabiol. --- The three ornaments of the priests, put them in
                           mind of purity, discretion, and a right intention, to be observed in all their conduct. On this occasion, a change was introduced
                           in the priesthood, as the law was new; the first-born being obliged to give place to Aaron's family. Thus, when these were
                           deprived of the exclusive privilege, and people from any family were chosen by Christ, the law of Moses ceased to exist, Hebrews
                           vii. The ordination of the former was a figure of that sacrament, by which Christian priests still receive grace and power.
