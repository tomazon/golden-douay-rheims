                           no doubt but the true number was seventy-two. For seventy-two may be called seventy; but had they been only seventy, they
                           could never have been called seventy-two. This was also the exact number of the judges chosen to assist Moses; (Exodus xxiv.
                           1.) though called seventy, (Numbers xi. 16.) as it is evident, because there were six chosen out of every one of the twelve
                           tribes. In like manner the exact number of the interpreters called the Septuagint must have been seventy-two; and also the
                           just number of the Sanhedrim. --- <I>Two and two,</I> that one might be a help and comfort to the other; as also a witness

                           formerly chose twelve elders as princes and fathers of the twelve tribes of Israel, and afterwards gave to each of these elders
                           six others, to assist them in the arduous work of governing the people, so our divine Saviour chose twelve apostles to govern
                           his Church. He likewise afterwards gave six disciples to each apostle, which makes 72, to serve as priests, and assist in
                           governing the Church. (Tirinus) --- <I>Salute no man,</I> i.e. go forwards promptly, and do not stay to amuse yourselves with
                           vain compliments and useless civilities towards those whom you meet. This was a proverb. Eliseus said the same to Giezi, when
                           he sent him to restore life to the child of the widow of Sunamis. If any man meet you, salute him not; think of nothing but

                           saw Satan as lightning,</I> &amp;c. Many expound it in this manner: I, who am from eternity, saw Satan with all the rebellious
                           angels, as glorious as they were, fall from heaven; fear then, and tremble, though you have received such favours from God.
                           Others take it in this sense, that Christ, by his incarnation, hath seen the power of the devils lessened and confounded,
                           according to what he also said, (John xii. 31.) <I>Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</I> (Witham) --- What connexion
                           have these words with what goes before? Some understand them thus: the reign of the devil is near at an end; this prince of
                           darkness is going to be overturned; he will fall from the air, where he reigns, with the same precipitation as lightning,
                           which cuts the clouds and presently disappears. It is almost the same thing he says in other places. "The prince of this world
                           is already judged; behold now is the judgment of this world; behold now the prince of this world shall be cast forth! When
                           I sent you to preach the gospel to the poor, I saw Satan fall; I saw his empire overturned. The last effort which this empire
                           of darkness shall make is the death of our Saviour, as he himself says: This is your hour, and the power of darkness. Since
                           his resurrection he has bound the dragon in the abyss for a thousand years; he has shut up the entrance, and sealed it with
                           his seal." (Apocalypse xii. 9. and xx. 2.) Others think that Jesus speaks here of the fall of Lucifer, at the beginning of
                           the creation. Wishing to give his disciples a lesson in humility, on account of the vain complacency which he saw they took
                           in the miracles they wrought, he says to them: Beware of pride, that precipitated the first angel from heaven: I have seen
                           him in the glory with which he was surrounded, and I have seen him hurried into the abyss. Fear, lest the same should happen
                           to you. The former explanation appears to us more simple and literal. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           of some animals, proceed from the malice of the devil. These are the arms and the instruments he makes use of to kill us,
                           being the prince of death and a murderer from the beginning, as the Scripture styles him. The Jews attributed sickness, poisons,

                           assist him. But according to the opinion of most fathers, the intent of this parable is the shew, that every person who has
