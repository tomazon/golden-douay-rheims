                           <i>Sworn,</i> (juraverunt.) The mention of <i>Maspha,</i> seems to determine that this oath was taken before the battle; though
                           it would otherwise appear, that the Israelites engaged themselves to extirpate the tribe in the heat of their fury, and after
                           they destroyed the women of Benjamin. If they could lawfully slay their brethren indiscriminately, as connected in the same
                           wicked cause, (Haydock) they might surely refuse their daughters to any of those (Menochius) who might chance to make their
                           escape. (Haydock) --- But they ought first to have consulted the Lord, as this was a matter of as great consequence as to
                           know who was first to go to battle. They seem to have discovered the rashness of their proceedings, and to have repented when
                           it was too late; and they ridiculously attempt to elude the obligation of the oath, which lay heavy on their consciences.
                           (Salien) --- They think it sufficient to adhere to the letter, while they neglect the spirit of their oath. (Haydock) ---
                           The ancients had a scrupulous regard for oaths, and did not allow themselves the liberty of interpreting them away, Genesis
                           xxiv. 5., Josue ix. 15., and 1 Kings xiv. 24. (Calmet) --- But here the Israelites wish to keep and to evade the oath at the
                           same time. (Haydock) --- Serarius, &amp;c., declare that their oath was lawful, as they did not consider the inconveniences
                           which would attend its execution. As soon as they perceived them, the obligation ceased; though, if their erroneous conscience
                           dictated the contrary to them, they were obliged to follow it, (Tirinus) if they could not receive a more certain information.
                           (Haydock) --- Tostat and others maintain that the oath was null, as being illegal, and consequently of no force. Grotius (Jur.
                           ii. 2, 21,) lays it down as the right of nature, for people to marry with their neighbours, (Calmet) though any individual
                           may refuse such connexions; (Haydock) and St. Augustine (de C.[City of God?] ii. 17.) allows, that the Romans had "a right,
                           perhaps, to seize the Sabine women, in a war declared on account of the unjust refusal." We can excuse the Benjamites for
                           taking the women of Silo, by force, on no other plea, (Calmet) unless the consent of the parents and of the virgins intervened.
                           (Haydock) (Ver. 22.) --- If, therefore, the Israelites could not lawfully deny their daughters in marriage to the Benjamites,
                           their oath was unjust, and nowise obligatory. (Calmet) --- They had not right to punish the innocent with the guilty, as they
                           had received no order from God; (Salien) and therefore they ought not to have slain the unoffending females of Benjamin, or
                           of Jabes, ver. 11. It is not necessary for us to defend the rash oaths or conduct of the Israelites in exterminating their
                           fellow creatures, who were innocent; nor in the rape, &amp;c.</font></p><b>

                           remaining Benjamites from having any posterity, unless they married with strangers, which the law forbade, (Calmet) though
                           it would hardly bind in cases of such necessity. (Haydock) --- Hence the sons of Noemi are excused from entering into such
                           marriages, Ruth i. 4. (Tirinus) --- Hebrew and Septuagint do not mention, <i>so great an evil,</i> but only <i>this.</i> The
                           context however shews, that the people considered the extermination of a whole tribe, as a dreadful misfortune; and, as it
                           was going to take place in consequence of their oath, unless some expedient could be discovered to prevent it, without the
                           guilt of perjury, they were moved with repentance, and endeavoured to appease God's wrath by a multiplicity of victims. How
                           much better would it have been not to have made a vow, than after making it, to strive to render it ineffectual! (Ecclesiastes
                           v. 3, 4.) It does not appear that God gave them any answer in all this affair; and the concluding verse seems to indicate,
                           that their conduct was displeasing to him. Perhaps he punished this, as well as the other faults of his people, by delivering
                           them over to Chusan for eight years, as Salien and Usher place the first year of servitude immediately after the close of
                           this unfortunate war, which would enable the Chanaanites to gain fresh strength, and to rejoice at the civil broils of Israel,

                           out of the court, by God's dispensation, as they were defiled with blood; (Numbers xxxi. 24.; Calmet) though this is not certain,
                           as four months elapsed between the battle and the reconciliation of the remaining Israelites with their brethren: (chap. xx.
                           47.) so that during that interval, they might have committed the massacres in the different cities, and still have had time
                           to be purified seven days, as the law required, before they could be allowed to enter the <i>camp</i> or the tabernacle. (Haydock)
                           --- Some think that <i>one</i> altar was prescribed only during the sojournment in the desert. See Serarius. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           that they were legally summoned, nor had the majority of the people a right to execute such summary justice upon a few, who

                           of Silo, in memory of the ark being transported thither. Vatable thinks that the description here given, regards the place
                           where the dance was to be, as all must have known the situation of the city. Silo rather lies to the west than to the east,
                           (Calmet) if we draw a line from Bethel to Sichem, but the road might be circuitous. (Haydock) --- St. Jerome places Silo ten
                           miles west of Sichem. --- <i>Lebona</i> may be Chan Lebna, four miles to the south of it. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>To dance;</i> not in a lascivious manner, as a certain heretical interpreter would have it, but out of a religious motive.
                           (Menochius) --- Such dances were formerly very common among all nations. The Therapeuts, who are supposed to have been the
                           first Jewish converts to the Christian faith, in Egypt, and were remarkable for their modesty and serious deportment, danced
                           nevertheless in their religious assemblies, first in two separate bands, and afterwards men and women together. (Philo, contemplat.)
                           The women still dance round the tombs of their relatives, in Palestine, with solemn lamentations. (Roger, and Le Brun's Voyages)
                           --- <i>Come.</i> Josephus insinuates, that the women were to be seized as they came from different parts to the solemnity.
                           But it hence appears that they were coming out of the city; (Calmet) though it is very probable that the virgins did not all
                           belong to it, but came from all Israel: for why should the people of Silo be forced to supply wives for these surviving Benjamites,
                           against whose character they might reasonably entertain such strong objections? But, if all the assembly agreed that the Benjamites
                           should select from among their daughters whomsoever they could lay their hands on, they could not complain that they were
                           treated with peculiar severity. (Haydock) --- But did not the Israelites offend by giving this counsel, so contrary to the
                           import of their vow? And were not the Benjamites equally guilty in following such advice? It is answered that, in odious matters
                           words must be taken in all their rigour, and the person who vows not to <i>give,</i> does not engage himself to reclaim if
                           the thing be <i>taken.</i> Those who gave the advice are not perhaps deserving of excuse, on account of the artifice which
                           they employ to get rid of their oath; but the rest, who were not apprised of it till after the execution, were surely without
                           blame; and the Benjamites, who followed the counsel of respectable men, in such circumstances, cannot be considered as guilty
                           of a rape, &amp;c. (Grotius, Jur. ii. 13.; Cornelius a Lapide) (Calmet) --- St. Ambrose (ep. 6,) seems to be of this opinion.
                           Tostat and others cannot, however, approve of these arguments. "As they erroneously supposed that they were bound by their
                           oath, they <i>prudently</i> turned aside to advise the rape." (Tirinus) --- So Liranus, &amp;c. --- But this was only a human
                           prudence. (Haydock) --- The ancients gave counsel to the Benjamites, to ask the people of Silo to give them their daughters
                           in marriage, knowing they would not grant the request, that they might afterwards have recourse to the expedient of taking
                           them by force. "No doubt they were not without blame. For as they believed that their oath was binding, they ought neither
                           to have done nor to have advised any thing, by which it might be violated." (Salien, in the year of the world 2622.) --- The
                           rape at Silo preceded that of the Sabines, at Rome, about 700 years, and both probably happened in September. (Tirinus)</font></p><b>
