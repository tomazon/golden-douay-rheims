                           Zin, or Tsin, nearer to Judea than the desert, where the Hebrews encamped before, Exodus xvi. 1. (Haydock) --- Moses informs
                           us of very little from the time when the people murmured at Cades-barne, in the second year, till the beginning of the 40th
                           year of their sojournment. --- <I>In Cades.</I> The Rabbins assert, they remained there the first time twenty-nine years,
                           (chap. xiv. 45,) and the second, ten. (Genebrard, in the year of the world 2670.) But we do not believe they continued there
                           above a year the first time. --- <I>Mary.</I> St. Gregory of Nyssa, and St. Ambrose, suppose she was always a virgin, in which
                           respect she was a figure of our blessed Lady, as well as in her name. She was probably 130 years old, as she was very discreet
                           at the time of the birth of Moses, and employed by Providence in preserving his life, as the blessed Virgin screened our Saviour
                           from the fury of Herod. She had the superintendence over the Hebrew women; (Exodus xv. 20.; Theodoret, in Mic. vi. 4) and
                           hence many apply to her and her brothers those words of Zacharias, (xi. 8,) <I>I cut off three shepherds in one month.</I>
                           Mary died without being permitted to enter the promised land, on account of her murmuring, chap. xii. Thus the synagogue,
                           though proud of her prerogatives, cannot enter the land of rest. (Calmet) --- <I>There.</I> Some place this Cades not far
                           from the Red Sea, (ver. 20,) south of Idumea, while the other was to the north, and nearer Chanaan, being generally called
                           Cades-barne. (Bonfrere and Cornelius a Lapide) (Chap. xx. 16.) --- In this place Mary died, four months before Aaron. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           Your frequent murmurs will stop the course of God's bounty. If God had not condemned the conduct of his ministers on this
                           occasion, we could hardly find any reason to blame them. But the Fathers observe, that they betrayed a want of resolution,
                           and intended to throw the blame upon the incredulity of the people, in case they failed of success. <I>Because they exasperated

                           were not commanded to strike the rock at all; and when the water did not come at first, they struck again, (Calmet) being
                           afraid lest they should now be taken for impostors. (Haydock) --- They speak as if the work was their own. --- <I>Can we,</I>
                           &amp;c. They exasperate the people, instead of promoting their conversion. In a word, they did not glorify God, (Calmet) by
                           representing him as the sovereign holiness and mercy; and the God of unbounded power. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           the people who dwelt near Mount Hor. Those of Seir, lying more to the west, (Du Hamel) granted them leave to pass, and to
                           buy food, Deuteronomy ii. 28, 29. Grotius maintains, that the Hebrews might justly have forced a passage upon this refusal;
                           as St. Augustine (q. 44,) says, that they might lawfully have waged war upon the Amorrhites, on the like occasion; and the
                           holy wars have been defended on the same plea, because the Saracens would not suffer the Christians to go in pilgrimage to
                           the holy land. See Mare, lib. i. 1. But Selden (Mare, claus. 20,) asserts, that princes have a right to hinder others from
                           passing through their territories; and St. Augustine only excepts one case, when they are sure the strangers can or will do
                           no harm. But how can they obtain this assurance? Calmet answers, the long continuance of the Hebrews near the confines of
                           Seir, without offering any molestation, and their being conducted by so holy a general, might give the people of Hor sufficient
                           security. But at any rate the Israelites could not wage war upon them for refusing a passage, since they were expressly forbidden
                           by God: <I>Stir not against them,</I> (Deuteronomy ii. 5,) the people of <I>Seir,</I> nor against any of the Idumeans, <I>the
                           children of Esau,</I> who had taken possession of the country of the Horrhites, Genesis xiv. 6. The Hebrews seem to have been
                           convinced of this, otherwise they would not have feared their multitudes, nor taken such a circuitous road. The angel in the
                           cloud directed them to proceed, without molesting their territory. They went, therefore, towards the south, round the land
                           of the Idumeans, who dwelt near the Dead Sea. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           high priest. He was dispensed with on this occasion to attend his dying father. The spirit of God gives great encomiums to
                           Aaron, Malachias ii. 4-7., and Ecclesiasticus xlv. 7, 27. He, at the same time, prefigured Christ, the gospel, and the old
                           law. He spoke plainly, and was allowed to enter the holy of holies; while Moses was excluded, spoke with difficulty, and had
                           a veil on his face. See St. Jerome, ep. ad Fab. man. 33. But on the other hand, he represented the law with all its defects.
                           He falls into several great faults, and dies despoiled of his glorious vestments, to shew the abrogation of his priesthood.
                           The pagans have, perhaps, introduced some parts of his history into that of Mercury, the god of thieves and of travellers,
                           the messenger of the other gods, whom they adorn with a wand, &amp;c., in imitation of the <I>rod</I> of Aaron, who was the
                           <I>interpreter</I> of Moses, and the head of that people, which <I>wandered</I> for 40 years, after <I>plundering</I> Egypt.
