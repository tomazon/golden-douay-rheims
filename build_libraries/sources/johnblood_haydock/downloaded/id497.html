                           any thing repugnant to the spirit of my law. No interpretation of this kind can be admitted. But this does not condemn well
                           authorized traditions, and laws enacted by lawful superiors. The Jews always boast of their close adherence to the letter
                           of the law, but they often forget the spirit of it, and by their traditions render it deformed, like a carcass. Demosthenes
                           takes notice, that the Locrians had such a regard for their laws, that if any one chose to propose any fresh ones, he came
                           with a rope about his neck, that if they did not meet with the approbation of the people, he might be strangled immediately.
                           (Calmet) --- Moses cannot mean to forbid any more divine or civil commandments being written by Josue and the subsequent prophets.
                           He only enjoins that nothing shall be altered by human authority. The other books of the Old Testament serve to explain the
                           law; and so do the apostolical traditions (Worthington) afford great assistance to understand the true meaning of all the
                           Scriptures, and hence we learn whatever we have to perform, without danger of being led astray. (Haydock) --- To these the
                           Scriptures frequently refer. <I>He that heareth you, heareth me,</I> Luke x. <I>Hold the traditions which you have learnt,</I>
                           2 Thessalonians ii. <I>The rest I will set in order, when I come,</I> 1 Corinthians xi. 34. Hence St. Augustine (contra Cresc.
                           i. 33) observes, "Though no evident example can be produced from Scripture, yet we hold the truth of the same Scripture, when
                           we do what meets with the approbation of that Church whose authority the Scripture establishes." See ep. 80, St. Chrysostom
                           in 1 Thess. iv.; St. Irenæus, Against Heresies iii. 4. (Worthington) --- The Jews themselves never had the folly to imagine
                           with the modern innovators, that all laws both of a religous or civil nature were here proscribed. Under David, Mardocheus,
                           and the Machabees, various laws and feasts were commanded, and observed in the true spirit of the law, 1 Kings xxx. 25., and
                           Esther ix., and 1 Machabees iv. God does not leave to the discretion of the Jews, the appointing of different victims, &amp;c.,
                           in his worship, (chap. xii. 30,) as they might very easily give way to the superstitious observances of their neighbours,
                           and these things had been sufficiently determined. But he enjoins all to obey the declarations of the priests and judges,
                           chap. xvii. 10. (Bellarmine) (Tirinus) --- Thus when the Apocalypse records a prohibition similar to this, (Apocalypse xxii.
                           18, 19,) it is not intended to seal up the divine volume, so that nothing more shall be admitted into it, for St. John wrote
                           his gospel afterwards. But it must be explained in the same sense as this passage, and condemns all those who, of their own
                           authority, would set up fresh doctrine in opposition to the word of God. Let Protestants consider if they be not concerned
                           in this caution, when they not only cut off whole books of Scripture, but deny the authority of the Church itself, without
                           which the Scripture can be of little service. They are the book <I>sealed with seven seals,</I> impenetrable to man without
                           the aid of the divine author; (Apocalypse v. 5,) and this aid he will never grant to those who obstinately refuse to <I>hear
                           the Church,</I> Matthew xviii. 17., and 2 Peter i. 20. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           (Menochius) --- Solomon often inculcates the same truths, Proverbs i. 7., and Ecclesiasticus i. 34. Even profane writers applauded
                           the laws and fidelity of the Jews. See Josephus, Jewish Wars i. 5.; Strabo xvi. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           to us? The idols are nothing but <I>devils,</I> which seek to destroy. (Calmet) --- But God had manifested his power and love
                           to the Hebrews in the most astonishing manner. He seemed to choose his residence among them, in the tabernacle. (Haydock)
                           --- This Jesus does in a still more wonderful manner, with respect to Christians, remaining with them in the sacrament of
                           love. The other sacraments which he has instituted, are more noble and efficacious than those of the old law. He was pleased
                           to take our nature, (Calmet) and to <I>dwell among us,</I> John i. The providence of God pervades all things; and, though
                           all live <I>in Him,</I> (Acts xvii. 28,) yet he shews the marks of the most paternal tenderness to his elect. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Most of these laws had been already promulgated, so that the people could set a just value upon them. But Moses undertakes
                           to place the in a more beautiful point of view, as it were altogether, and accompanied with some fresh regulations. How imperfect
                           are all the codes of the ancient lawgivers, when compared with this of Moses! (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew also, "things." (Haydock) --- Both sacred and profane authors use the term of <I>seeing,</I> to denote any of the senses,

                           Josephus (Antiquities iii. 4, 6,) says, that each table contained five precepts, two and a half being inscribed on one side.
                           The Jews now suppose that four appeared on one table, and six on the other. But each table probably contained an entire copy
                           of the law. (Calmet) --- It hence appears, that there are just ten precepts. (Worthington) --- But the manner of dividing
                           them is rather uncertain. St. Augustine and Catholics in general, place the three commandments, which regard God, by themselves.
                           See Exodus xx. 1. Their greater importance and length would require as much space as the other seven, which ascertain the
                           mutual duties of people to each other. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew, "Be therefore particularly attentive, as much as you love your own soul." (Vatable) By keeping my commandments, you
                           can alone obtain salvation, ver. 9. (Menochius) --- <I>Similitude</I> of any living creature, such as were the objects of
                           adoration among the pagans. Some represented their gods under the forms of men, women, beasts, birds, or reptiles; while others
                           adored the sun, moon, and stars. (Haydock) --- This last was indeed the most ancient species of idolatry, Job xxi. 26. Baal,
                           Astarte, Moloc, Chamos, &amp;c., were different names by which they denoted the heavenly bodies. But the Egyptians carried
                           their superstition to the greatest excess. There was hardly any sort of animal which did not obtain sovereign worship among
                           them. (Calmet) --- Their great gods, Isis and Osiris, were sometimes depicted like a man and woman; at other times, like beasts,
                           and frequently they appeared with parts of both. The head of Isis was generally adorned or disfigured with the horns of a
                           bull; (Haydock) and that animal, either alive or in a picture, as well as dogs and cats, were adored throughout the country,
                           while some places had their peculiar idols. The lion, the wolf, and the fish called <I>latus,</I> gave their names to the
                           cities Leontopolis, &amp;c., which had a particular veneration for them. Moses takes care to inform the Hebrews, that the
                           true God is like none of these things; and that they cannot pretend to represent him under any such forms, without doing him
                           an injury. (Calmet) --- If Catholics endeavour to put the people in mind of the blessed Trinity, by representing a venerable
                           old man, Jesus Christ in his human nature, and a dove, under which forms the Scripture has introduced the three divine persons,
                           they do not pretend that their divine and most spiritual nature can be thus expressed. "If," says the Council of Trent, Session
                           25, "the historical accounts of Scripture be sometimes set forth in paintings, for the benefit of the illiterate, let the
                           people be informed that the Divinity is not thus represented, with a design to insinuate that it may be seen with the eyes
                           of the body." So neither can the figure of a triangle, with the ineffable name of God in Hebrew, &amp;c., explain this adorable
                           mystery. But such things may recall to our remembrance, the innumerable benefits which we have received from the three divine
                           persons, after we have been once informed what we have to believe respecting them. This is the laudable motive which has induced
                           the Church to encourage the keeping of such pictures, as well as those of the saints, with due respect. "Not as if we believed
                           that any divinity or virtue resided in them for which they were to be worshipped, or that we should ask any thing of them,
                           or place our confidence in images, as the Gentiles formerly did, who hoped in their idols, (Psalm cxxxiv.,) but because the
                           honour given to them is referred to the originals, which they represent," &amp;c. (Council of Trent, Session 25.) (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew, "with all thy soul. (Ver. 30) In thy tribulation after," &amp;c. (Calmet) --- God often sends chastisements as the
                           most effectual means of salvation, to make his children enter into themselves. In this state, the soul is more at liberty
                           to consider the folly of adhering to any thing in opposition to the sovereign Lord. Then she is forced to confess that her
                           idols cannot afford her any protection. How, in effect, could any one fall into such an abyss of corruption and stupidity,
                           as to imagine those things to be gods which have not even the dignity and advantages which they themselves possess? Their
                           soul must first have been strangely blinded, and their heart corrupt. Even the more enlightened pagans acknowledged the folly
                           of pretending to represent the Divinity under sensible forms. "God, says Empedocles, has no human members....He is a pure
                           and ineffable spirit, who governs the world by his profound wisdom." Numa would not allow any picture of Him, conformably
                           to the doctrine of Pythagoras; and, for the first 170 years of Rome, no representation of God was set up in the temples. (Plutarch)
                           --- The ancient Ph&#339;nicians seemed to have acted on the same principle, as the temple of Hercules, at the Straits, had
                           no image. It is well known that the Persians rejected both the statues and temples erected in honour of the gods; and the
                           Germans esteemed it beneath the majesty of the heavenly Beings, to represent them under any human form. (Tacitus, Hist. v.)
                           (Calmet) --- Yet these sages gave way to the folly of the people, and, against their better knowledge, adored the stupid and
