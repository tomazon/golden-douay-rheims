                           Pilate's motive, for ordering our Saviour to be scourged, was no other than this; that the Jews might be satisfied with these
                           his numerous sufferings, and might no longer seek his death. For the same reason, likewise, he permitted his soldiers to inflict
                           those unheard of cruelties, related in the sequel. (St. Augustine, tract. 110. in Joan.)</font></p><b>

                           Some expound this of Judas; others, rather of the high priest Caiphas, with the Jewish council: for they could not be ignorant
                           that Jesus was their Messias, having seen the miracles Jesus did, and knowing the predictions of the prophets. (Witham) ---
                           Lest any should think, from what our Saviour had said, that Pilate was not in fault, in this place, he here adds, that he
                           that had delivered him up, had the greater sin: God, indeed, had permitted it; but still these instruments of his death were
                           not without fault. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxxxiii. in Joan.) --- Christ had been delivered into the power of Pilate through
                           envy, and Pilate was about to exercise that power through fear. But though this last motive of fear can never justify any
                           one, who condemns the innocent, yet still it is much more pardonable than the motive of envy, which was the incentive of the
                           Jewish multitude. (St. Augustine, tract. 116. in Joan.) --- Judas delivered Jesus into the hands of the priests, but both
                           the priests and the people delivered him up to Pontius Pilate.</font></p><b>

                           <i>The Parasceve of the Pasch;</i> that is, the day before the paschal sabbath. The eve of every sabbath was called the Parasceve,
                           or day of preparation. But this was the eve of a high sabbath, viz. that which fell in the paschal week. (Challoner) --- It
                           was about the sixth hour when they crucified him. St. Mark, in his gospel, says, it was at the third hour that Jesus was crucified.
                           These two evangelists are easily reconciled, if we consider that according to the custom of the Jews, all that took place
                           between the third hour and the sixth hour of their day, was said to have happened in the third hour: their days being divided
                           into four parts of three hours each, in the same manner as the nights were into four watches, of three hours each. St. Mark,
                           therefore, might say very well, that the crucifixion of our Saviour took place in the third hour: though it might have been
                           towards the conclusion of this general division of the day: whilst St. John, with a reason equally as good, says that it happened
                           about the sixth hour. (John Nicolaus, in his marginal notes on St. Thomas Aquinas' Aurea Catena.)</font></p><b>

                           St. John makes no mention of what took place on the way to Calvary, when Jesus, being worn out by fatigue, could not proceed
                           any farther, and they were obliged to relieve him of his burden, and to give it to a man, named Simon, of Cyrene, to carry
                           for him, as is related in St. Matthew xxvii. 32. and St. Mark xv. 21. (Calmet) --- For the honour paid in the early ages to
                           the holy cross see St. Cyril, lib. vi. cont. Julian.; St. Jerome, ep. xvii.; St. Paulin. ep. xi.</font></p><b>

                           He is the king, not of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles also. But it is not without reason, that he is called king of the
                           Jews. For they were the true olive (Romans xi.); and we, the wild olive, have been ingrafted, and made partakers of the virtue
                           of the true olive. Christ, therefore, is the king of the Jews, circumcised, not in the flesh, but in the heart, not according
                           to the letter, but the spirit. (St. Augustine, tract. 118. in Joan.)</font></p><b>

                           As there were probably many Gentiles at Jerusalem at this time, on account of the festival day, this inscription was written

                           but his under garment, or vest, was <i>without seam,</i> so that being cut, it would have been of no use. (Witham) --- This
                           coat without seam is a figure of the unity of the Church. (St. Cyprian, de unit. Eccles.) --- The Rev. Fred. Nolan, of Woodford,
                           in Essex, in his late work, entitled, <i>Objections of a Churchman to uniting with the Bible Society,</i> after quoting 2
                           Peter iii. 15, 16, says: "That the Bible may, therefore, prove the remote, but innocent cause of harm, is not, I apprehend,
                           to be disputed, if we are to admit of its own authority:" p. 23, and again, p. 24, "that the present mode of circulating the
                           Scriptures must prove a most effectual specific for multiplying sects and schisms; and consequently, for increasing, to an
                           infinite degree, the greatest evil, under which Christianity has suffered, from the time of its promulgation, down to the
                           memorable epoch of this happy invention, for the establishment of Christian <i>faith,</i> and the extension of Christian <i>unanimity."</i>
                           P. 62., in the same work, "That the Bible is the foundation of our religion, is new doctrine, unless in the divinity of the
                           conventicle. We are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.
                           (Ephesians ii. 20.) On this foundation others still build, who are labourers together with God; (1 Corinthians xi. 9. 10.)
                           of which divine co-operation the successors of the apostles have an express promise, to the end of the world. (Matthew xxviii.
                           20.) And by persons thus authorized (John xx. 21.) apostolical tradition has been delivered down to the present day, p. 63.
                           The <i>one body,</i> of which our Lord was resolved his Church should consist, was to have <i>one faith,</i> (Ephesians iv.
                           4, 5.) it was to contain <i>no schism,</i> (1 Corinthians xii. 25.) but the present confederacy is formed on the principle
                           of combining every sect and party, and this, while we have received an express prohibition against associating with those,
                           who reject apostolical traditions, committed to the Church." (2 Thessalonians iii. 6. 14.) In a foot-note on the above, the
                           learned divine very appositely cites St. Ignatius, in which quotation we find these emphatic words:&nbsp;<i><u>Me planasthe
                           adelphoi mou, ei tis schizonti akolouthei, Basileian theou ou Kleronomei</u>.</i> Be not deceived, my brethren, not only acknowledged
                           schismatics, but whoever shall join with a schismatic, shall not inherit the kingdom of God. The same apostolic Father, in
                           another part, adds: he who corrupts the faith of God, for which Christ suffered, shall go into unquenchable fire:&nbsp;<i><u>eis
                           to pur to asbeston choresei</u>.</i> St. Alexander, in the fourth century, says of the Arians: that seamless garment, which
                           the murderers of Jesus Christ would not divide, these men have dared to rip asunder.&nbsp;<i><u>Tou arrekton chitona schisai

                           Friday, the year Christ suffered, was not the first and great day of the <i>feast of Azyms,</i> but only the day of preparation,
                           and that on Friday night the Jews eat the paschal lamb, and not the night before, or Thursday night, as Christ had done with
                           his disciples. But according to the common exposition, Friday is here called <i>the day of preparation,</i> for the great
                           and solemn sabbath, which happened in the paschal week. See Tillemont on the 5th passage out of John, p. 698, section 11.
