                           such young widows, of whom he is speaking, that are like to do worse. Thus it is expounded by St. Jerome to Sabina:[6] "Let
                           her rather take a husband than the devil." And in another epistle, to Ageruchia: "It is better to take a second husband than
                           many adulterers." St. Chrysostom[7] on this verse: I will, or would have such to marry, because they themselves will do it.

                           some are already turned aside after Satan,</I> by breaking the vows they had made. "Yet it does not follow, (says St. Augustine
                           in the same place [de Bono viduitatis, chap. viii.]) that they who abstain not from such sins may marry after their vows.
                           They might indeed marry before they vowed; but this being done, unless they keep them they justly incur damnation." "Why is
                           it, (says he again, on Psalm lxxv.) they made void their first faith? but that they made vows, and kept them not. But let
                           not this (says he) make you abstain from such vows, for you are not to comply with them by your own strength; you will fall,
                           if you presume on yourselves; but if you confide in him to whom you made these vows, you will securely comply with them."
                           How different was the doctrine and practice of the first and chief of the late pretended reformers, who were many of them
                           apostates after such vows? (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>Some men's sins are manifest,</I> &amp;c. These two verses seem connected with the admonition before given, as to ordaining
                           ministers, some men's sins and evil life being so manifest, that they are certain to be rejected. --- <I>And some men they
                           follow after:</I> they appear not till after a trial and examination. --- <I>In like manner also good deeds,</I> and good
                           lives of some men, are so manifest, that they are easily admitted. And such as <I>are otherwise,</I> (that is, when they are
                           desirous to conceal their virtues) they <I>cannot be hidden:</I> by an examination and trial they will appear. (Witham) ---
                           This refers to what he had said before, that he ought not easily to ordain others, but pass his judgment with scrutiny and
                           impartiality. But there are some whom the public voice already condemns; their crimes are manifest: and there are others,
                           though bad, whose crimes cannot be proved without examination. (Calmet) --- St. Basil thinks it refers to the general judgment.
                           Many both good and bad actions are at present manifest: others shall not be known till the day of judgment. Hypocrites are
                           reserved to be judged by the Lord, as we cannot pronounce upon their actions. (St. Basil, lib. de Virgin.)</FONT></P>
