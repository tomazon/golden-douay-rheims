                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 He gathered together a very great multitude, and they stopped up all

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 For with him is an arm of flesh: with us the Lord, our God, who is

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 Doth not Ezechias deceive you, to give you up to die, by hunger and

                                    when he was come into the house of his god, his sons that came out of his bowels, slew him with the sword.</font></p>
