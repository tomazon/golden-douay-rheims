                           our Saviour, after he had tried all possible remedies, after he had taught and confirmed his doctrines by innumerable miracles,
                           after he had secretly by his parables reprehended them for their wickedness, but without effect, now publicly upbraids their
                           vices. But before his reprehension of the Pharisees, he instructs the people, lest they should despise the authority of the

                           disclosing to them his will. Such, therefore, as did not depart from the letter of the law, were called Scribes. But such
                           as professed something higher, and separated themselves from the crowd, as better than the ordinary class of men, were called
                           <I>Pharisees,</I> which signifies, separated. (Origen) --- God preserveth the truth of the Christian religion in the apostolic
                           See of Rome, which in the new law answers to the chair of Moses, notwithstanding the disedifying conduct of some few of its

                           of the faith of God's Church, or to the ready obedience and perfect submission of sincere good Christians, for whom our Lord
                           has made this provision, when he says: <I>do that which they say, but do not as they do.</I> (St. Augustine, Ep. clxv.)</FONT></P><B>

                           </I>"Why dost thou call the apostolic chair the chair of pestilence? If, for the men that sit therein, I ask: did our Lord
                           Jesus Christ, on account of the Pharisees, reflect upon the chair, wherein they sat? Did he not commend that chair of Moses,
                           and, preserving the honour of the chair, reprove them? For he sayeth: they <I>have sat on the chair of Moses. All therefore
                           whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do.</I> These points if you did well consider, you would not, for the men whom
                           you defame, blaspheme the Apostolic See, wherewith you do not hold communion." (lib. ii. chap. 51) And again, chap. 61 Ibid.
                           "Neither on account of the Pharisees, to whom you maliciously compare us, did our Lord command the chair of Moses to be forsaken;
                           (in which chair he verily figured his own) for he warned the people to do what they say, and not what they do, and that <I>the
                           holiness of the chair be in no case forsaken, nor the unity of the flock divided,</I> on account of the wicked lives of the
                           pastors." --- Christ does not tell them to observe every thing, without exception, that the Pharisees should say to them;
                           for, (as it was observed in a previous chapter) many superstitions and false ordinances had obtained amongst them, corrupting
                           the Scriptures by their traditions; but only such as were not contrary to the law of Moses. We are taught to obey <I>bad</I>
                           no less than <I>good</I> ministers, in those things that are not expressly contrary to the law of God. Hence appears how unfounded
                           and unreasonable is the excuse so often adduced by persons in justification of their misdeeds, viz. that they saw their pastors
                           do the same. Such must attend to the rule here given by Jesus Christ. What they say, do: but according to their works, do
                           ye not. (Denis the Carthusian) --- The words, <I>all whatsoever,</I> shew that nothing must be excepted, but what the supreme
                           law orders to be excepted. (Estius)</FONT></P><B>

                           These were pieces or scrolls of parchment, on which were written the ten commandments, or some sentences of the law, which
                           the Jews were accustomed to fasten to their foreheads, or their arms, to put them in mind of their duty. Thus they interpreted
                           those words. (Deuteronomy vi. 8.) <I>Thou shalt tie them as a sign on thy hand: and they shall be, and move before thy eyes.</I>
                           Perhaps all the Jews, and even our Saviour himself, wore them; and that he only blames the hypocrisy and vanity of the Scribes
                           and Pharisees, who affected to have them larger than others; and they did the like as to the fringes which the Jews wore on
                           their garments. (Witham) --- That is, parchments, on which they wrote the ten commandments, and carried on their foreheads
                           before their eyes: which the Pharisees affected to wear broader than other men: so to seem more zealous for the law. (Challoner)
                           --- The word <I>Phylacterion,</I> which is found both in the Greek and Latin Vulgate, properly signifies a preservation. It
                           was a piece of parchment which the Jews carried round their heads from one ear to the other, and round their arms like bracelets,
                           and upon which were written certain words of the law. Since the origin of the sect of Pharisees, they began to attach to these
                           bands of parchment chimerical virtues, such as preservatives of maladies, and preservations from the insults of devils; hence
                           the name <I>phylacterion.</I> (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>

                           to you blind guides.</I> Avarice seems to have been the chief motive of the Pharisees in teaching this doctrine, since they
                           taught that those who swore by the temple were guilty of no sin, nor under any obligation at all; whereas they who swore by
                           the gold of the temple, were bound to pay a certain sum of money to the priests, by which they themselves were enriched. (Nicholas
                           of Lyra.) --- <I>Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing,</I> &amp;c. To understand this obscure place, we may
                           take notice, that a good part of what was offered on the altar, and given to the treasury of the temple, fell to the share
                           of the Jewish priests; and therefore it was not their interest to have such promises or oaths dispensed with. This made them
                           teach the people, that if any one had made a promissory oath or vow to give their money or goods <I>to the temple,</I> or
                           <I>to the altar</I> itself, as it is said ver. 18, such oaths or promises were not obligatory, or might easily be dispensed
                           with. But if any one had sworn or vowed to give any thing to the <I>treasury of the temple,</I> or join it to the <I>offerings
                           to be made</I> on the altar, then such oaths and promises which turned to their profit were by all means to be kept. St. Jerome
                           expounds it of oaths in common discourse; as if they taught the people, that when any one swore <I>by the temple,</I> or&nbsp;<I>the
                           altar,</I> it was not so considerable as to swear by <I>the gold in the temple,</I> or <I>by the offerings</I> there made:
                           for in the latter cases, they were to make satisfaction according to the judgment of the Jewish priests. And to correct their
                           covetous proceedings, Christ tells them that the temple and the altar were greater than the gold and the offerings. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           to you.</I> Jesus Christ here condemns, in forcible language, the principal vices of the Pharisees, viz. their hypocrisy,
                           false devotion, boundless ambition, insatiable avarice, false zeal, and ignorance in deciding upon cases of conscience. St.
                           Luke represents our Saviour as saying this to the Pharisees at dinner; (Chap. xi.) so that Christ must either have repeated
                           these things at different times; or, St. Matthew according to custom, must have added them to other words of our Saviour,
                           which, though spoken on another occasion, had some connection with the same subject. In vain do you, Pharisees, boast of your
                           external sanctity. Do not imagine, that fornication, adultery, and other actions, are the only sins to be attended to; and
                           that pride, avarice, anger, and other spiritual sins, are of no moment. He who made the body, made also the soul; and it is
                           of equal consequence that both be kept clean and free from sin. (Nicholas of Lyra.) --- By the similitude of the cup, and
                           of whited sepulchres, as also that of building the sepulchres of the prophets, he shews that they did all their actions purposely
                           to be seen by men, and that this was their only motive in all they did. (Idem. [Nicholas of Lyra.]) --- Like Ezekiel's bitter
                           roll, we have here a dreadful list of woes, like as many thunderbolts, levelled against hypocrisy, avarice, ambition, and
                           all bitter zeal. We should be careful not to suffer such rank weeds to grow up in our soil, to the ruin of all good.</FONT></P><B>

                           but we do not read of his being murdered in this manner. The more common opinion is, that here is meant Zachary, who, preaching
                           to the people, (2 Paralipomenon xxiv. 20,) was stoned to death in the very place where Christ was now speaking. But there
                           he is called the <I>son of Joiada,</I> and not <I>of Barachias.</I> Some conjecture his father might have had both names;
                           and St. Jerome tells us, that in an ancient copy of St. Matthew, called the <I>Gospel of the Nazarenes,</I> he found this
                           Zacharias, of whom our Saviour speaks, called the son of Joiada. (Witham) --- St. Jerome gives another reason why he might
                           have been called the son of Barachias, and not the son of Joiada, and this is to commend the sanctity of the father; for <I>Barachias</I>
                           is interpreted the blessed of the Lord. Others suppose that he was the 11th of the 12 prophets; but it is not mentioned that
                           he was slain between the temple and the altar. Some surmise that it was the father of the Baptist, collecting from the apocryphal
                           writings that he was killed for preaching the arrival of the Redeemer: but that he was the son of Joiada, otherwise called
                           Barachias, is the common opinion. (St. Jerome) --- <I>That upon you may come,</I> &amp;c. Not that they should suffer more
                           than their own sins richly deserved; but that the justice of God should now fall upon them with such a final vengeance once
                           for all, as might comprise all the different kinds of judgments and punishments, that had at any time before been inflicted
                           for the shedding of just blood. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>
