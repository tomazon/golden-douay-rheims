                           He says that it represents the Gentiles, who were converted to the faith by the apostles. The legion represents the innumerable
                           vices to which they were subject, neither restrained by the laws of God nor man, but breaking through every restraint, and
                           wallowing in all kinds of uncleanness. (Ven. Bede) --- The three evangelists agree in the expulsion of the legion of devils,
                           except that St. Matthew makes mention of two demoniacs, and Sts. Mark and Luke only of one. The difficulty is thus solved
                           by St. Augustine. St. Mark and St. Luke only mention one, as being more generally known, and particularly frightful in the
                           neighbourhood. (St. Augustine)</FONT></FONT></P><B>
