                           Nothing could be more just and prudent; as this decision prevents continual murmurs and inconveniences. Those who are left
                           behind, are bound to defend the baggage at the hazard of their lives, and each man must obey the orders of the general. Hence
                           all nations seem to have adopted similar regulations, though Achilles declaims against it. (Homer, Iliad i.) --- Coriolanus
                           observes, that formerly the Romans brought all the spoil into the public treasury. (Halicar. vii.) --- The soldiers promised
                           on oath to bring all they should take, and an equal division was made to the whole army. (Polyb. x.) --- The sick and absent
                           also partook of the plunder. (Calmet) --- The same was observed by the Machabees, 2 Machabees viii. 28. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           to its full vigour this ancient regulation. The Hebrews have no compound verbs, such as re-establish, re-build, &amp;c., instead

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 For the two wives also of David were taken captives, Achinoam, the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And David was greatly afflicted: for the people had a mind to stone
                                    him, for the soul of every man was bitterly grieved for his sons and daughters: but David took courage in the Lord his God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And he said to Abiathar, the priest, the son of Achimelech: Bring me

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I pursue after these robbers,
                                    and shall I overtake them, or not? And the Lord said to him: Pursue after them: for thou shalt surely overtake them and recover
                                    the prey.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and they
                                    came to the torrent Besor: and some, being weary, stayed there.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred stayed,
                                    who, being weary, could not go over the torrent Besor.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David:
                                    and they gave him bread to eat, and water to drink,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 As also a piece of a cake of figs, and two bunches of raisins. And
                                    when he had eaten them, his spirit returned, and he was refreshed: for he had not eaten bread, nor drunk water three days
                                    and three nights.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And David said to him: To whom dost thou belong; or whence dost thou
                                    come? and whither art thou going? He said: I am a young man of Egypt, the servant of an Amalecite, and my master left me,
                                    because I began to be sick three days ago.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 For we made an invasion on the south side of Cerethi, and upon Juda,
                                    and upon the south of Caleb, and we burnt Siceleg with fire.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And David said to him: Canst thou bring me to this company? and he
                                    said: Swear to me by God, that thou wilt not kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee to
                                    this company. And David swore to him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And when he had brought him, behold they were lying spread upon all
                                    the ground, eating and drinking, and as it were keeping a festival day, for all the prey and the spoils which they had taken
                                    out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Juda.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And David slew them from the evening unto the evening of the next
                                    day, and there escaped not a man of them, but four hundred young men, who had gotten upon camels, and fled.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 So David recovered all that the Amalecites had taken, and he rescued
                                    his two wives.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And there was nothing missing small or great, neither of their sons
                                    or their daughters, nor of the spoils, and whatsoever they had taken, David recovered all.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And he took all the flocks and the herds, and made them go before
                                    him: and they said: This is the prey of David.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And David came to the two hundred men, who, being weary, had stayed,
                                    and were not able to follow David, and he had ordered them to abide at the torrent Besor: and they came out to meet David,
                                    and the people that were with him. And David coming to the people, saluted them peaceably.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 Then all the wicked and unjust men, that had gone with David, answering,
                                    said: Because they came not with us, we will not give them any thing of the prey which we have recovered: but let every man
                                    take his wife, and his children, and be contented with them, and go his way.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 But David said: You shall not do so, my brethren, with these things,
                                    which the Lord hath given us, who hath kept us, and hath delivered the robbers that invaded us into our hands:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And no man shall hearken to you in this matter. But equal shall be

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And this hath been done from that day forward, and since was made

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 Then David came to Siceleg, and sent presents of the prey to the ancients
