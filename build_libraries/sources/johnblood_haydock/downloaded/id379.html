                           Calvisius observes, that from Ephraim alone might have sprung 4,112,323,729 people. See St. Augustine, q. 43, &amp;c. (Haydock)
                           --- In the space of 215 years, 70 people may produce an immense multitude, as Bonfrere shews by an accurate calculation. God
                           also was pleased to bless the Hebrews with fecundity, so that they <I>sprung up</I> (<I>ebullierunt</I>) like frogs or fishes,
                           ver. 7. In Egypt, the women had sometimes seven at a birth (Pliny, Natural History vii. 3,) and Aristotle (Anim. vii. 4,)
                           mentions one woman who had 20 children at four births. (Tirinus) --- <I>Stronger.</I> This might easily be true, if this king
                           had only Thebais under his command. But if he was king of all Egypt, it seems an exaggeration. (Calmet) --- Indeed, human
                           policy often gives birth to all kinds of wickedness. The king justifies his cruelty on this pretext of self-defence. He wishes
                           to keep the Hebrews under; yet he is not willing to let them depart, as he knew they intended, according to Joseph's prediction.
                           (Haydock) --- God permitted this disposition, in order to punish his people for their idolatry, (Ezechiel xxiii. 8,) to admonish
                           them not to fix their abode in Egypt, and to manifest his power and glory in the destruction of the impious. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           them with heavy burdens of brick and tile. Hence Aristophanes calls the Hebrews in derision <I>Plinthophoroi.</I> This servitude

                           By this allusion they not only excuse themselves, but seem also to enter into the king's sentiments of hatred and scorn for
                           the Hebrews. (Menochius) --- Women in Egypt, and in the eastern regions, are easily delivered, and hardly stand in need of
                           any assistance. (Ludolf) (1 Kings iv. 19.) Perhaps, therefore, the midwives spoke truth, with regard to the generality of
                           the Hebrew women. But they gave way to a lie of excuse, with regard to some, (ver. 17,) which St. Augustine would not allow,
                           even to save all the Hebrew children. (contra Mend. 15.) It was not so easy to discover this delusion, as women in that country
                           seldom appear in public; and hence Jochabed was enabled to hide Moses so long. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           graces. (Worthington) --- Some conclude from this verse, that the midwives embraced the true religion. The Hebrew refers <I>built
                           them</I> to the Hebrews, as if they multiplied in consequence of the humanity of these women; (Calmet) and the Vulgate may
                           be explained in the same sense. (Haydock) De Muis supposes, that Pharao ordered houses to be built for the midwives, where
                           the Hebrew women were forced to appear when they were to be delivered, in the presence of commissaries.</FONT></P><B>
