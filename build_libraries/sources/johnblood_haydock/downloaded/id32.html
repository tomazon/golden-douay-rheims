                           <I>Tetrarch.</I> This word, derived from the Greek, signifies one that rules over the fourth part of a kingdom: as <I>Herod</I>
                           then ruled over <I>Galilee,</I> which was but the fourth part of the kingdom of his father. (Challoner) --- St. John had been
                           now imprisoned in the castle of Mach√¶rus about a year, at the instigation of Herodias. It is very probable that before this
                           he would have fallen a sacrifice to her vindictive temper, had it not been for the great personal respect in which (on account
                           of the singular holiness of his life) he was held, not only by the people, but by Herod himself. --- Josephus, in his <I>Antiquities
                           of the Jews,</I> gives the following account: This Herod, who was also called Antipas, was the son of Herod the great, by
                           his sixth wife, Cleopatra, of Jerusalem. A general opinion obtained among the Jews, that Herod's discomfiture by the Parthians,
                           was the effect of divine vengeance upon himself and his army, for the blood of John, surnamed the Baptist. He was a man of
                           immaculate character, whose object was to exhort the Jews to the practice of virtue and piety, point out the necessity of
                           repentance, and hold forth by baptism the import of regeneration to a new life, which he made to consist, not in abstaining
                           from a particular sin, but in an habitual purity of both mind and body. Such was the influence of this great and good man,
                           as appeared from the multitude of his disciples, and the veneration of his life and doctrines, that Herod was apprehensive
                           of a revolt. He therefore sent him bound to prison, where by the malice of Herodias, his brother's wife, he was afterwards
                           put to death, which inhuman act was shortly followed by the marked vengeance of heaven on its execrable author, as the Jews
                           were firmly convinced. (Book xviii, chap. vii.) --- For Herod going to Rome, at the instigation of Herodias, expecting to
                           be made king, was severely reproved by the emperor Caius, (Caligula) who transferred his tetrarchy to Agrippa, in consequence
                           of which, Herod retired with his wife to Spain, and died in exile. (<I>Wars of the Jews.</I> Book ii, chap. viii.) In the
                           18th book, and 9th chapter, Josephus says, the place of his exile was Lyons, in Gaul; that his goods were also confiscated,
                           and that both himself and Herodias died in great misery.</FONT></P><B>

                           him; and yet he is terrified with the thought of violating a vain and wicked oath on no occasion and in no circumstances obligatory.
                           Herod did wrong in taking such a rash oath, but he did worse in fulfilling it. (Jansenius) --- David swore to kill Nabal.
                           He swore rashly; but with greater piety, he refused to keep his oath. Perhaps it is because Catholics inculcate this principle,
                           that they have been accused by their adversaries of teaching that faith is not to be kept, and also the doctrine of expediency.

                           personage ever born of woman, cast into prison, and, after a year's confinement, slain at the request of an impious vile adulteress.

                           when Jesus had heard.</I> Our Saviour did not retire till he was informed of the death of the Baptist, by message; and this
                           he did, not because he was ignorant of it before, but that he might shew to the world, not only by his appearance, but also
                           by his manner of acting, the reality of the mystery of his incarnation. (St. Chrysostom, hom. 1.) --- He did not retire through
                           fear, as some may think. Hence the evangelist does not say, <I>he fled,</I> but <I>he retired,</I> to shew us that he did
                           not fear his enemies. (St. Jerome) --- The desert was called of Bethsaida, not because it was on the same side of the town,
                           but opposite it. Wherefore those who wished to join Jesus, not able to pass the lake, went round by the northern extremity,
                           which they passed either by means of a bridge or in boats, and made such haste as to arrive at the desert before Jesus Christ,
                           as St. Mark relates; (vi. 33.) whilst others, not equally expeditious, followed after, according to Sts. Matthew, Luke, and
                           John; so that there is no contradiction in the evangelists. (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>

                           the first began when the sun was declining, about three in the afternoon; and such was the evening here mentioned. The second
                           evening was after sunset, or the night-time, as it is taken here in this chap. ver. 23 (Witham) --- <I>That ... they may buy.</I>
                           Jesus Christ does not always anticipate the intentions of his supplicants: on this occasion, he waited for the multitude to

                           Jesus said.</I> It may perhaps be asked here, if then our Lord, as St. John relates, looking upon the multitude, inquired
                           of Philip how so great a multitude could be fed in the desert, how can this be true, which St. Matthew relates, that the disciples
                           first desired Jesus to send away the multitude? But we are to understand, that after these words our Lord looked upon the
                           multitude, and said to Philip what St. John mentions, which St. Matthew and the other evangelists omit. (St. Augustine, de
                           concord. evang.) --- <I>They have no need to go: give you them to eat.</I> This he says for our instruction, that when the
                           poor ask us alms, we send them not to other persons and other places, if we are able to relieve them ourselves. (Estius) ---
                           This happened when the Passover was near at hand, (being the third since the commencement of our Saviour's ministry.) St.
                           John does not usually relate what is mentioned by the other evangelists, especially what happened in Galilee. If he does it
                           on this occasion, it is in order to introduce the subject of the heavenly bread, vi. 37.[31.?] He seems also to have had in
                           view to describe the different Passovers during Christ's preaching. As he, therefore, staid in Galilee during the third Passover,
                           he relates pretty fully his transactions during that time.</FONT></P><B>

                           in the hands of Christ, when he broke them, partly in the hands of the disciples, when they distributed them about. (Witham)
                           --- <I>He blessed and brake.</I> From this let Christians learn to give thanks at their meals, begging of God that his gifts
                           may be sanctified for their use. From this miracle it appears, that it is no impossibility for bodies, even in their natural
                           state, to be in many places at the same time; since, supposing these loaves to have been sufficient for 50 persons, as there
                           were a hundred such companies, the loaves must have been in a hundred different places at one and the same time. It cannot
                           be said, as some pretend, that other loaves were invisibly put into the apostles' hands, since it is said that they filled
                           12 baskets of fragments of the five barley loaves; and again, he divided the two fishes among them all. If God could cause
                           bodies, in their natural state, to be in many places at one and the same time, how much more easy would it be to do the same
                           with spiritual bodies, with the properties of which we are entirely unacquainted; so that from this it appears, that the objection
                           that Christ's body cannot be in many different places in the holy Eucharist, is nugatory. But, who are we, to ask such a question
                           of the Almighty, who know not what is possible, and what is not possible for him to do! (Bp. Hay, Sincere Christian.)</FONT></P><B>
