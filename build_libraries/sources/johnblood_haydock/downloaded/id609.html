                           <i>my</i> son, for I believe all that the prophet, Jonas, spoke concerning Ninive, that it will be overturned. But in Media
                           there will be more peace for a time, and that our brethren in the land will be scattered from the good land; and Jerusalem
                           shall be deserted, and the house of God in it will be burnt, and shall be abandoned for a time; and they shall build the house,
                           not like the former, till the times of the world <i>or</i> age be accomplished; and afterwards they shall return from the
                           captives, and shall build Jerusalem gloriously; and the house of God shall be built in it, and the edifice shall be glorious
                           for ever, as the prophets have spoken concerning it; and all the Gentiles shall turn truly to fear the Lord God, and shall
                           undermine (and destroy) their idols; and all the Gentiles shall bless the Lord," &amp;c., ver. 9. (Haydock) --- This text
                           is of importance, as it specifies the name of Jonas, and is quoted by St. Jerome; (ibid.) though Nahum (iii. 8.) and Sophonias
                           (ii. 13.) also foretold the destruction of Ninive. It speaks of the future, and not of the past ruin, of the temple, which
                           certainly took place after the death of Tobias. (Calmet) --- The prophets, however, frequently speak of future events, as
                           if they were past, to shew the certainty of their predictions. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           Jonas, spoke, shall surely be accomplished." (Haydock) --- This prediction was conditional, as was also the pardon of the
                           people, who were justly punished for their relapse. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           decency, and thy mother with me, and tarry <i>then</i> no longer at Ninive. Son, behold what Aman (Syriac, Acab.) did to Achiachar,
                           who fed him, how he conducted him from light into darkness, and what return he made him. Now, Achiachar met with safety: but
                           he received his due, and he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and was rescued from the snare of death, which was
                           laid for him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished. And now, son, behold the effects of alms-deeds, and how justice
                           brings deliverance. While he was speaking these things, his soul failed upon the bed: but he was 150 years old, and he buried
                           him honourably." (Haydock) --- The allusion to Aman seems improper, he lived many years after the captivity; (Calmet) or rather
                           it may refer to some other history (Houbigant) with which we are not acquainted. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           his death, of the destruction of Ninive, <i>the citizens of</i> which Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus led captives; and he rejoiced
                           over Ninive before he died." We have been more particular in giving the Greek text of this book, because some look upon it
                           as an original; and we should wish to lose no particle of the word of God, which is more precious than gold. Tobias might
                           applaud the execution of divine justice without any private resentment. (Haydock) --- Ninive was taken by Nabuchodonosor,
                           who acted for his father, Nabopolassar, with whom Astyages, king of the Medes, was leagued. They took the city in the reign
                           of Chinaladan, or Sarac, in the year of the world 3378. It also fell a prey to its enemies, under Sardanapalus, in the year
                           3257; as the inhabitants did not persevere in sentiments of repentance, which they had entertained at the preaching of Jonas,
                           in the reign of Phul. Hence God revealed its destruction to Tobias. (Calmet) --- <i>With joy,</i> may refer to the surviving
                           friends, who rejoiced interiorly at his felicity, while they wept for their own loss; or it may he understood of the deceased;
                           who, like his father, (ver. 4.; Calmet) rejoiced in the Lord, and in performance of good works.</font></p><b>

                           and imitation. They thought and acted in perfect conformity with the gospel. The father might represent the old law, under
