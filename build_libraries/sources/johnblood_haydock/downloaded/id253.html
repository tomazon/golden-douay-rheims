                           of the laws is the justification of man; see particularly in the 118th Psalm, the legal rites justified in regard to the outward

                           to be moved from place to place with the Israelites, which they kept afterwards, and had a resemblance of it in the temple.
                           This tabernacle consisted of two parts, which St. Paul here calls the first and second. The first part was called the <I>holy,</I>
                           which was separated from the rest of the temple by a <I>veil.</I> In this first part were the <I>candlesticks,</I> i.e. one
                           candlestick, as it is called, Exodus xxv. 37., having seven branches in which were placed lamps; and a <I>table,</I> on which
                           were placed twelve loaves, according to the number of the Jewish tribes, to be changed every week. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           The first veil was at the entrance of the holy place, and separated it from the outward court; the second veil separated the

                           the golden censer.</I> What is meant by this is uncertain, no mention being made of a golden censer in either part of the
                           tabernacle made by the order of Moses, which the apostle here speaks of. Some say that the high priest, when he entered once
                           a year into the holy of holies, made use of a golden censer, which he left there: but this is merely a conjecture. Others
                           think that by the golden censer is meant the altar of perfumes, or where perfumes were burnt, which was, as it were a large
                           censer, and is called by the same Greek word by Josephus, the historian; but then there occurs this difficulty, that this
                           altar was in that first part called the holy, not in the holy of holies, to which the same interpreters answer, that this
                           altar was placed just at the entrance into the holy of holies, and so may be looked upon as belonging to the holy of holies:
                           not does the text say it was in the holy of holies, but only <I>having,</I> &amp;c. as a town may be said to have fortifications
                           which are not within the town itself. --- <I>And the tables of the testament,</I> or covenant. The ark was certainly in the
                           holy of holies, in which[2] was the golden urn, with a measure of manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the
                           testament, or the tables of stone, on which were engraven the ten commandments. Nothing but these tables were within the ark:
                           (see 3 Kings viii. and 2 Paralipomenon v. 10.) so that when it is said, <I>in which was the golden urn and the rod of Aaron,</I>
                           the meaning seems to be, that they were indeed in the holy of holies with the ark, but not within the ark. (Witham) --- In
                           the Greek it is easy to confound the word&nbsp;<I><U>thusiasterion</U>,</I> which signifies altar, with&nbsp;<I><U>thumiaterion</U>,</I>
                           which means censer. It was placed adjoining the inward veil, so that the clouds of the incense filled the holy of holies;
                           and hence it is mentioned by St. Paul as contained therein. --- The apostle describes these things as they were in the tabernacle
                           which Moses constructed in the desert. (Bible de Vence) --- We see with what great and continued respect and veneration the
                           manna and Aaron's rod, &amp;c. were kept by the Jews, and shall not Christians be allowed to preserve with equal respect the
                           monuments of God's mercies, and tokens of Christ's passion? See St. Cyril, (lib. iv. contra Julianum) where he defends against
                           the apostate, the keeping and honouring the cross on which Christ died. See also in St. Jerome (ep. xvii. chap. 5.) and in
                           St. Paulinus, (ep. 11.) what reverence the faithful in those early periods of the Church paid to the sepulchres of Christ
                           and his martyrs, as also to their relics. "We reverence and worship[honour]," says the latter, "the sepulchres of the martyrs;
                           and, if we can, we apply the holy ashes to our eyes and mouth."</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>overshadowing the propitiatory,</I> or seat of mercy, which was all of gold, of the same size as the ark, and like a cover
                           to it. Just over this propitiatory were placed the two cherubs, spreading their wings looking towards one another, and upon
                           the propitiatory. See Exodus xxxvi. and xxxvii. From this place God made known his presence, and the effects of his mercy
                           to the people. Here he was said to be seated on the cherubims, and that the ark was his footstool. Psalm xcviii., <I>Adore
                           his footstool;</I> i.e. prostrate before his ark. These two images of cherubs, shew that God did not absolutely forbid images
                           at that time, when the people were so addicted to idolatry, but only to adore them. (Witham) --- How futile is it to object
                           from the commandment that it is forbidden to use holy images in the Church, when we here behold even amongst the people most
                           prone to idolatry, most gross in their ideas of spiritual things, and to whom the precept was specially given not to make
                           any graven <I>idols,</I> the same God commanding these images of angels to be made and set in the most holy place of the tabernacle

                           as were called unclean, or made them unclean. See Leviticus x. 9., where the priests are forbidden to drink wine when they

                           the new law. Those imperfect carnal sacrifices could only make the priests and the people reputed clean, so that they were
                           no longer to be treated as transgressors, and liable to punishments, prescribed and inflicted by the law: but the sacrifice
                           of Christ has made our consciences interiorly clean, and sanctified them even in the sight of God. Having offered himself
                           unspotted to God by the Holy Ghost, the divine Spirit of the Holy Ghost moving Christ as man to make this oblation of himself,
                           though free from all sin, and incapable of sinning. And being this oblation, made by him, who was God as well as man, it was
                           an oblation of infinite value, which repaired the injury done to God by sin, and redeemed mankind from the slavery of sin.

                           priest, and who is the victim; we see the virtue and efficacy of this sacrifice, and why it was offered; also by what signs
                           we may know whether we partake of it, viz. if dying to sin and to the world, we live to God, and serve him in spirit and truth.
                           Calvin makes Jesus Christ a priest and mediator, according to his <I>divinity;</I> but in that case Christ would be inferior
                           to his Father, not only as man, but according to his divinity: for the priest is inferior to the God to whom he offers sacrifice,
                           which is an expression of supreme excellence. See Dr. Kellison's survey of the Protestant religion.</FONT></P><B>

                           the mediator, and which were confirmed by his blood and by his death, but also to the former alliance and promises or blessings
                           God made to the Israelites, when he chose them to be his elect people, and gave them his law and his commandments under Moses.
                           It is true God is immortal in his own nature, cannot die, and therefore cannot make a testament that shall be confirmed by
                           his own death. But as for the new alliance, or New Testament, as here it must be called, it was confirmed by the death of
                           the Son of God; that is, of God made man, by which it is true to say that God died for us, though he did not die, nor could
                           die, as God. And as for the former alliance, or <I>first testament,</I> as it is called here, (ver. 18.) that, says St. Paul,
                           (which was only a figure of the <I>second</I> or <I>new testament</I>) was not made nor ratified <I>without the blood</I>

                           by the blood of Jesus Christ. The flowing, therefore, of the pure water and blood from the wound in Christ's side, denoted
                           that the real expiation was now complete, and the cleansing font set open; and on this account, they are appealed to by St.
                           John, as two of the three terrestrial witnesses, whose testimony is so efficacious for the confirmation of our faith, that
                           the crucified Jesus was the Christ foretold by the prophets. [John xix. 34; 1 John v. 6, 8.] And thus "the old law confirms

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 For Jesus hath not entered into the holies made with hands, the patterns
                                    of the true: but into heaven itself, that he may appear now in the presence of God for us:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth
                                    into the holies every year with the blood of others:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the
                                    world: but now once at the end of ages, he hath appeared for the destruction of sin, by the sacrifice of himself.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And as it is appointed for men once to die, and after this the judgment:</font></p>
