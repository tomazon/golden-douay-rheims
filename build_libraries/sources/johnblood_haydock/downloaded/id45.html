                           <I>When the morning was come.</I> The evangelist is silent with regard to what was transacted during the night, and of the
                           multiplied cruelties and base indignities offered to our divine Redeemer during the whole of the night; for, after he has
                           informed us of Peter's denial, he immediately proceeds to tell us what happened at break of day. (St. Augustine) --- The chief
                           priests, with the ancients and scribes, after they had wreaked their vengeance upon Jesus by the vilest treatment of his sacred
                           person, took counsel how they might induce the governor to put him to death. In this Sanhedrim, or full council of seventy-two,
                           they again put the question to hold a council. --- <I>Council.</I> Caiphas, in the morning, called a full council of the Sanhedrim.
                           They again put the question to Jesus, and commanded him to tell them if he were <I>the Christ,</I> and <I>the Son of God?</I>
                           He owned he was. (Luke xxii. 70.) --- Upon this they led him away, and <I>delivered him to Pontius Pilate, the governor:</I>
                           literally, <I>the president.</I> This they did, 1. because being a festival day, they apprehended a tumult among the people.
                           2. To make him die a more infamous death on the cross; otherwise they might perhaps have stoned him to death, as they afterwards
                           did St. Stephen. 3. The power of death being taken from them, they durst not well exercise it, at least, without permission
                           from the Roman governor. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           as one certainly guilty of death, they conduct him to Pilate. All attend to repress by their authority the people, to engage
                           Pilate to pronounce sooner the sentence, when he saw that he was condemned by the unanimous voice of the Sanhedrim, and to
                           hinder any one from rising in his defence. They were the more anxious, 1. because about three years before, the power of life
                           and death had been taken from them; 2. because they wished to throw the odium of the crime on another person; and lastly,
                           because as both Jew and Gentile were equally to benefit of Christ's death, so both Jew and Gentile were to concur in inflicting
                           it; and as all were to have salvation offered them through his blood, so none were to be freed from the guilt of shedding
                           it. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Judas, ... repenting himself.</I> A fruitless repentance, accompanied with a new sin of despair, says St. Leo. (Witham) ---
                           Perceiving that Jesus was delivered up, and remembering what our divine Saviour had said concerning his resurrection, he repented
                           of his atrocious wickedness. Perhaps Satan, who assisted and urged him on to betray his Master, deserted him, not that he
                           had prevailed upon the unhappy miscreant to perpetrate what he had so passionately desired. But how could Judas see that Jesus
                           was condemned? He certainly did not see it, but foreboded in his despairing mind what would be the event. But some are of
                           opinion that this passage is referred to Judas himself, who then became sensible of his crime, and saw his condemnation impending
                           over his head. (Origen) --- For the devil does not blind his agents in such a manner, as to leave them insensible of the crime
                           they are about to commit, till it is perpetrated. (St. Chrysostom) --- Although Judas conceived a horror at his crime, and
                           confessed it, and made satisfaction to a certain degree by restoring the money, still many essential conditions were wanting
                           to his repentance: 1. faith in Christ, as God, as a redeemer, as the sole justifier from sin; 2. besides this, there was also
                           wanting hopes of pardon, as in Cain, and a love of a much injured and much offended God. Hence his grief was unavailing, like
                           that of the damned. If Judas, says an ancient Father, had had recourse to sincere repentance, and not to the halter, there
                           was mercy in store even for the traitor. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           to Achitophel's death. (Witham) --- To his first repentance succeeded fell despair, which the devil pursued to his eternal
                           destruction. If the unhappy man had sought true repentance, and observed due moderation in it, (by avoiding both extremes,
                           presumption and despair) he might have heard a forgiving Master speaking to him these consoling words: <I>I will not the death

                           whereas the passage is found in Zacharias xi. 12. Some judge it to have been in some writing of Jeremias, now lost; as St.
                           Jerome says he found it in a writing of Jeremias, which was not canonical. Others conjecture, that Zacharias had also the

                           stood before the governor.</I> By comparing the four evangelists together Pilate condescended to come out to the priests,
                           and asked them, what accusations they brought against this man? They replied first in general terms: (John xviii. 30.) <I>If
                           he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee. Take him you,</I> said Pilate, <I>and judge him according
                           to your law.</I> They answered: It is not permitted us to put any one to death. After this they accused him of <I>raising
                           tumults, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar;</I> (Luke xxiii. 2; a manifest falsehood; see Matthew xxii,) and that he
                           said, he <I>is Christ, the king.</I> Upon this Pilate called him into the palace before him, and said: <I>Art thou the king
                           of the Jews?</I> Jesus <I>owned he was:</I> but first asked Pilate, if he said this of himself, or by the suggestion of others;
                           which was to insinuate, that this information of his being a king came from his malicious adversaries; and that Pilate, having
                           been so long governor, could not but know that he had never set himself up for king, nor pretended to any kingly power. However,
                           Pilate replied somewhat peevishly: <I>Am I a Jew? Thy own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee up to me: what
                           hast thou done?</I> Jesus then told Pilate, that <I>his kingdom was not of this world.</I> This abundantly satisfied Pilate:
                           who needed not trouble his head about any spiritual kingdom, or such as was not of this world. Jesus speaking of <I>truth,</I>
                           Pilate asked him after a slight manner, <I>what is truth?</I> but perhaps, without waiting for any answer, went presently
                           out, and told the Jews, that he found <I>no cause</I> nor crime <I>in Jesus.</I> (Witham) --- The Judge of every living creature
                           was arraigned by permission of his heavenly Father, before the petty judge of Judea, and suffers himself to be interrogated
                           by him, though every question proposed was either put out of ridicule, or some equally base motive. (Origen) --- Our divine
                           Saviour confessed himself to be a king; but that he might give no umbrage either to Jew or Gentile, he at the same time declared,
                           that his kingdom was not of this world. (St. Chrysostom)</FONT></P><B>

                           Herod Antipas, who was tetrarch of Galilee; and being a Jew was come up to Jerusalem at this great feast. Herod was glad to
                           see Jesus brought to him, hoping to see him do some miracle in his presence: but finding him silent, and that he did not satisfy
                           his curiosity, <I>he contemned him,</I> and ordered him to be clothed in such a garment as might make him laughed at for a
                           fool, or a mock king; and in this dress, sent him back through the streets to Pilate. (Witham) --- The president admires the
                           constancy and courage of his soul; and though, perhaps, he saw it was necessary to declare him guilty of the accusation; yet,
                           beholding the heavenly wisdom and gravity that appeared in his countenance and the heavenly composure in which he stood, he
                           could not conceal his admiration at his conduct. So that it seemed to him most miraculous, that a man brought to the bar,
                           and tried for a capital crime, should stand without fear at the approach of death, which men commonly so much dread. (Origen)</FONT></P><B>

                           ... of the two,</I> said Pilate to them, will you have released? St. Mark tells us, that at the instigation of the priests,
                           the people petitioned for <I>Barabbas.</I> It was no small disappointment to Pilate. <I>What then,</I> said he, <I>shall I
                           do with Jesus?</I> They all answer, <I>let him be crucified.</I> In St. Luke, <I>crucify him, crucify him. What evil hath
                           he done? </I>replied Pilate; and this he repeated <I>thrice,</I> according to St. Luke, xxiii. 22. --- Here in order followed
                           the cruel scourging of our blessed Saviour, which Pilate consented to, in hopes to move the people to compassion. This was
                           executed with the utmost cruelty. For they assembled the whole band of soldiers, commonly about 600. And they made him one
                           <I>wound from head to foot.</I> Then a <I>scarlet or purple</I> coat was thrown over his shoulders: and <I>platting or wreathing
                           a crown of thorns,</I> i.e. twisting sharp thorns, with some resemblance of a crown, they violently pressed it down on his
                           head; and struck him at their pleasure with <I>a reed,</I> or <I>cane,</I> which they had placed in his hand, instead of a
                           sceptre; and kneeling in derision, said, <I>Hail, king of the Jews.</I> --- When the soldiers had treated Jesus in this barbarous
                           manner, Pilate himself presented him in this condition to the people saying, <I>Behold the man.</I> He imagined their fury
                           would now be changed into pity: but they still cried out, <I>Crucify him! crucify him!</I> Take him you, said Pilate, and
                           crucify him; for I find no crime in him. The Jews then answered: <I>We have a law: and according to our law, he must die;
                           because he hath made himself the Son of God.</I> At this Pilate was more afraid, lest perhaps he should be of the progeny
                           of the gods, as the Romans fancied their heroes to be. He returned back to the palace and asked Jesus again: <I>whence art
                           thou?</I> Jesus gave him no direct answer, yet told him, <I>he could have not power over him, unless it had been granted him
                           from above.</I> Pilate was still very desirous to set him at liberty, especially when his wife sent a message to him to have
                           nothing to do with that just man, for that she had suffered much in a dream on his account. (Matthew xxvii. 19.) --- The Jews
                           perceived Pilate's great inclination to set Jesus at liberty: they therefore tell him in plain terms, <I>that if he doth dismiss
                           this </I>man,<I> he is no friend to Cæsar: </I>for <I>every one,</I> say they,<I> that pretends to be a king, contradicts
                           Cæsar.</I> This moved Pilate more than any thing whatsoever, and prevailed with him both against justice and his own conscience,
                           to condemn Jesus. He feared lest some private information might be presented against him to Tiberius Cæsar. He presently mounted
                           the judgment-seat in a public place, and said to the Jews: <I>behold your king.</I> They cry out, <I>away with him, crucify
                           him. Shall I crucify your king?</I> said Pilate. They reply: <I>we have no king but Cæsar;</I> thus renouncing their Messias.
                           At this Pilate yielded; and (ver. 24,) <I>washed his hands,</I> and said: <I>I am innocent of the blood of this just man:

                           was the capital of a province in Africa, near Lybia. See Acts ii. 10. Some are of opinion that this Simon was a Jew; his name
                           favours that sentiment, and there were many Jews in that province. (Bible de Vence) --- St. John says that Christ went out
                           carrying his own cross, while the other three evangelists state that they forced Simon of Cyrene to carry it for him. Both
                           are true: for seeing Christ unequal to the weight, they compelled the other to take it up for him; not a part only, as some
                           painters represent, but the whole, to Mount Calvary, as Jesus Christ had carried the whole before. (St. Augustine) --- The
                           evangelists would not have been so particular in this part, had they not wished to inculcate, that all who desire to follow
                           Christ, must also take up their cross and follow him. (St. Jerome and Jansenius) --- The latter says, in his Commentaries
                           on the Gospels; as no one liked to carry the ignominious cross, the insolence of the soldiery compelled a stranger to carry
                           it. By this we learn, that the cross is not taken up by many except with compulsion; but, when once taken up, they carry it
                           with willingness. (Jansenius)</FONT></P><B>

                           hour lasted till the sixth hour; and so St. Mark calls it the third hour, because the third great hour (which contained three
                           lesser hours) did not end till mid-day, when the sixth hour was beginning; so that the end of the third, and the beginning

                           of the world where, of course, it should have been light, is doubted. Origen thinks this darkness was only in Palestine, and
                           the neighbouring countries: for as to the words, over <I>the whole earth,</I> or over <I>the whole land,</I> we find one kingdom
                           or empire, by a common way of speaking, called the <I>whole earth,</I> or the <I>whole world.</I> Here, in the history of
                           Christ's passion, we should take notice of his seven last words, or sentences on the cross. 1. He prayed for his enemies,
                           and those that put him to death, (Luke xxiii. 34.) <I>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</I> 2. His mercy
                           called the good thief, <I>This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise,</I> Luke xxiii. 43. 3. He recommended his beloved disciple
                           to his mother, saying: <I>woman, behold thy son;</I> and his mother to the same disciple, with, <I>Behold thy mother.</I>
                           (John xix. 26. and 27.) 4. Here (ver. 46) he cried out with a loud voice, <I>Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani,</I> i.e. <I>my God,
                           my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</I> These words, out of Psalm xxi. 1[2?], were to express his violent sufferings. The Arians
                           objected them against the divinity of Christ; to whom the Fathers answer, that he spoke these words in the person of sinners,
                           for whose sake he suffered, as they shew by the following words of the same Psalm: <I>far from my salvation are the words
                           of my sins:</I> which cannot be applied to Christ, he being incapable of sinning. Besides, these words may be expounded as
                           a prayer, by which he desires of his Father, not to be abandoned any longer, but that his sufferings may now have an end.
                           In fine, that these words were uttered with an entire confidence, and an assurance in the presence and assistance of God,
                           appears by what he presently added, recommending his spirit into the hands of his Father. The fifth sentence was, <I>I thirst,</I>
                           to let us know the violent thirst of his exhausted body. St. John (xix. 28,) says it was that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
                           (Psalm lxviii. 22.) <I>And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</I> The sixth sentence was, <I>It is consummated;</I>
                           (John xix. 30) i.e. the work of man's redemption, and all the prophecies, and decrees of heaven, concerning me, the Saviour
                           of the world, are now accomplished. The seventh and last sentence was, <I>Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit;</I>
                           and with these words, says St. Luke, (xxiii. 46.) pronounced with <I>a loud voice, he expired.</I> (Witham) --- The learned
                           are divided on this passage: 1st, As to the cause of the obscuration of the sun; and, 2ndly, as to the extent of its darkness.
                           Origen is inclined to think that the darkness was partial, and confined to Judea and the neighbouring countries, as the darkness
                           of Egypt was only perceived in that country, and not in Gessen, where the children of Israel were. St. Jerome imagines that
                           the obscurity was caused by the rays of the sun being suddenly withdrawn by divine power, as was the case in Egypt. These
                           they give as conjectures only. But St. Dionysius, the Areopagite, speaks from his own observations, being, as he informs us
                           in a letter to St. Polycarp, then at Heliopolis, a city of Egypt, for the purpose of astronomical observations. He noticed
                           this miraculous eclipse. He saw the moon rise from the east, and placing itself directly under the sun, cause the above mentioned
                           darkness. This made him cry out to his companion, in the greatest admiration. He observes in this eclipse, four things contrary
                           to the ordinary course of nature: 1. The time, full moon, when there cannot be an eclipse of the sun; 2. the moon being under
                           the sun at the sixth hour, returned to its place in the east for the evening; 3. the order in which the sun was obscured.
                           In ordinary eclipses, the western limb of the sun is first obscured, on account of the motion of the moon in its orbit, being
                           from west to east; whereas, in the present case, the moon having already passed the sun, and being removed from the sun the
                           distance of a semicircle, returned from the east to the sun, and of course first eclipsed it on the eastern limb: 4. contrary
                           to the manner of common eclipses, in which that part is first visible which was first obscured, that part of the sun first
                           appeared which was last eclipsed, because the moon returned again to the east after the eclipse was full. To this may be added
                           the observation of St. Chrysostom and St. Jerome: that the duration of natural eclipses is very short, whilst this lasted
                           the space of three whole hours. But this interposition of the moon, which suffers the greatest parallax, could not cause an
                           universal eclipse; if, therefore, the text is to be understood literally of the whole earth, another cause must be supposed
                           for this universal darkness. But it may be understood in a more limited sense, of the land of Judea. (Denis the Carthusian)</FONT></P><B>

                           he called Elias to his aid. (St. Jerome) --- The soldiers thinking that he called for Elias, wished to hinder any one from
                           offering vinegar, lest it should hasten his death, and prevent Elias from coming to assist him; which, from the darkness and
                           other signs, they might think probable. (St. Augustine) --- Wine and vinegar, on account of their penetrating quality, were
                           thought to hasten death. We read in Plutarch, that wine was given to Mark Anthony, when he had stabbed himself, that he might

                           veil. And into this holy of holies, no one was to enter except the high priest, and he but once a-year. Both these veils seem
                           to have been rent at Christ's death: and by their being broken down, was signified first, that the ceremonies of the ancient

                           high priest on this occasion, was probably the apprehension lest this prediction of Christ's resurrection should be verified.
                           The wonderful prodigies which took place at his death, and especially the opening of the graves, (though none arose it is
                           believed till after Christ's resurrection, since Christ is called the first-born from the dead, 1 Colossians i. 18. and the
                           first-fruits of them that sleep, 1 Corinthians xv. 20.) might naturally appear as preludes to what he had so often foretold.
                           It is true they had no idea but of a temporal passing resurrection , like that of Lazarus, which they had seen: yet they judged
                           that such an event might be attended with the most serious consequences. Hence, it is probable, that they gave them most express
                           injunctions to put Jesus to death by all means, and to secure the body in the monument: for, it is certain, they formed a
                           similar design against the life of Lazarus, whose resurrection occasioned many to believe in Jesus. (Haydock) --- They were
                           not satisfied with taking his life; they must, moreover, deprived him of his good name. (Menochius) ---The chief priests could
                           not yet be satisfied, after the horrid murder they had committed, unless they stirred up the minds of the people to a still
                           greater height, by calumniating this innocent Lamb of God, and calling <I>him</I> an impostor, who was the most innocent of
                           men, and spread abroad their poisonous doctrines in every sentence they uttered. (St. Jerome)</FONT></P><B>

                           Christ our Lord was infallibly risen; and to remove every, the least possibility of deceit, Pilate would not permit the soldiers
                           alone to seal up the monument. (St. Thomas Aquinas) --- The high priests made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone at the
