                           <i>The law having a shadow</i>[1]<i> of the good things to come.</i> The apostle continues till the 19th verse to shew the
                           insufficiency of the former law, as to the redemption and salvation of mankind. By the <i>good things to come,</i> some understand
                           heaven itself, and the happiness of the elect there, of which the law was but a shadow, whereas we have a much more perfect
                           <i>image</i> and knowledge of heaven in the new law, than they who were under the former law. Others by <i>good things to
                           come,</i> understand the blessings of interior graces, with a remission of our sins in the sight of God, and true sanctification,
                           of which all the sacrifices and sacraments of the old law, without faith in Christ, were but a <i>shadow:</i> and now in the
                           new law we have an express image of them, i.e. we have these blessings themselves. (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Then they would have</i>[2] <i>ceased to be offered.</i> That is, if they could have made the worshippers perfect; to wit,
                           in such a manner as the one sacrifice of Christ, who was the Lamb of God that took away the sins of the world, by making a
                           full reparation to the divine justice for the sin of Adam, and of all his offspring. For we must take notice that he compares
                           the sacrifice of Christ, which wrought a general redemption, with the sacrifices of the former law, which could never make
                           any sufficient atonement to the majesty of God offended by sin, and which, by the decree of heaven, were to cease as soon
                           as Christ's sacrifice of a general redemption was made: for then the worshippers would be so cleansed from sin, that they
                           would stand in need of no more, but that the merits and satisfactions of Christ, their Redeemer, should be applied to them
                           according to the order of God's providence; that is, by faith in Christ, by his sacraments, by a true repentance, and the
                           practice of virtue and good works. (Witham) --- If they had been of themselves perfect to all the intents of redemption and
                           remission, as Christ's death is, there would have been no occasion of so often repeating them; as there is no occasion for
                           Christ's dying any more for our sins. (Challoner)</font></p><b>

                           size="3"> <i>The Holy Ghost also doth testify to us,</i> and assures us of this, by the prophet Jeremias, (Chap. xxxi. 33.)
                           in the words above cited, (Chap. viii. ver. 8.) when he promises to give a new testament, and that he will remember no more
                           their sins. --- <i>Now where</i> there is <i>remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin.</i> That is, there
                           is no need of any other oblation to redeem us from sin, after the price of our redemption from sin is paid. There is no need
                           of any other different oblation; all that is wanting, is the application of the merits and satisfactions of Christ. No need
                           of those sacrifices, which were ordered in the law of Moses. To convince them of this, is the main design of St. Paul in this
                           place. The pretended reformers, from several expressions of St. Paul in this chapter, think they have clear proofs that no
                           sacrifice at all ought to be offered after Christ's one sacrifice on the cross; and that so many sacrifices and oblations
                           of masses, are both needless and against the doctrine of the apostle, who says, that Christ by <i>one oblation hath perfected
                           for ever them that are sanctified.</i> (ver. 14.) And again, <i>that where there is a remission</i> of sins, now <i>there
                           is no more an oblation for sin.</i> This objection, which is obvious enough, was not first invented by the Calvinists against
                           them they nickname Papists: the same is found in the ancient Fathers; and by their answers, and what they have witnessed concerning
                           the daily sacrifice of the mass, they may find their doctrine of a religion without a continued sacrifice evidently against
                           the doctrine and practice of the Catholic Church from the first ages[centuries] of the Christian religion, till they came
                           to be reformers, not of manners, but of the Catholic belief. Hear St. Chrysostom (hom. xvii.) in his commentary on this very
                           chapter: "What then, saith he, do not we offer up (or make an oblation) every day? We offer up indeed, but with a remembrance
                           of his death. And this oblation is one, and not many. How is it one, and not many? ...because, as he that is offered many
                           times, and in many places, is the same body, not many and different bodies, so is it one sacrifice. He (Christ) is our high
                           priest, who offered this sacrifice, by which we are cleansed: we now offer up the same....He said: Do this in remembrance
                           of me. We do not offer a different sacrifice, but the very same, as then our high priest." St. Chrysostom here says, and repeats
                           it over and over again, that we offer up <i>a sacrifice.</i> 2. That we offer it up <i>every day.</i> 3. That the sacrifice
                           which we daily offer is <i>one and the same oblation,</i> one <i>and the same sacrifice,</i> which our high priest, Christ,
                           offered. 4. That in offering this sacrifice, which in <i>all places, and at all times,</i> is the same body of Christ, and
                           the same sacrifice, we do, and offer it, as he commanded us at his last supper, with a remembrance of him. Is this the practice,
                           and is this the doctrine of our dear countrymen, the English Protestants? But at least it is the constant doctrine, as well
                           as practice, of the whole Catholic Church. The council of Trent, as we have already cited the words, (chap. vii.) teacheth
                           the very same as St. Chrysostom who never says, as some one of late hath pretended, that what we offer is a <em>remembrance
                           only</em>.&nbsp; As the sacrament of the Eucharist, according to the words of Christ in the gospel, is to be taken with a
                           remembrance of him, and yet is not a <em>remembrance only,</em> but is his <i>body and blood,</i> so the sacrifice is to be
                           performed with a remembrance of his benefits and sufferings, by his priests and ministers, but at the same time is a true
                           and propitiatory sacrifice, the priests daily sacrifice, and offer up the same sacrifice, the manner only being different.
                           The sacrifice and mass offered by Peter, is not different in the notion of a sacrifice or oblation from that of Paul, though
                           the priests and their particular actions be different: the same sacrifice was offered by the apostles, and in all Christian
                           ages; and the same sacrifice, according to the prophecy of Malachias, (chap. i. ver. 11.) shall be offered in all nations
                           to the end of the world. This doctrine and practice is not only witnessed by St. Chrysostom but generally by the ancient Fathers
                           and interpreters, as we have taken notice in short in the annotations on St. Matthew. See St. Ignatius, in his epistle to
                           the people of Smyrna; St. Justin Martyr, in his dialogue with Tryphon; St. Irenæus, lib. 4. chap. xxxii. and xxxiv.; Tertullian,

                           the cross and <i>remission of sins,</i> obtained by our Saviour Christ, will our adversaries pretend insisting on the bare
                           letter, that Christ has done all for us, and that we need do nothing, unless perhaps endeavour to catch hold of the justifying
                           cloak of Christ's justice by faith only? At this rate the love of God and of our neighbour, a life of self-denials, such as
                           Christ preached to every one in the gospel, the practices of prayer, fastings, almsdeeds, and all good works, the sacraments
                           instituted by our Saviour Christ may be all safely laid aside; and we may conclude from hence, that all men's sins are remitted
                           before they are committed. Into what extravagances do men run, when their private spirit pretends to follow the letter of
                           the Holy Scriptures, and when they make their private judgment the supreme guide in matter of divine faith? It is very true,
                           that Christ hath paid the ransom of all our sins, and his satisfactions are infinite; but to partake of the benefit of this
                           general redemption, the merits and satisfaction of Christ are to be applied to our souls, and this by the order of Providence
                           is to be done not only by faith but by other virtues, by good works, by the sacraments, and by repeating the oblation and
                           the same sacrifice, the manner only being different, according to the doctrine and practice of the Catholic Church from the
                           apostle's time. (Witham) --- Where there is a full remission of sins, as in baptism, there is no more occasion for a <i>sin-offering</i>
                           to be made for such sins already remitted; and as for sins committed afterwards, they can only be remitted in virtue of the
                           one oblation of Christ's death. (Challoner)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Not forsaking our assembly.</i>[6] St. Chrysostom understands the assemblies of Christians, where they met to celebrate
                           the divine mysteries. Others expound it of not leaving the faith and communion of the Catholic Church by turning apostates:
                           this is confirmed by the following words: <i>for if we sin wilfully,...there is now left no sacrifice for sins.</i> The Novatian
                           heretics understood no pardon for sins after baptism. St. Chrysostom and others understood no second baptism, wherewith to
                           be cleansed in the same manner as before; but the most probable interpretation, and most agreeable to the text and doctrine
                           of St. Paul, seems to be, that now remained no sacrifice for sins, i.e. no other sacrifice but that of Christ, which the apostate
                           renouncing, by quitting and abandoning his faith, thereby cuts himself off from the very groundwork and foundation of salvation,
                           as long as he continues in his apostacy. So that nothing remains for him but a dreadful expectation[7] of God's just and severe
                           judgments. (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           again, we cannot expect to have that abundant remission of sins, which Christ purchased by his death, applied to our souls
                           in that ample manner as it is in baptism; but we have rather all manner of reason to look for a dreadful judgment; the more,
                           because apostates from the know truth seldom or never have the grace to return to it. (Challoner)</font></p><b>

                           the law of Moses, to shew how much greater punishments Christians deserve when they are ungrateful to Christ after much greater
                           benefits, when they may be said to have <i>trodden under foot the Son of God</i> by despising him, who was the author of their
                           salvation, by shedding his blood upon the cross. (Witham) --- What is here said of the crime of apostacy, may in some measure
                           be applied to every deadly sin committed after baptism or the sacrament of penance; for a Christian by returning to sin, treads
                           under foot the Son of God, despises the adorable blood by which he was sanctified, and offers a henious[heinous?] affront
                           to the spirit of grace. Apostacy, though enormous, like all other sins can be forgiven by true repentance; but the apostle
                           declares, there is no victim for the guilt of a person who perseveres and dies in apostacy.</font></p><b>

                           that faith alone is sufficient for justification, and they define this faith to be <i>an assured confidence that their sins
                           are forgiven them wholly by Christ's passion.</i> No text, however, in Scripture teaches that a man is justified by faith
                           <i>only.</i> In Romans, (ii.) Luther makes St. Paul say that a man is justified by faith <i>only,</i> without the works of
                           the law: the authorized Protestant version has omitted the word <i>only,</i> foisted into the German translations. Solifidians
                           [Those who pretend justification by faith alone] vainly cite this text, as its obvious meaning is, that neither the works
                           of the <i>written</i> law, done by the Jew, nor the works of the law of <i>nature,</i> done by the Gentile, before either
                           of them believe in Christ, can without faith in Christ justify any one. Saving faith is a faith working through charity in
                           Jesus Christ, a faith which includes hope, love, repentance, and the use of the sacraments. Hence St. James (Chap. ii.) declares,
                           that a man may have faith but not works, but that faith without works will not save him. St. Paul teaches the same, 1 Corinthians
                           xiii. 2. "If I should have <i>all faith,</i> so as to move mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing;" where we should
                           observe the word <i>all</i> faith.</font></p><b>
