                           sunset on the foregoing day) so that the hours from sunset, at least, on the 14th day of the month of Nisan (at which time

                           said to have supped. (St. Augustine, tract. 55. in Joan.) --- He knew that he went out from God, and would return to God;
                           but at the same time, he did not leave God, when he went out from him, nor us, when he returns to him. (St. Augustine, as
                           above.) --- And though he went out from God, and returns to him, yet here he condescends to perform the office, not of the
                           Lord God of the universe, but of a man and a slave; (St. Augustine) and this, says St. Chrysostom, (hom. lxix. in Joan.) that

                           by the sacraments of baptism, or penance, from greater sins, must still endeavour to cleanse, and purify his affections from
                           lesser failings of human frailty. And you, my apostles, are clean from greater offences, <I>but not all of you,</I> meaning
                           the traitor Judas. (Witham) --- It is impossible that the extremities of the soul (if we may be allowed the expression) should
                           not, as long as we tread upon this earth, receive some stain or other; although in the opinion of men, the soul appear just.
                           Many indeed after baptism, are covered with the dust of sin, even to the head, but those who are disciples indeed, need only
                           to wash their feet. (Origen, tract. 32. in Joan.) --- The foulness of the feet, when the rest is clean, signifies the earthly
                           affections, and remains of former sins remitted, which are to be cleansed by devout acts of charity and humility. (St. Ambrose,
                           lib. iii. de Sacram. chap. 1; St. Bernard, de cæn. Dom. ser. 1.) --- Though his disciples were clean, still he washed their
                           feet, comformably to that of the Apocalypse, chap. xxii. "He that is clean, let him be cleansed still." (Origen, tract. 32.

                           prelates, and by Christian kings and princes. (Witham) --- He gives us an example of a more elevated act of virtue, that we
                           may at least learn to practise the lower degrees of it. For he indeed was their Lord, but when we perform this office, we
                           can but do it to our fellow-servants. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxx. in Joan.) --- This it is, blessed Peter, which you were ignorant

                           seem to express the manner that the Jews were placed at table. They had couches about a table, to lean or lie upon; and three
                           for example upon each couch. The master, or head of the company, was placed in the midst; so that we may suppose, that Christ
                           was placed on one of these couches in the midst, St. Peter on one side of him, and St. John on the other; and that St. John,
                           in that resting and leaning posture, had his head all the time turned, and inclined towards Christ's bosom: yet it can scarce
                           be imagined, that his head laid continually upon our Saviour's breast or bosom; for this posture would have been very uneasy
                           to Jesus, or to any one. St. John then leaned all supper time towards Jesus's bosom or breast, but not upon it. (Witham) ---
                           Whilst all were fearing for themselves, and Peter, the very head of the apostles, was trembling, St. John rests; reposing
                           on the bosom of Jesus. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxxi. in Joan.)</FONT></P><B>

                           ready, and desirous to suffer for our redemption. (Challoner) --- Christ does not by these words exhort the traitor, much
                           less command him, to perform his wicked deed; but he means to reprobate it, and at the same time testify that he would not
