                           <i>Two.</i> It is not easy to conceive why Josephus and Grotius place this expedition before the death of young Antiochus,
                           chap. xiii. 31, 41. Demetrius was become contemptible, and had a mine to regain his reputation by attacking the Parthians,
                           who had taken many provinces under the prudent conduct of Mithridates. The Greeks were impatient of this yoke. Many []ked[flocked?]
                           to Demetrius, and he gained several victories; but after two years, was perfidiously taken by a general of the Parthians while
                           treating of peace. Mithridates took him for a warning through the places which seemed favourable to him; but afterwards he
                           sent him into Hyrcania, gave him his daughter in marriage, with the badges of royalty, and promises of restoring him to his
                           kingdom. --- <i>Tryphon.</i> After the misfortune of Demetrius, he abandoned himself to his pleasures; and his adherents put
                           themselves under Cleopatra, the wife of his rival, who resided at Seleucia, upon the Orontes. (Usher, the year [of the world]
