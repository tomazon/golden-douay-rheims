                           The <I>families</I> consisted of the immediate descendants of the 12 patriarchs; the <I>houses</I> were the subdivisions of
                           these. The same plan of numbering the people was adopted on other occasions, Josue viii. 16., and 1 Kings x. 20. --- <I>Sex,</I>
                           between 20 and 60 years of age. All the subjects of the Eastern kings may be called upon, if they be able to bear arms; and
                           hence we find such immense armies in the Scripture, and in profane history. Moses numbered the people <I>once</I> before,
                           (Exodus xxx. 2,) and found exactly the same number of warriors, the dead being replaced by others, during the space of seven
                           months. Perhaps the odd numbers might not be specified, as all the totals consist of so many exact hundreds, except that of
                           the tribe of Gad, ver. 25. On the former occasion, the people were not perhaps ranged according to their tribes, which was
                           now deemed necessary, as the army was going to begin its march under its respective leaders. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>
