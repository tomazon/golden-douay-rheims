                                    Thus saith thy brother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and have been with him until this day:</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And Jacob said: O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac:
                                    O Lord who saidst to me, Return to thy land, and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for thee,</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 Thou didst say, that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 Two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And he sent them by the hands of his servants, every drove by itself,
                                    and he said to his servants: Go before me, and let there be a space between drove and drove.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my brother Esau,
                                    and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are these before thee?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob's: he hath sent them as a present
                                    to my lord Esau; and he cometh after us.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 In like manner he commanded the second, and the third, and all that
                                    followed with the droves, saying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when ye find him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And ye shall add: Thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us;
                                    for he said: I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious
                                    to me.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 So the presents went before him, but himself lodged that night in
                                    the camp.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And rising early, he took his two wives and his two handmaids, with
                                    his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Jaboc.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And when all things were brought over that belonged to him,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 He remained alone; and behold, a man wrestled with him till morning.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And when he saw that he could not overcome him, he touched the sinew
                                    of his thigh, and forthwith it shrank.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And he said to him: Let me go, for it is break of day. He answered:
                                    I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And he said: What is thy name? He answered: Jacob.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 But he said: Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but Israel; for if
                                    thou hast been strong against God, how much more shalt thou prevail against men?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 Jacob asked him: Tell me by what name art thou called? He answered:
                                    Why dost thou ask my name? And he blessed him in the same place.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel, saying: I have seen
                                    God face to face, and my soul has been saved.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he was past Phanuel;
                                    but he halted on his foot.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 Therefore the children of Israel, unto this day, eat not the sinew,
                                    that shrank in Jacob's thigh: because he touched the sinew of his thigh and it shrank.</font></p>
