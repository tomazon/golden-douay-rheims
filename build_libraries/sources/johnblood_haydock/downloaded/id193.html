                           The apostle begins by asserting his apostleship which the false teachers had called in question. He was called to it by Christ
                           himself, in his miraculous conversion, being changed "into a vessel of election to carry his name before kings and nations,
                           and the children of Israel." Thus chosen, we see him immediately after his conversion, preaching in Damascus and Arabia. (Calmet)
                           --- Let us beware of self-appointed teachers, who are neither called by God nor rightly ordained by men, and yet are observed
                           to intrude themselves into the ministry. --- <I>Not from man, neither by man.</I>[1] The apostle here expressly says, all
                           the brethren who are with me; to shew that he advanced nothing which was not conformable to the belief of all the faithful.
                           (St. Jerome) --- And again he says, (ver. 12.) <I>neither did I receive it from man, nor did I learn it, but by the revelation
                           of Jesus Christ.</I> That is, not from him, who was a man only, but from Jesus Christ, who was both God and man. St. Jerome,
                           who has left us a commentary on this epistle, (tom. iv. p. 222. Ed. Ben. as also St. Chrysostom, tom. iii. p. 709. Ed. Sav.)
                           takes notice, that Christ's divinity is proved from these expressions, that St. Paul was not an apostle, nor had his mission
                           from man only, but from Jesus Christ, who therefore was not a man only. --- <I>By Jesus Christ and God the Father.</I> A second
                           argument to shew the equality of the Son with the Father. And thirdly, it destroys another objection of the Arians, who used
                           to pretend that the Father, being always first named, he only, and not the Son, was properly God. Fourthly, another of their
                           arguments to prove only the Father truly God, was that he was called <I>the God,</I> with the Greek article; and here the
                           Father is called God, without the said Greek article. Fifthly, they also pretended that the Son was not God, because the Father
                           was said to deliver him to death: and here (ver. 3.) the Son is said <I>to give</I> and <I>deliver</I> himself. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           was about three or four years after their conversion. The apostle knowing very well how to suit his discourse to his auditors,
                           in this epistle makes use of a more severe and harsh address than is observable in his other epistles. The reason is, the
                           Galatians were a less civilized people, and had already shewn the little attachment they had to their spiritual father. (Calmet)
                           --- <I>To another gospel: which is not</I>[2] <I>another.</I> That is, it is not properly another, because they pretended
                           to be Christians, and teach the faith: and yet it was in some measure <I>another,</I> because <I>changed</I> by such teachers
                           with a mixture of errors, particularly that all converted Gentiles were to observe the Jewish law: and in this sense, they
                           are said <I>to subvert,</I> or destroy <I>the gospel of Christ:</I> so that the apostle hesitates not to pronounce and repeat
                           <I>an anathema, a curse</I> upon all that preach any thing <I>besides,</I> that is, in point of religion, not agreeing with
                           what he had taught. I cannot omit here a reflection, which St. Chrysostom makes on the 7th verse.<I> Where are they,</I> saith
                           he, <I>who condemn us</I> (Catholics) <I>for the differences</I> we have with heretics? and <I>who pretend there is no </I>such
                           essential <I>difference betwixt us and them,</I> so as to judge them excluded from the communion of the Catholic Church, out
                           of which there is no salvation, unless perhaps through ignorance. --- <I>Let them hear what St. Paul says, that they destroyed
                           the gospel who made any such innovations:</I> to wit, by introducing again as necessary some of the Jewish ceremonies, even
                           at a time when the Christians, who had been Jews, might lawfully use them, and even they who had been Gentiles. St. Paul says,
                           this is to <I>change</I> and <I>destroy</I> the gospel; he repeats <I>anathema</I> against them. Let them hear, and take notice
                           of this, who pretend that the unity of the one Catholic faith is sufficiently maintained by all Christian societies, that
                           agreeing, as they say, in fundamentals, their faith is a saving faith: that the council of Trent, without reason, pronounced
                           such anathemas against them: that all Catholics are uncharitable for denying them to be in the way to salvation, when they
                           make Scripture alone, as interpreted by their private judgment, the only rule of their faith. They may as well accuse not
                           only St. Chrysostom but also St. Paul, of <I>uncharitableness,</I> &amp;c. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>
