                           <i>Judgment.</i> Samuel was not to blame, and hence he was not punished like Heli. (Menochius) --- However, the misconduct
                           of the children of these two judges, in succession, (Haydock) gave occasion to the people to demand a king, who might not
                           be tempted by bribes. (Worthington) --- It is surprising that most of the great men who are mentioned in history, had degenerate
                           children. (Calmet) --- Such were some of David's sons, as well as Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, &amp;c. (Haydock) --- Was it
                           because their fathers were too much taken up with the affairs of state, to watch over the education of their children? or
                           rather, because these young men confided too much on the merits of their family, and took no pains to tread in the footsteps
                           of their parents? (Calmet) --- "We have here, says Josephus, a manifest proof that children do not always resemble their parents,
                           but sometimes good men spring from the wicked; and on the contrary, the virtuous have an evil progeny."</font></p><b>

                           <i>Judge us,</i> in a different manner from what had been hitherto done. (Haydock) --- By a crying ingratitude, they reject
                           the government of a wise old man, who had rendered them the most signal services. Perhaps the power of Naas, king of the Ammonites,
                           might afford them some pretext for acting as they did. (Calmet) --- <i>As all,</i> &amp;c. They seem to prefer the dominion
                           of kings, who ruled over the surrounding barbarous nations as they thought proper, (Haydock) before one who should be tied
                           down to observe the laws, prescribed by God, (Menochius) in case the Israelites should wish to have a king, Deuteronomy xvii.
                           (Haydock) --- In the East, monarchy was the most ancient form of government. (Tacitus, Hist. iv.; Just. i.) "Principio, imperium
                           penes Reges erat."</font></p><b>

                           <i>Samuel.</i> Nothing could be more disrespectful to him, nor more ungrateful to God, who had distinguished them from all
                           other nations, and had taken the government upon himself, and appointed the judges as his lieutenants. The foolish Israelites
                           wished to throw off this sweet yoke, and to be ruled in an arbitrary manner, like the infidels, as if God could not otherwise
                           protect them from their enemies. --- <i>Lord.</i> Josephus says that he passed the night without food or sleep, and the Lord
                           appeared to him. The will or petition "of the people, filled Samuel with great uneasiness, who on account of his innate justice,
                           did not like the regal power, as being too exorbitant. He rather approved of an aristocracy, as more conducive to the welfare
                           of the people." (Antiquities vi. 4.) He means such an aristocracy as the Israelites had been accustomed to, under the guidance
                           of men divinely commissioned, whence he elsewhere very properly styles it a <i>theocracy,</i> or "the government of God."

                           <i>Thee.</i> "God, in anger, grants a person what he desires wrongfully." (St. Augustine) --- He permits the people to follow
                           their own plans; and the Hebrews believe, that he gave them Saul to punish them, being well apprised of his proud and cruel
                           nature. (Cuneus Rep.) (Calmet) --- <i>Rejected,</i> &amp;c. The government of Israel hitherto had been a theocracy: in which
                           God himself immediately ruled, by laws which he had enacted, and by judges extraordinarily raised up by himself: and therefore
                           he complains that his people rejected him, in desiring a change of government, (Challoner) and wishing to appoint their own
                           magistrates. The priests and judges had been commissioned by God, Exodus xix., and Deuteronomy xvii. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           when he has the power in his hands. (Challoner) --- He intimates that the kings will frequently act in a tyrannical manner,
                           ver. 11. (Menochius) --- But the holy Fathers observe, that herein they do what is unjust, and contrary to God's law. St.
                           Gregory remarks, that Achab is punished for taking the vineyard of Naboth, (3 Kings xxi.) while David will not take a piece
                           of ground belonging to Ornan, even for an altar, without first paying a just price for it, 1 Paralipomenon xxi. 25. Some of
                           these <i>rights</i> or customs are prohibited to the <i>king,</i> Deuteronomy xvii. 16. It is true, kings enjoy great prerogatives
                           above judges, but never contrary to the law. They cannot take their subjects' goods: but the latter are bound to contribute
                           to the maintenance of government; and, if they refuse, may be compelled. If kings should be guilty of excesses, "yet them
                           are not to be deposed by the people,....but must be tolerated with patience, peace, and meekness, till God, by his sovereign
                           authority, left in his Church, dispose of them, which his divine wisdom and goodness often deferred to do, as here he expressly
                           forewarneth, (ver. 18) because he will punish the sins of the people by suffering evil princes to reign," Job xxxiv. 30. (Conc.
                           Later. c. iii. de h&#339;ret.[Fourth Lateran Council, constitution iii., On Heretics?]) (Worthington) See St. Thomas Aquinas,
                           2. 2. q. 12. a. 2. --- We may here also remark, that the people petitioned for a king, yet God made the choice; and, when
                           he proved rebellious, selected another by the hand of Samuel, though he permitted the former to enjoy his dignity till death,
                           chap. xiii., and xxxi. (Haydock) --- Grotius (Jur. i. 1., and 4.) maintains that Samuel here proposes the just rights of the
                           king, and that the prince has a greater right to any one's personal property, for the public good, than he has himself. In
                           effect, the eastern kings regarded their subjects as slaves. But those who governed the Hebrews were to follow a different
                           conduct; and Samuel is so far from approving of what some of them would do, that he mentions their tyranny, in order to dissuade
                           the people from what they so inconsiderately requested. (Calmet) --- The misconduct of rulers, is one of the most trying inconveniences
                           to which a nation can be exposed. In such circumstances, "bear, says a pagan historian, (Haydock) with the luxury and avarice
                           of those who hold dominion, as with other natural evils. There will be vices as long as men subsist, but neither will these
                           continue for ever, and they are compensated by the intervention of better things or men." <i>Meliorum interventu pensantur.</i>
                           (Tacitus) --- Grotius at last seems to conclude, (Sup. c. iv. p. 97) that the right of the king here specified is only apparent,
                           in as much as it includes "the obligation of making no resistance." (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           other kings, Leviticus xxvii. 30. Joseph had asserted the fifth part of the revenues of Egypt for its monarchs, Genesis xlvii.
