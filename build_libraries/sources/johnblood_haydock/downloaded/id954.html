                           The stone here specified was probably alabaster, as it was used for the pavement. There is a very fine species at Damascus,
                           and in Arabia, which was much sought after to decorate buildings. (Calmet) --- Chaldean has "emeralds." Septuagint, "stones
                           of perfection, rich and various, and every precious stone, and much Parion." (Haydock) --- But [in] Isaias liv. 11, they translate
                           the same term, "carbuncle." (Calmet) --- The stone might resemble the agate, which is beautifully shaded with clouds and other
                           fanciful figures. (Tirinus) --- <i>Paros:</i> this is taken from the Septuagint. Hebrew has simply, "and stones of ssiss."
                           (Haydock) --- Whether it denote the isle of Chio, or that of Chitis, in the Red Sea, the former famous for marble, and the
                           latter for the topaz; or it may refer to Sais, a city of Egypt, which had most beautiful porphyry. (Pliny, [Natural History?]
                           xxxvi. 7., and xxxvii. 8.) --- But Paros, one of the Cyclades, was most renowned for its white marble. (Pliny xxxvi. 5.) ---
                           Josephus (Jewish Wars vi. 6.) informs us, that the temple was built of large white marble stones; so that it appeared, at
                           a distance, to be covered with snow. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           he exhorted the princes to contribute, with all their power, and set them this noble example, which they endeavoured to imitate.
                           (Haydock) --- He had collected some of the gold of <i>Ophir,</i> which was esteemed the best. (Calmet) See 3 Kings ix. 28.
