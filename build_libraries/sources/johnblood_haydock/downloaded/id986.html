                           <i>Manasses.</i> The pious king thought he might give a general invitation, without umbrage. King Osee was not so impious
                           as his predecessors, 4 Kings xvii. 2. Afflictions had made his people more docile. The Jews say (Calmet) that the golden calves
                           had been taken away by the Assyrians, and that the king removed the guards, which had been placed to hinder his subjects from
                           repairing to Jerusalem. (Menochius) (Salien, the year of the world 3305.) --- Ezechias writes privately to the house of Joseph,
                           as the people were prouder on account of the royal dignity. (St. Jerome, Trad.)</font></p><b>

                           and the that he ought to have allowed those who were pure to celebrate the feast in due time. (Selden, Syn. ii. 1.) --- But
                           the Caraite Jews deny this pretended leap-year; and we see that Ezechias acted according to the advice of the princes, and
                           that the Scripture praises his conduct. (Calmet) --- Those who had a lawful impediment, were authorized to put off the feast
                           till the second month, Numbers ix. 10. The nation was under this predicament, as they had not priests at hand, (Tirinus) nor

                           <i>Levites,</i> who received the paschal lambs from the unsanctified. (Menochius) --- The law does not require the ministry
                           of the tribe of Levi for this purpose, as each one might kill the paschal victim at home. But the people were not sufficiently
                           purified on this occasion. (Lyranus) --- At other times, laics killed the victims, if they were clean, Exodus xii. 6. After
                           the tabernacle was set up, the priests poured out the blood on the altar; and, in latter ages, they slew the victim according
                           to Grotius. But the texts of Josephus ([Antiquities?] x. 5., and Jewish Wars vi. 45. Lat. vii. 17.; Haydock) are inconclusive;
                           and Philo repeatedly asserts that, on one day, the law authorizes all the people to sacrifice: and, though he lived at Alexandria,
                           his testimony respecting a fact of public notoriety, is not to be rejected. Only the unclean applied to the Levites on this
                           occasion, and the latter had no more right to sacrifice than the rest. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           of Israel, which had been so long rebellious, for fear lest they should return no more; and because they had shewn a good
                           will in procuring the Levites to slay the victims for them, as that was rightly judged a more sacred action than to partake
                           of the feast. The law forbade, nevertheless, the unclean to approach to any thing sacred, Leviticus xv. 31., and xxii. 4.,
                           and Numbers ix. 6. (Calmet) --- But a dispensation was granted, (Menochius) as the Passover could not be celebrated in any
                           but the first or the second month. The people had come with such eagerness, that they had not time to acquire the purity required.
