                           probably meant, who opposed the entrance of Philopator into the sanctuary, after he had offered sacrifice for him, in the
                           pompous manner here described. (Bossuet) (iii. Machabees) (Calmet) --- <i>Temple.</i> Which began to want repairs. (Menochius)

                           who abode in Mount Seir, the Philistines, and the Samaritans, who dwelt in Sichem, and had their schismatical temple in that
                           neighbourhood. (Challoner) --- This was the source of continual dissensions. (Josephus, [Jewish Antiquities?] xi. 8., and
                           xii. 2.) (John iv. 20.) --- The Jews and Samaritans are still at variance. The former, in the days of Esdras, pronounced a
                           curse against the latter, forbidding any of them to become converts to their religion, (Grotius) which, if true, shews a very
                           blameable malice. See Deuteronomy xxvii. 4. (Haydock) --- <i>Which,</i> &amp;c., is omitted in Greek. These three nations
                           had evinced the greatest hatred towards the Jews, and thus deserved to be accounted objects of horror, though if the author
                           harboured any ill-will, his conduct is not praised, (Calmet) but only recorded. (Haydock) --- The Samaritans consisted of
                           Assyrians, Jews, &amp;c., and therefore are styled no nation; and they were foolish in mixing idolatry with the true worship.
