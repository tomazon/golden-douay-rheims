                           that he had created the world, and that he still retained dominion over it, (St. Augustine, q. 91, 92,) requiring the spontaneous
                           fruits of that year as a tribute, part of which he gave to the poor. In the mean time, all creatures rested from their labours,
                           and the people were taught to have an entire confidence in Providence. (Calmet) --- This law was given in the desert of <I>Sinai,</I>
                           in the month of Nisan, the second year after the exit: but it did not begin to be in force, till the Hebrews <I>entered into

                           the proprietor, (Calmet) though he might take the <I>first,</I> or choicest fruit, for his own use, (Menochius,) or at least

                           even those Hebrew slaves, whose ears had been pierced, and those who had sold their land, regained their liberty and possessions.

                           It is dubious whether the 49th or the 50th year was appointed for the jubilee. The former year is fixed upon by many able
                           chronologers, who remark, that if two years of rest had occurred together, it would have been a serious inconvenience; and
                           Moses might have said the 50th year for a round number, or comprise therein the year of the former jubilee, as we give five
                           years to the olympiad, and eight days to the week, though the former consists only of four years, and the latter of seven
                           days. (Rader; Scaliger; &amp;c.) But others decide for the fiftieth year, ver. 10. (Philo; Josephus, [Antiquities] iii. 10.;
                           St. Augustine, q. 92.; Salien; &amp;c.) (Calmet) --- On the feast of expiation of the 49th year, they promulgated the following
                           to be the year of jubilee. (Menochius) --- Usher places the first in the year of the world 2609, 49 years after the <I>partition</I>
                           of the land by Josue in 2560: Salien dates 50 years from the <I>entrance</I> (ver. 2,) of the Hebrews into Chanaan, in the
                           year of the world 2583, six years sooner; and places the first jubilee [in]&nbsp; 2633, immediately after the sabbatic year,
                           which fell in the 32nd year of Othoniel. He supposes that both were proclaimed at the same time, on the 1st of Tisri, <I>Ros
                           Hassana,</I> "the head of the year;" though the heralds went about the country only on the 10th. The writers both of the Synagogue
                           and of the Church generally adopt the 50th for the year of jubilee; and the pretended inconvenience of two years' rest is
                           nugatory, since God promised a three years' crop, ver. 21. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           that is, a general release and discharge from debts and bondage, and a reinstating of every man in his former possessions.
                           (Challoner) --- <I>Jubilee:</I> Hebrew <I>jubol </I>means "liberty" (Josephus); "re-establishment" (Philo); (Calmet) --- "deliverance"
                           (Abenezra). The Rabbins falsely assert, that a ram's horn was used on this occasion: but Bochart shews that it is solid and
                           unfit for the purpose. (B. ii. 42.) They also maintain, that from the 1st of this <I>sacred month,</I> as it is called by
                           Philo, till the 10th, the slaves spent their time in continual rejoicings in their master's house, and on the latter day they
                           were set free. Cunæus (Rep., i. 6,) observes, that the jubilee was discontinued after the captivity, though the sabbatic year
                           was still kept. (Calmet) --- Indeed the Jews were often very negligent in these respects, and God complained and punished
                           them for it, chap. xxvii. 32.; &amp;c. The avarice of the great ones chiefly caused these wise regulations to be despised,
                           though, from time to time, God enforced their observance, that it might be clearly known from what family the Messias sprung.
                           After his birth they were abrogated, as no longer necessary. (Haydock) --- Something similar was instituted by Solon, and
                           styled "the shaking off burdens," for the redemption both of men and goods. (Laertius) (Menochius) --- The Locrians could
                           not alienate their patrimony. (Aristotle, polit. ii. 7, and vi. 4.) The Rabbins deviate from the spirit of their lawgiver,
                           when they assert, that persons might sell their inheritance for a greater number of years than 50, if they specified how many,
                           &amp;c. (Selden, Succes. iii. 24.) In the Christian dispensation, the jubilee denotes a time of indulgence, in consequence
                           of the power left by Jesus Christ,&nbsp;Matthew xvi. 19 and 2 Corinthians ii. 10.) The first was given by Pope Boniface VIII
                           in 300; and others were granted every century, till Pope Clement VI reduced the space to 50 years, 1542. Pope Gregory XI would
                           have them dispensed to the faithful every 33 years, and Pope Paul XI every 25th, that more might partake of so great a benefit.
                           This has been done since his time, and the Popes often grant them when the Church is in great danger, and also in the year
                           when they are consecrated. (Calmet) --- They are designed to promote the fervour of piety, and the remission of punishment
                           due to sin. (Haydock) --- <I>Family.</I> Slaves shall obtain their liberty. This law set a restraint upon the rich, that they
                           might not get possession of too much land, or oppress the poor. Lycurgus, with the same view, established an equality of lands
                           among the Spartans, and Solon acknowledged the propriety of the regulation, which he probably saw practised in Egypt. (Diodorus
                           i.) (Calmet) --- The Agrarian laws at Rome, were often proposed; but they caused nothing but confusion and riot. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           of years, might be a rule to judge how much was to be paid for redemption. (Haydock) --- Thus if a man had engaged to serve
                           20 years for 100 sicles, and at the expiration of 10 years wished to redeem himself, he might do it for half that sum. Some
                           think, that those Hebrews who had sold themselves to a Gentile, sojourning among them, could not take the benefit of the sabbatic
                           year, (Exodus xxi. 6,) because Moses is silent on this head. But this argument is not satisfactory. (Calmet)</FONT></P><FONT
