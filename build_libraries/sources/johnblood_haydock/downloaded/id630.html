                           <i>To-morrow is the new moon.</i> The <i>neomenia,</i> or first day of the moon, kept according to the law, as a festival;
                           and therefore Saul feasted on that day; and expected the attendance of his family. (Challoner) (Numbers x. 10.) --- <i>Moon.</i>
                           Literally, "calends," a Greek word, intimating that the people were informed, or "called" together, on that occasion; as many
                           nations follow the lunar system in the regulation of the year. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins say that people were stationed on
                           the highest hills to observe the first appearance of the moon, and to give notice of it. But for fear of a mistake, two days
                           were observed, as here we see that Saul gave a feast for such a length of time. This, however, is very uncertain. David speaks
                           without any reference to the watchmen, as of a thing well known to all. The reason of Saul's feasting two days, was because
                           one of them was the sabbath. The following work-day David came to Nobe, (ver. 19,) and partook of the loaves which had been
                           changed on the sabbath day, chap. xxi. 6., and Leviticus xxiv. 8. ---<i> Sit.</i> The custom of sitting at table seems to
                           have been more ancient than that of lying. The Persians chiefly introduced the latter. They had very low tables, so that one
                           of them was placed under the feet of Alexander, when he sat upon the throne of Darius, which was too high for him. (Curtius
                           v.) Both customs frequently prevailed at the same time, Ecclesiasticus ix. 12., and xxxi. 12. Women probably always sat, as
                           the Chaldean says Esther did, Esther vii. 8. See Athen. i. 14. V. Max. ii. 1. --- <i>Day.</i> The second of the month, after
                           the sabbath was ended. (Calmet) --- Pezron thinks that both the last and first days of the month were festivals. (Du Hamel)</font></p><b>

                           of his distemper; and as the latter had returned to his palace after the first attempt, he might judge that he would do the
                           like now, though he had so lately sought his life. David probably retired to <i>Bethlehem,</i> and returned the third day,
                           when he bid adieu to Jonathan and to the court of Saul for ever, (ver. 21.; Calmet) though he saw Jonathan once more at Ziph,

                           It seems there is a negation too much. Jonathan requests that David would shew mercy to him and to his family; or he is willing

                           may be expressed in the future, as an imprecation made by the two friends against those who should attempt to break the covenant,
                           or to oppose David's reign. Septuagint omit this verse entirely, and translate the following, (<b>17</b>) "and Jonathan continued
                           to swear to David, inasmuch as he loved him, because he loved the soul of the man who loved him." He had such an affection

                           as in the following verse: "I will shoot thrice at wild beasts, with arrows, sending as far as Laarmattarai," so here they

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 So David was hid in the field, and the new moon came, and the king
                                    sat down to eat bread.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And when the king sat down upon his chair (according to custom) which
                                    was beside the wall, Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place appeared empty.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And Saul said nothing that day, for he thought it might have happened
                                    to him, that he was not clean, nor purified.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And when the second day after the new moon was come, David's place
                                    appeared empty again. And Saul said to Jonathan, his son: Why cometh not the son of Isai to meat neither yesterday, nor to-day?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And Jonathan answered Saul: He asked leave of me earnestly to go to
                                    Bethlehem.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And he said: Let me go, for there is a solemn sacrifice in the city,
                                    one of my brethren hath sent for me: and now if I have found favour in thy eyes, I will go quickly, and see my brethren. For
                                    this cause he came not to the king's table.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 Then Saul being angry against Jonathan, said to him: Thou son of a
                                    woman that is the ravisher of a man, do I not know that thou lovest the son of Isai to thy own confusion, and to the confusion
                                    of thy shameless mother?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 For as long as the son of Isai liveth upon earth, thou shalt not be
                                    established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now presently send, and fetch him to me: for he is the son of death.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 And Jonathan answering Saul, his father, said: Why shall he die? what
                                    hath he done?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And Saul caught up a spear to strike him. And Jonathan understood
                                    that it was determined by his father to kill David.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 So Jonathan rose from the table in great anger, and did not eat bread
                                    on the second day after the new moon. For he was grieved for David, because his father had put him to confusion.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And when the morning came, Jonathan went into the field according
                                    to the appointment with David, and a little boy with him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And he said to his boy: Go, and fetch me the arrows which I shoot.
                                    And when the boy ran, he shot another arrow beyond the boy.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 The boy therefore came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had
                                    shot: and Jonathan cried after the boy, and said: Behold the arrow is there further beyond thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 And Jonathan cried again after the boy, saying: Make haste speedily,
                                    stand not. And Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and brought them to his master:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 And he knew not at all what was doing: for only Jonathan and David
                                    knew the matter.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 Jonathan therefore gave his arms to the boy, and said to him: Go,
                                    and carry them into the city.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 And when the boy was gone, David rose out of his place, which was
                                    towards the south, and falling on his face to the ground, adored thrice: and kissing one another, they wept together; but
                                    David more.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 And Jonathan said to David: Go in peace: and let all stand that we
                                    have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord, saying: The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for
                                    ever.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 And David arose, and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</font></p>
