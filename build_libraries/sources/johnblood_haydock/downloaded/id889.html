                           believes that the prophet was thus admonished to comply <i>exactly</i> with his injunctions, and to leave nothing unfinished;
                           as God says, <i>by the way that he came, he shall return,</i> (Isaias xxxvii. 34.) to denote that Sennacherib's attempts should

                           of God; the more, because he pretended a revelation for what he did; (Challoner; Worthington) though he did it with a good
                           intention, and supposed that the prophet had only been forbidden to eat with Jeroboam and his followers. (Theodoret, q. 42.)
                           --- This lie might cause him to be styled, "a false prophet," by Josephus. Abulensis thinks he was a wicked man, like Balaam;
                           and many suppose that he was the chief instrument in deluding the king. (Josephus; St. Gregory, &amp;c.) --- After the man
                           of God had been torn to pieces, he might easily persuade the people that he was only an impostor, and that the pretended miracles
                           were merely the effects of natural causes. It is not certain that this man was inspired by God, ver. 20. --- <i>Deceived.</i>

                           (Challoner) --- He had received a positive order, and ought to have tried <i>the spirits,</i> whether they were from God,
                           1 John iv. 1., and Galatians vi. 18. Every prophecy which contradicts the word of God, comes from an evil principle. (Calmet)
                           --- The prophet might suppose, however, that some cause had intervened, which authorized him to eat with this his brother,
                           (ver. 30.) whom he probably revered as a true prophet. Many of God's commands are conditional. (Haydock) --- Serenus observes,
                           that God often inflicts death for the smallest faults. (Cassian vii. 26.) (St. Gregory, Dial. iv. 24.) --- St. Augustine (cura,
                           c. 7.) doubts not of the prophet's salvation. --- <i>Body,</i> without even hurting the ass, ver. 28. (Haydock) --- God protected
                           the relics of his servant, by stationing the lion for a guard. (Procopius) (Menochius) --- How impenetrable are the counsels
                           of God! He suffers Jeroboam, and the prophet who had seduced his servant, to live; while he punishes the latter for a fault
                           which he had committed undesignedly. But he thus purified him from guilt, (Calmet) while he reserved Jeroboam for more lasting
                           torments in another world. (Haydock) --- Nothing could prove more forcibly the existence of future rewards and punishments.
                           (Calmet) --- Not only the deceiver, but he also who is deceived, so as to transgress God's orders, must be punished. (Worthington)</font></p><b>
