                           death, ascended more glorious, and carried all before him. St. Jerome renders it, <i>who ascendeth,</i> or cometh up, <i>through
                           the deserts;</i> (Challoner) which some explain of the coming out of Egypt, others of the progress of the gospel, in a western

                           in his <i>house,</i> which is the Church, 1 Timothy iii. 15. (Challoner) --- Hebrew may signify, "He maketh those who were
                           alone (steriles) to dwell in a house," Psalm cxii. 9. He builds up their houses, and grants them children. (Flaminius) (Exodus
                           i. 21.) --- The Israelites under Pharao, (Calmet) saw their male issue destroyed, (Haydock) but God enabled them to multiply
                           exceedingly, Exodus i. 12. (Calmet) --- <i>Yechidim</i> means "the solitary," (St. Jerome) and "the united," as the first
                           Christians were. (Berthier) (Acts ii. 44.) (Haydock) --- The Church preserves unity in faith, &amp;c. (St. Cyprian, ep. 76.)
                           (Worthington) --- <i>Bound.</i> The power and mercy of God appears, in his bringing out of their captivity, those who were
                           strongly <i>bound</i> in their sins; and in restoring to his grace those whose behaviour had been most <i>provoking;</i> and
                           who by their evil habits were not only dead, but buried in their <i>sepulchres.</i> (Challoner) --- God's grace moves even
                           the rebellious and negligent will of man, so that it willingly embraces the right path. (Worthington) --- <i>In strength.</i>
                           Houbigant, "to walk freely." The Gentiles were, as it were, buried, before Christ delivered them, (Berthier) as he did those
                           who were once incredulous in the days of Noe, (1 Peter iii. 20., and iv. 6.; St. Athanasius) and God rescued the Israelites
                           from servitude, notwithstanding their repeated provocations, both before and after this mercy. Some translate, (Haydock) Hebrew,
                           "He delivers those who were bound in chains; but the rebels (<i>Egyptians, or faithless Hebrews</i>) have remained in the
                           desert." (Calmet) --- Their bodies have there become a prey to beasts, and to corruption. (Haydock) --- God permitted the
                           rebellious Egyptians to pursue his people. (Menochius)</font></p><b style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

                           his servants, and merited grace for the conversion of innumerable souls. At his ascension, he was accompanied by angels, and
                           by the patriarchs, who had been retained in captivity. (Worthington) --- The rebellious nations were forced to pay tribute,

                                    of God.</P>
                                    <P>4 And let the just feast, and rejoice before God: and be delighted with gladness.</P>
                                    <P>5 Sing ye to God, sing a psalm to his name: make a way for him who ascendeth upon the west: the Lord is his name.</P>
                                    <P>Rejoice ye before him: <I>but the wicked</I> shall be troubled at his presence, 6 <I>who is</I> the father of orphans,
                                    and the judge of widows.</P>
                                    <P>God in his holy place:</P>
                                    <P>7 God who maketh <I>men </I>of one manner to dwell in a house:</P>
                                    <P>Who bringeth out them that were bound in strength; in like manner them that provoke, that dwell in sepulchres.</P>
                                    <P>8 O God, when thou didst go forth in the sight of thy people, when thou didst pass through the desert:</P>
                                    <P>9 The earth was moved, and the heavens dropped at the presence of the God of Sinai, at the presence of the God of Israel.</P>
                                    <P>10 Thou shalt set aside for thy inheritance a free rain, O God: and it was weakened, but thou hast made it perfect.</P>
                                    <P>11 In it shall thy animals dwell; in thy sweetness, O God, thou hast provided for the poor.</P>
                                    <P>12 The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings with great power.</P>
                                    <P>13 The king of powers <I>is </I>of the beloved, of the beloved; and the beauty of the house shall divide spoils.</P>
                                    <P>14 If you sleep among the midst of lots, <I>you shall be as the</I> wings of a dove covered with silver, and the hinder
                                    parts of her back with the paleness of gold.</P>
                                    <P>15 When he that is in heaven appointeth kings over her, they shall be whited with snow in Selmon.</P>
                                    <P>16 The mountain of God is a fat mountain.</P>
                                    <P>A curdled mountain, a fat mountain. 17 Why suspect ye curdled mountains?</P>
                                    <P>A mountain in which God is well pleased to dwell: for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end.</P>
                                    <P>18 The chariot of God is attended by ten thousands; thousands of them that rejoice: the Lord is among them in Sinai, in
                                    the holy place.</P>
                                    <P>19 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive; thou hast received gifts in men.</P><I>
                                    <P>Yea, for</I> those also that do not believe, the dwelling of the Lord God.</P>
                                    <P>20 Blessed be the Lord day by day: the God of our salvation will make our journey prosperous to us.</P>
                                    <P>21 Our God is the God of salvation: and of the Lord, of the Lord <I>are </I>the issues from death.</P>
                                    <P>22 But God shall break the heads of his enemies: the hairy crown of them that walk on in their sins.</P>
                                    <P>23 The Lord said: I will turn <I>them </I>from Basan, I will turn <I>them </I>into the depth of the sea.</P>
                                    <P>24 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies: the tongue of thy dogs be red with the same.</P>
                                    <P>25 They have seen thy goings, O God, the goings of my God: of my king who is in <I>his </I>sanctuary.</P>
                                    <P>26 Princes went before joined with singers, in the midst of young damsels playing on timbrels.</P>
                                    <P>27 In the churches bless ye God the Lord, from the fountains of Israel.</P>
                                    <P>28 There <I>is </I>Benjamin a youth, in ecstacy of mind.</P>
                                    <P>The princes of Juda <I>are </I>their leaders: the princes of Zabulon, the princes of Nephthali.</P>
                                    <P>29 Command thy strength, O God: confirm, O God, what thou hast wrought in us.</P>
                                    <P>30 From thy temple in Jerusalem, kings shall offer presents to thee.</P>
                                    <P>31 Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds, the congregation of bulls, with the kine of the people; <I>who seek</I> to exclude
                                    them who are tried with silver.</P>
                                    <P>Scatter thou the nations that delight in wars: 32 ambassadors shall come out of Egypt: Ethiopia shall soon stretch out
                                    her hands to God.</P>
                                    <P>33 Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth: sing ye to the Lord:</P>
                                    <P>Sing ye to God, 34 who mounteth above the heaven of heavens, to the east.</P>
                                    <P>Behold he will give to his voice the voice of power, 35 give ye glory to God, for Israel, his magnificence, and his power
                                    <I>is </I>in the clouds.</P>
                                    <P>36 God is wonderful in his saints: the God of Israel is he who will give power and strength to his people. Blessed be God.</P></FONT></FONT>
