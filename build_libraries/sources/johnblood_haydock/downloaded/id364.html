                           behaviour, in order that he might put a stop to it. --- <I>He accused.</I> Some editions of the Septuagint read, "they accused
                           him," &amp;c.; but all others confirm the Vulgate and Hebrew. (Calmet) --- <I>Crime:</I> perhaps of sodomy, or bestiality

                           hell;</I> that is, into <I>limbo,</I> the place where the souls of the just were received before the death of our Redeemer.
                           For allowing that the word <I>hell</I> sometimes is taken for the <I>grave,</I> it cannot be so taken in this place; since
                           Jacob did not believe his son to be in the <I>grave,</I> (whom he supposed to be devoured by a wild beast) and therefore could
                           not mean to go down to him thither: but certainly meant the place of rest, where he believed his soul to be. (Challoner) ---
                           <I>Soal,</I> or sheol, <I>to crave,</I> denotes the receptacle of the dead, (Leigh) or a lower region; the grave for the body;
                           <I>limbo,</I> or <I>hell,</I> when speaking of the soul. See Delrio, Adag. in 2 Kings, p. 209. (Haydock) --- Protestants here
                           translate it, "the grave," being unwilling to admit a third place in the other world for the soul. See the contrary in St.
                           Augustine, ep. 99[164?], ad Evod.; City of God xx. 15. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           except in that of Jesus Christ, of whom Joseph was a beautiful figure. He was born when his father was grown old, as Jesus

                                    <p>1 And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan, wherein his father sojourned.*</p>
                                    <p>2 And these are his generations: *Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being
                                    but a boy: and he was with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha, his father's wives: and he accused his brethren to his father of
                                    a most wicked crime.</p>
                                    <p>3 Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours.</p>
                                    <p>4 And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than all his sons, hated him, and could not speak peaceably
                                    to him.</p>
                                    <p>5 Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him the more.</p>
                                    <p>6 And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed.</p>
                                    <p>7 I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, and stood, and your sheaves standing about
                                    bowed down before my sheaf.</p>
                                    <p>8 His brethren answered : Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his
                                    dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred.</p>
                                    <p>9 He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon,
                                    and eleven stars worshipping me.</p>
                                    <p>10 And when he had told this to his father, and brethren, his father rebuked him, and said: What meaneth this dream that
                                    thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth?</p>
                                    <p>11 His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the thing with himself.</p>
                                    <p>12 And when his brethren abode in Sichem, feeding their father's flocks,</p>
                                    <p>13 Israel said to him: Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them. And when he answered:</p>
                                    <p>14 I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again
                                    what is doing. So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem:</p>
                                    <p>15 And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought.</p>
                                    <p>16 But he answered: I seek my brethren, tell me where they feed the flocks.</p>
                                    <p>17 And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went
                                    forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.</p>
                                    <p>18 And when they saw him afar off, before he came nigh them, they thought to kill him:</p>
                                    <p>19 And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh.</p>
                                    <p>20 Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit: and we will say: Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then
                                    it shall appear what his dreams avail him.</p>
                                    <p>21 *And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, and said:</p>
                                    <p>22 Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your
                                    hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father.</p>
                                    <p>23 And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours:</p>
                                    <p>24 And cast him into an old pit where there was no water.</p>
                                    <p>25 And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Galaad, with their camels, carrying
                                    spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt.</p>
                                    <p>26 And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood?</p>
                                    <p>27 It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh.
                                    His brethren agreed to his words.</p>
                                    <p>28 *And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty
                                    pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt.**</p>
                                    <p>29 And Ruben returning to the pit, found not the boy:</p>
                                    <p>30 And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear, and whither shall I go?</p>
                                    <p>31 And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed :</p>
                                    <p>32 Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or not.</p>
                                    <p>33 And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured
                                    Joseph.</p>
                                    <p>34 And tearing his garments, he put on sackcloth, mourning for his son a long time.</p>
                                    <p>35 And all his children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but
                                    said: I will go down to my son into hell, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping,</p>
                                    <p>36 The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, an eunuch of Pharao, captain of the soldiers.</p>
