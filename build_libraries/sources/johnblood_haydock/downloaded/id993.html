                           are connected. Spinosa infers, from this book being inserted after Daniel in the Hebrew Bible, that the same author wrote
                           both. But the order of the books in the Septuagint and Vulgate is far more natural, (Calmet) and this has often varied in
                           Hebrew, &amp;c. (Kennicott) See 2 Paralipomenon xxxvi. 23. (Haydock) --- <i>First.</i> The design was only put in execution
                           the following year. (The year of the world 3468.) --- <i>Cyrus</i> (Hebrew <i>coresh,</i> (Haydock) or Koresch) means "the
                           sun," according to Ctesias and Plutarch. Josephus ([Antiquities?] xi. 1.) informs us that this prince became a friend of the
                           Jews, in consequence of having seen the prediction of Isaias (xliv. 28., and xlv. 1.) fulfilled in his own person. He took
                           Babylon, the year of the world 3466, and established the Persian empire, which was subverted by Alexander. (Calmet) --- He
                           had before ruled over Persia 27 years, and only reigned three as sole monarch at Babylon. (Tirinus) --- <i>The Lord;</i> every
                           good notion, even in infidels, proceeds from him. (Du Hamel) --- Cyrus was one of the best and greatest conquerors of antiquity.
                           He was the son of Cambyses, by Mandane, princess of Media. Xenophon informs us that he died in his bed; (Haydock) and had
                           been lately conquered. (Tirinus)</font></p><b>

                           1. (Menochius) --- The dominions of Cyrus were very extensive, (Xenophon, Cyrop. i. and viii.) reaching from Ethiopia to the
                           Euxine sea, &amp;c. He acknowledges that he received all from the hand of God. Nabuchodonosor makes a similar confession of
                           his supreme dominion; (Daniel ii. 47.) and the potentates of Egypt and of Rome, procured sacrifices to be offered to him.
                           But what advantage did they derive from this sterile knowledge of his divinity? since they did not honour him accordingly,
                           but wished to join his worship with that of idols; though the force of miracles and of reason must have convinced them that
                           there is but one God. (Calmet) --- <i>House,</i> or temple, Isaias xliv. 28. --- <i>Judea.</i> So the Septuagint read, but
                           the Hebrew has "Juda," all along. The whole country now began to be known by the former name. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           and Nehemias. Many did not return at all. Cyrus allowed them full liberty. He permits money to be exported, particularly the
                           half sicle, required [in] Exodus xxx. 13, and all voluntary contributions for the temple. (Grotius) (Calmet) --- He also enjoins
                           the prefects of the provinces, (ver. 6., and chap. iii. 7.) whom Josephus styles "the king's friends," to forward the work;
