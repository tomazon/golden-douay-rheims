                           <p><strong>Notes &amp; Commentary:</strong></p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 1.</b> <i>The descriptions.</i> That is, the records or memoirs of Jeremias, a work that is now lost. (Challoner)
                           --- It was extant, the year before Christ 142. (Calmet) --- St. Ambrose (Of. iii. 14.) writes at large concerning this miracle.
                           (Worthington)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 2.</b> <i>Of them.</i> He alludes to his epistle, (Calmet) Baruch vi. 11. (Worthington)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 4.</b> <i>And the ark.</i> These were not taken by the Chaldeans, Jeremias lii. (Menochius) --- Whether they
                           were removed before or after the capture of the city, is disputed. (Salien, the year [of the world] 3446.) --- Besides the
                           authority of this book, it is most probabe that Jeremias should have preserved them, as he was high in favour, Jeremias xxxix.
                           11. (Worthington) --- Hence most believe that Nabuzardan granted him leave. (Calmet) --- Eupolemus says Nabuchodonosor did
                           this after he took the city. (Eusebius, præp. ix. 39.) --- Others think the prophet removed them under Joakim, having informed
                           only a few of the priests. (N. Alex.) --- <i>Mountain;</i> Nebo, Deuteronomy xxxii. 49.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 7.</b> <i>Mercy.</i> Whether the ark, &amp;c., were in the second temple, as this seems to insinuate, has been
                           much debated. The negative seems best established and these promises refer to the Messias, prefigured by the ark. God wished
                           to withdraw the Jews by degrees from their attachment to these sensible things, and to raise their minds to those of a more
                           spiritual nature. (St. Ambrose) (Rupert, &amp;c.) (Calmet, Diss.) --- Salien (the year [of the world] 3609) proves at large,
                           that the ark was discovered at the same time as the sacred fire. (Menochius) --- Yet Josephus (Jewish Wars vi. 6.) testifies,
                           that nothing was found in the holy of holies when the Romans took it. Hence others think that the ark will be produced to
                           the Jews by Enoch and Elias. (Ribera, in Aggeus i.) (Tournemine) --- The first opinion gives most satisfaction. When Christ
                           collected his disciples, he received testimony from the Father and from the Holy Ghost in a bright <i>cloud.</i> The figures
                           of the law are at an end, and there will be no need of restoring them at the consummation of all things. (Haydock)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 9.</b> <i>Treated.</i> Greek, "He was manifested, and like one possessing wisdom, he," &amp;c. (Haydock) ---
                           On this occasion, Solomon chiefly displayed his wisdom, praying aloud.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 10.</b> <i>As.</i> Both dedications lasted eight days, and fire descended, Leviticus ix. 23., and 2 Paralipomenon
                           vii. 1.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 11.</b> <i>Consumed.</i> He alludes to what Moses said after the death of Nadab, Leviticus x. 16. (Calmet)
                           --- Fire consumed the sin-offering as well as the rest.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 13.</b> <i>Set down.</i> Greek, "explained." --- <i>Books.</i> The Scriptures were not lost. (Menochius) ---
                           Perhaps before this time no complete collection of them had been made. Esdras would point out and help to discover what had
                           been written. (Calmet) --- The senate of the nation was also present. (Simon Crit. i. 1.) --- <i>David:</i> the psalms. All
                           the other books may be designated under the name of <i>prophets.</i> (Haydock) --- <i>Kings;</i> Cyrus, &amp;c., 1 Esdras
                           vi. 3., &amp;c. Josephus has inserted many such letters in his work. They were like the title-deeds of the nation. (Calmet)
                           --- <i>And.</i> Greek, "regarding the presents;" <i><u>anathematon</u>.</i> (Haydock)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 14.</b> <i>Judas.</i> This seems to be the Essene, who with others wrote this epistle; (chap. i. 10.; Worthington)
                           or rather (Haydock) the Machabee, who was as solicitous to preserve the sacred books as Antiochus was to destroy them, 1 Machabees
                           i. 59., and ii. 48. It is said that another assembly met to admit such books into the canon as had been written since the
                           days of Nehemias.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 15.</b> <i>Things,</i> collected by Judas. The Bible had been translated into Greek before. But some records
                           might still be wanted by the Jews in Egypt. (Calmet)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 16.</b> <i>The purification.</i> This is the feast of the purifying or cleansing of the temple, (Challoner)
                           the 25th of Casleu, chap. i. 9, 18.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 18.</b> <i>Place.</i> They had now liberty to return. What, therefore, can they mean but the coming of the
                           Messias, who was shortly expected? (Calmet) --- Many Jews at this time were scattered in other countries, and did not chose
                           to return, like those of Egypt. The people of Judea wish all would live together, as they had done under Solomon. (Haydock)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 19.</b> <i>Place.</i> Read chap. xv. 38. After the author had written this appendix to the former book, he
                           resolved to add an epitome of the history. Hence in this preface he informs us of the subject, method, reason, and diligence
                           of his short work, ver. 20, 24, 5[25], 6[26], 9[29]. (Worthington) --- This piece is very elegant, and contains several rules
                           for writing history. The author was a Jew as well as Jason, ver. 24.</p>
                           <p><b>Ver. 22.</b> <i>Manifestations:</i> heavenly apparitions, chap. iii. 25., and v. 2. (Calmet)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 25.</b> <i>Multitude.</i> Greek also, "confusion of numbers, and the difficulty attending those who wish to
                           dive into <i><u>eiskukleisthan</u>,</i> (Haydock) or to include <i>much</i> (Calmet) historical relations on account of the
                           quantity of matter." (Haydock)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 27.</b> <i>No easy task,</i> &amp;c. The spirit of God, that assists the sacred penman, does not exempt them
                           from labour in seeking out the matter which they are to treat of, and the order and manner in which they are to deliver it.
                           So St. Luke wrote the gospel, <i>having diligently attained to all things,</i> Luke i. 3. (Challoner) --- This evangelist
                           had to inquire of others. (Worthington) --- Inspiration preserves from all danger of mistake. When something future is <i>revealed,</i>
                           there is less difficulty, as God must then dictate the very words. Hence Jeremias wrote with the utmost ease, as Baruch testified,
                           Jeremias xxxvi. 18, 32. (Haydock) --- The prophets had, therefore, only to write or speak from the mouth of God. Others were
                           excited by him to treat of history, &amp;c., and were preserved from error, but not from labour. (Bellarmine, Verb. i. 15.)
                           --- In vain then do our adversaries attempt to prove that this book is not inspired. (Menochius)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 28.</b> <i>Others.</i> Greek, "have no easy task, so," &amp;c. (Haydock) --- He alludes to the custom of choosing
                           a master of the feast, who had to strive to give general satisfaction, Ecclesiasticus xxxii. 1., and Esther i. 8. (Calmet)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 29.</b> <i>Authors.</i> Greek, "the writer." (Haydock) --- Jason resembles an excellent painter, of whose work
                           we desire to give a copy (Calmet) in miniature, (Haydock) relying entirely on his veracity. (Sa) --- Yet as the Church esteems
                           this work to be canonical, what is extracted must be true, and inspired, though the writer seems not to have known that he
                           had such a privilege. God might still guide his pen. (Menochius) --- The original might also be the work of a sacred writer,
                           as many such appear to have been lost. If it were not, what is here selected cannot be questioned. St. Paul quotes some passages
                           even from heathen poets, which in those cases were true, and thus became part of the word of God. (Haydock)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 30.</b> <i>Master.</i> Such is Jason. I only paint some parts. (Calmet) --- <i>Paint.</i> Greek, "to burn in
                           and represent to the life, must," &amp;c. (Haydock) --- The ancients painted the walls, preparing them by fire, &amp;c. (Vitruvius
                           vii. 5.; Josephus, Antiquities xvii. 12.) (Calmet)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 32.</b> <i>Nice.</i> Greek <i><u>exergastikon</u>,</i> "elaborate disquisitions." Both must equally seek the
                           truth: but long details are not expected in abridgments as they are in a full history. (Haydock)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 33.</b> <i>Itself.</i> The account of Alexander [the Great] should be read next, 1 Machabees i. (Worthington)</p></font><font

                                    the ark at the time of the captivity. The author's preface.</font></p></i>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">1 Now it is found in the descriptions of Jeremias, the prophet, that
                                    he commanded them that went into captivity, to take the fire, as it hath been signified, and how he gave charge to them that
                                    were carried away into captivity.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 And how he gave them the law, that they should not forget the commandments
                                    of the Lord, and that they should not err in their minds, seeing the idols of gold, and silver, and the ornaments of them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 And with other such like speeches, he exhorted them that they would
                                    not remove the law from their heart.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 It was also contained in the same writing, how the prophet, being warned
                                    by God, commanded that the tabernacle and the ark should accompany him, till he came forth to the mountain *where Moses went
                                    up, and saw the inheritance of God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And when Jeremias came thither he found a hollow cave: and he carried
                                    in thither the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar of incense, and so stopped the door.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 Then some of them that followed him, came up to mark the place: but
                                    they could not find it.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And when Jeremias perceived it, he blamed them, saying: The place shall
                                    be unknown, till God gather together the congregation of the people, and receive them to mercy.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And then the Lord will shew these things, and the majesty of the Lord
                                    shall appear, and there shall be a cloud as it was also shewed to Moses, *and he shewed it when Solomon prayed that the place
                                    might be sanctified to the great God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 For he treated wisdom in a magnificent manner: and like a wise man,
                                    he offered the sacrifice of the dedication, and of the finishing of the temple.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 *And as Moses prayed to the Lord, and fire came down from heaven,
                                    and consumed the holocaust: **so Solomon also prayed, and fire came down from heaven and consumed the holocaust.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And Moses said: *Because the sin-offering was not eaten, it was consumed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 So Solomon also celebrated the dedication eight days.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And these same things were set down in the memoirs, and commentaries
                                    of Nehemias: and how he made a library, and gathered together out of the countries, the books both of the prophets, and of
                                    David, and the epistles of the kings, and concerning the holy gifts.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And in like manner Judas also gathered together all such things as

                                    and put to flight the barbarous multitude:</font></p>
