                           Chrysostom takes notice, in his preface to this epistle, that the doctrinal part in the first three chapters is treated in
                           a very sublime manner, with long periods and sentences, which makes the style more perplexed and the sense more obscure than
                           in his other epistles. On this account I shall first give the reader a paraphrase as literal as I can, and then make some
                           short notes on the difficulties in the text. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>
