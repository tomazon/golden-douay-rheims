                           that their kings are descendants of Solomon, by the queen of Saba; and that Azarias, the son of Sadoc, stole the tables of
                           the law, when he brought back his pupil from Jerusalem. (Sanctius) --- This shews their vanity and ignorance. (Calmet) ---
                           Still many suppose that this queen came from their country. (Worthington, &amp;c.) --- <i>Lord,</i> who had raised Solomon
                           to so great splendour, while, on the other hand, the king endeavoured to enhance his glory. (Haydock) --- If we place the
                           stop after Solomon, we may say that the queen was moved by divine grace, and attracted, like the Gabaonites, (Josue ix. 9.)
                           to embrace the true religion; (Calmet) though she seems to have professed it already, as many others did among the Gentiles.
                           (Haydock) --- The Fathers look upon her as a figure of the Christian Church. (St. Hilary, Psalm cxxi.; St. Irenæus iv. 45.,
                           &amp;c.) <i>Barbara natione, non animo.</i> (St. Paulin, ep. 1.) --- <i>Questions.</i> Thus the ancients tried each others

                           <i>Thyine.</i> Pliny ([Natural History?] iii. 16.) mentions a species of tall and incorruptible trees, called thya. The wood
                           was odoriferous, and very costly. <i>Citri et mensarum insania, quas feminæ viris contra margaritas regerunt.</i> (B. xiii.,
                           and xv. 16.) Calypso burnt it, to perfume her whole island. (Homer) --- It was used as a sort of incense in <i>sacrifices,</i>
                           and thence received its name. (Haydock) --- Septuagint translate, "plained;" and elsewhere, <i>pine-trees,</i> which is adopted
                           by St. Jerome, 2 Paralipomenon ii. 8. (Calmet) --- Hebrew reads <i>almuggim</i> in one place, and <i>algumin</i> in the other,
                           the letters being transposed; "for I suppose, says Kennicott, it will hardly be said that these trees were both almug and
                           algum." (Haydock) --- One word might be the Ethiopian pronunciation. (Huet) --- Yet Kimchi observes, that such transpositions
                           of letters are very common among the Hebrews. (Du Hamel) --- Solomon had desired Hiram to send him some algum, or "gum bearing"
                           wood: but as there was not sufficient, or so fine, in Libanus as in Ophir, or in foreign parts, he procured more from those
                           countries. The wood might probably resemble that of <i>settim,</i> or of black acacia, (Exodus xxv. 5.) whence the gum of
                           Arabia is extracted. Acanthos, in Thebais, was celebrated for its fine thorn-trees, and for its gum. (Strabo xvii.) (Calmet)
                           --- It is placed near Memphis. (Pliny, [Natural History?] iv 10.) --- The Rabbins commonly understand the Hebrew to mean,
                           "coral," which is not fit for instruments, much less for architecture. Others translate ebony, or Brazil wood, but without
                           reason. (Calmet) (Tirinus)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Ivory.</i> Hebrew, "of the tooth" (or horn) of elephants: people do not agree of which the ivory is formed. See Pliny ([Natural
                           History?] viii. 3.) for the former sentiment, and for the latter, Varro vi. Ezechiel (xxvii. 15.) seems to unite both sentiments,
                           calling it, "horns of the tooth." (Haydock) --- Ivory may, in effect, be wrought like horn. --- <i>Finest.</i> Hebrew, "gold
                           of Uphas." This was the country whence it was brought; (Jeremias x. 9.) probably Colchis, where the river Phasis, or <i>Phison,</i>
                           flows, Genesis ii. 11. (Calmet) --- The Chaldean calls Uphas, (in Jeremias) Ophir; and Huet supposes that Paz and Parvaim
                           designate the same place, chap. ix. 28., and Job xxviii. 17. (Du Hamel) --- In Paralipomenon, we only read, <i>pure gold,</i>
                           which would suffer the ivory to appear in some places. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           to rest on. In Paralipomenon, St. Jerome translates, "little" <i>arms.</i> The feet might also be made in this shape. Josephus
                           ([Antiquities?] viii. 5.) represents them as forming the seat: (Calmet) and the Septuagint place them on each side: "the fore-parts
                           of oxen, projecting from the back of the throne, and hands on the throne, on each side of the seat." In Paralipomenon also,

                           <i>To Tharsis.</i> This word in Hebrew signifies, "the sea," Isaias ii. 16., and xxiii. 10. (Menochius) --- But when it signifies
                           some particular place, (Haydock) it probably refers to Tarsus of Cilicia, which was once the most famous mart on the Mediterranean,
                           though not perhaps in the days of Solomon, but after it had been embellished by the Assyrian kings. "Ships of Tharsis," often
                           denote such as were fit for a long voyage; and of this description were the fleets of Solomon and of Hiram, which sailed from
                           Asiongaber to Ophir, and touched at various ports, where they procured what they wanted. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "the king had
                           at sea a navy of Tharsis....once in three years: the navy of Tharsis came, bringing gold," &amp;c. (Haydock) --- <i>Teeth.</i>
                           Hebrew <i>Shenhabim.</i> The latter word is commonly rendered elephants, <i>k</i> being lost at the beginning. (Bochart) ---
                           Syriac and Arabic intimate, that the elephants were brought alive. Perhaps <i>n</i> may be dropped after <i>b;</i> so that
                           we should read, <i>ebnim,</i> as [in] Ezechiel xxvii. 15., and translate ivory and <i>ebony;</i> the one being remarkable
                           for its white, and the other for is black colour. Both might be procured on the coasts of Ethiopia, by which the fleet passed.
                           The Persians, and Sesostris, required the people of the country to pay both for tribute. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xii. 14.;
                           Diodorus i.) --- <i>Apes.</i> Hebrew <i>Kophim.</i> Greek,&nbsp;<i><u>Kepos</u></i>. There was a peculiar species in Ethiopia,
                           which the Egyptians adored at Babylon, near Memphis, and was exhibited by Julius Cæsar, in the public shews. (Solin.; Bochart)
                           --- <i>Peacocks</i> is not expressed in the Septuagint. (Calmet) --- The Roman edition, instead of <i>elephants,</i> &amp;c.,
                           inserts, "stones" &amp;c., intended for the various edifices and towns, which Solomon fortified, to keep under the nations
                           of Chanaan, whom he forced to labour, &amp;c. But the Alexandrian copy has, <i><u>taonon</u>,</i> "peacocks," as <i>thuciim</i>
                           is rendered (Haydock) by the Chaldean, Syriac, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- Huet observes, that these birds were scarcely known in
                           the time of Alexander, and would therefore understand , <i>psittacos,</i> "parrots." (Du Hamel) --- But peacocks were called,
                           "birds of Media," as they were very common in that country, (Calmet) and about Babylon. (Diodorus ii.) --- The fleet of Solomon
                           might advance as far as the confines of Media. Josephus adds, that it brought home Ethiopian slaves, who were in high esteem
                           in a country where eunuchs were employed to guard the women, (Calmet) as there would be less danger of too great familiarity.
