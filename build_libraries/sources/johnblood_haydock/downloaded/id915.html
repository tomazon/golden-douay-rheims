                           <i>When he,</i> Joatham, "had begun," <i>c&#339;pisset.</i> (Haydock) --- Thus Junius evades the following difficulty. (Du
                           Hamel) --- <i>Sixteen,</i> consequently he died when he was 36 years old. As Ezechias was 25 when he came to the throne, Achab
                           must have been a father at 11 (Calmet) or 12 years of age. (Bochart, Dissert. xxiii.) --- St. Jerome asserts the same of Solomon,
                           and observes, that "many things which seem incredible in Scripture, are nevertheless true." (ep. ad Vital.) He, with some
                           others, has recourse to a miracle. Others suppose that Ezechias was an adopted son, or kinsman, or that the numbers are incorrect,
                           &amp;c. But we are assured by respectable authors, (Haydock) that people have children very soon in the hotter climates. Busbeque
                           (Ep. 3.) says, in Colchis many are mothers at ten years of age; and to convince the incredulous, produce their infants "not
                           much bigger than a large frog." Albert the Great says he knew one who had a child at 10, and Navarre (following Sanchez, Matthew
                           vii. 2, 5. disp. 104.) was credibly informed that a similar fact was seen at Naples. Mandesle observes that this is common
                           in India. He says one had lately a child at six years of age, which was there thought remarkable. St. Jerome mentions a boy
                           who became a father at 10, and Sanchez relates that the same happened in Spain. A boy under 12 had a child by a girl of 10,
                           in Provence. (Scaliger Elenc.) The Romans laws fix upon the age of 14 for males, and 12 for females' lawfully marrying; (Haydock)
                           though many examples of people having children before that age are produced by Tiraqueau, 6. conn. 36. Yet physicians require
                           13 in males, and 14 years complete in females before they are capable of this effect. (Genebrard) St. Augustine (City of God
                           xv. 11., and xvi. c. ult. and in psalm civ.) maintains that a person of 10 years of age is unfit for generation. (Calmet)
                           --- <i>Malitia supplet ætatem.</i> Achaz was a monster of wickedness. (Haydock) --- In the first year of his reign, and in
                           the fifth Olympiad, the Ephori were appointed at Sparta under Theopompus, nephew of Lycurgus. (Salien, the year before Christ
                           59.)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Fire,</i> to purify him (or them, Paralipomenon <i>filios, </i>all were treated thus. Haydock) according to the superstitions
                           of the pagans: <i>omnia purgat edax ignis.</i> (Ovid, Fast.) (Theodoret, q. 16.) (Menochius) --- Others believe that the child
                           was burnt to death in honour of Moloch, and in imitation of the Chanaanites, Psalm cv. 37., and Deuteronomy xviii. 10. The
                           Carthaginians were required by Gelon, king of Syracuse, to lay aside this most barbarous custom. (Phil. apoph.) Yet, "infants
                           were publicly immolated to Saturn, in Africa, till the proconsulate of Tiberius, who ordered the priests to be exposed on
                           those same trees which shaded their crimes, as on votive crosses. This the soldiers, my countrymen, who executed the proconsul's
                           orders, can testify; and still the sacred crime is perpetrated in secret." (Tertullian, Apol. viii.) --- How tenacious are
                           people of old errors! (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Then.</i> In punishment of such enormous crimes, God first delivered Achaz into the hands of Rasin, (2 Paralipomenon xxviii.;
                           St. Jerome, in Isaias vii.) and afterwards Phacee destroyed 120,000 in one battle, and took 200,000 prisoners, whom the prophet
                           Oded persuaded him to release, 2 Paralipomenon xxviii. 8, 11. Salien (the year before Christ 759.) observes that the two kings
                           then joined their forces, and besieged Jerusalem the following year, but to no purpose. (Haydock) --- Isaias was sent before
                           the siege to encourage Achaz, and to promise the miraculous birth of the Messias, as a sign that he should be delivered: and
                           to convince him of it the more, he foretold that the two kings should be destroyed before his own son should be able to say
                           <i>father,</i> Isaias vii. 8., &amp;c. Yet as Achaz did not still amend his life, God sent the same kings the following year
                           (the year of the world 3263.) to lay waste the country. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           or Elath, which had been taken by Ozias, chap. xiv. 22. (Menochius) --- It seems never to have belonged to <i>Syria,</i> as
                           it was too far from Damascus. Instead of <i>Aram,</i> we should therefore probably read <i>Edom,</i> which words in Hebrew
                           are extremely similar, and have been often mistaken, (Judges xi. 17.; Calmet) particularly as we find that the <i>Edomites</i>
                           took possession of the city. This latter word is indeed <i>Syrians</i> in Hebrew, &amp;c. (Haydock) --- Josephus and others
                           maintain that the Syrians seized and kept the place. But they were most likely only invited by the Idumeans to come to their

                           court, but placed his throne in the temple. (Du Hamel) --- Septuagint, "and the foundation of the chair he built in the house
                           of the Lord." (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "and the (<i>musac</i>) covert, <i>or</i> tribune of the sabbath, which they had built

                           He despoiled these rich ornaments, to gratify the Assyrian. (Haydock) --- Solomon had built a most magnificent tribune, 2
                           Paralipomenon vi. 13. See chap. xi. 6. The <i>musach of Juda,</i> was the pulpit; from which the law was read, Isaias xxii.
                           8. The king's tribune was near the eastern gate, which was only opened on the sabbath, Ezechiel xlvi. 1. Some believe that
                           the <i>musach</i> was a large curtain, suspended over the court, to keep off the sun's beams. Eupolemus speaks of some very
                           magnificent ones, (Eusebius, præp. ix. 34.) as does also Josephus; such as those which covered the Roman theatres. Others
                           think it was a tent for the priests to take a little rest, or for the door-keepers, or a chest designed to receive the contributions
                           for the repairs of the temple, or for the king to distribute his alms, or a covered throne for him to sit down on. (Calmet)</font></p><b>
