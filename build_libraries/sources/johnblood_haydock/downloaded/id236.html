                           Do not be troubled at the many evils, persecutions, and heresies, which rise up against the Church. There have ever existed
                           such since the Church was first established, and such ever will exist. Did not Jannes and Mambres rise up against Moses? (Calmet)

                           days. We may observe that few agree exactly in translating or expounding the sense of so many Greek or Latin words, which
                           express the vices of such heretics; but the difference is so small, that it need not be taken notice of. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           age. For there never existed a time, either under the Old or New Testaments, in which such have not appeared. Even in the
                           apostle's time, we behold heresies and disorders in the Church. We see them increase rapidly after their decease. Simon, the
                           magician, seems to have been dead when St. Paul wrote this epistle, which was but a short time before his martyrdom. But he
                           had left a great number of disciples behind him, known by the numerous sects, the Gnostics, the Simonians, the Encratians,
                           &amp;c. &amp;c. into which, after the death of their master, they were split. (Calmet) --- <I>Who creep</I>[1] <I>into houses

                           tom. iv. part 2. p. 477. Nov. edit., where he brings a number of instances, from Simon Magus to his time. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           the Scriptures, their names might be known by tradition. (Witham) --- Since the Old Testament does not mention these magicians
                           of Pharao, who opposed Moses, it seems probable that St. Paul either learnt their names by a particular revelation, as St.
                           Chrysostom, Theophylactus, and Tirinus think, or by some tradition of the Jews, agreeably to the opinions of Theodoret, Grotius,
                           Estius, &amp;c. Others think he might have found their names in some ancient histories, which have not reached our time; or
                           perhaps from the apocryaphal book of Jannes and Mambres, mentioned by Origen and Ambrosiaster. Certain it is, that in St.
                           Paul's time the names of these two famous magicians were very well known; thus it is by no means necessary in this instance
                           to have recourse to a particular inspiration. The Orientals say there were many magicians who opposed Moses. Among others,
                           they mention Sabous and Gadous, who came from Thebias; Graath and Mospha, from some other country. They wished, as they inform
                           us, to imitate the miracle by which Moses turned his rod into a serpent, by throwing their canes on the ground, and ropes
                           filled with quicksilver. These ropes began to move a little, one twisting with another, on account of the heat of the earth
                           warmed by the sun. But the rod of Moses in a moment broke them to pieces. (Calmet) --- These magicians are called by different
                           names. The Greek has Jannes and Jambres. Some ancient writers, Jannes and Mambres; as St. Cyprian, Optatus, (chap. 7.) Born.
                           &amp;c. The Jews call that Joanne, or Johanna, whom the Greeks name Jannes; and that called by the Jews Jambres, the Greeks
                           name Mambres. The Hebrews would have them to be the sons of Balaam, the soothsayer, and the masters of Moses in the sciences
                           of the Egyptians. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           answer, that the heretics became worse, and seduced very many in all ages, but the providence of God always put a stop to
                           their progress, so that they could never prevail against the Church, as they hoped and proposed to do. (Witham) --- St. Paul

                           Timothy, who had been long since instructed in all the truths and mysteries of the Christian faith, who had received the gifts
                           of the Holy Ghost, of prophecy, of interpreting the Scriptures, who was a priest, a bishop of Ephesus, the metropolis of Asia,
                           whose office it was to instruct, direct, and convert others. He tells this great bishop, that <I>the holy Scriptures</I> are
                           able, and may conduce or can <I>instruct</I> him <I>unto salvation,</I> (ver. 15.) unto his own salvation and that of others.

                           scripture divinely inspired is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct,</I> or admonish, <I>to instruct</I> others <I>in
                           justice,</I> and in the ways of virtue, that thus he who is a man of God, a minister of the gospel, may be perfect and instructed
                           unto every good work. But when our adversaries of the pretended reformation, undertake from these four verses to shew, first,
                           that every ignorant man or woman is hereby warranted to read and put what construction his or her private spirit, or private
                           judgment, suggests upon all places of the holy Scriptures; and secondly, that the Scriptures alone contain all truths which
                           a Christian is bound to believe; or at least, that the Scriptures teach him all things necessary to salvation, without regard
                           to the interpretation and authority of the Catholic Church: I may at least say (without examining at present any other pretended
                           grounds of these assertions) that these consequences are very remote from the text and sense of St. Paul in this place. As
                           to the first, does this follow; the Scriptures must be read by Timothy, a priest, a bishop, a man of God, a minister of the
                           gospel, whose office it is to instruct and convert others, therefore they are proper to be read and expounded by every ignorant
                           man or woman? Does not St. Paul say elsewhere, (2 Corinthians ii. 17.) that <I>many adulterate</I> and corrupt <I>the word
                           of God?</I> does not St. Peter tell us also, (2 Peter iii. 16.) that in St. Paul's epistles <I>are some things....which the
                           unlearned and unstable wrest, as also the other scriptures, to their own perdition?</I> See the preface to the Gospel of St.
                           John, where reasons are brought for which it was requisite that the Church should put some restraint to the abuse which the
                           ignorant made of reading the Scriptures in vulgar tongues. As to the second consequence, does it follow: every Scripture divinely
                           inspired is <I>profitable</I> for St. Timothy, for a priest, a bishop, a man of God, a minister and preacher of the gospel,
                           to teach and instruct, and conduce to bring both him and others to salvation; therefore they contain all things that a Christian
                           need to believe? &amp;c. Is not every Christian bound to believe that the books in the canon of the New and Old Testament
                           are of divine authority, as in particular these two epistles of St. Paul to Timothy? Where does the Scripture assure us of
                           this? But of this elsewhere. (Witham) --- Every part of divine Scripture is certainly <I>profitable</I> for all these ends.
                           But if we would have the <I>whole</I> rule of Christian faith and practice, we must not be content with those Scriptures which
                           Timothy <I>knew from his infancy,</I> (that is, with the Old Testament alone) nor yet with the New Testament, without taking
                           along with it the traditions of the apostles and the interpretation of the Church, to which the apostles delivered both the
                           book and the true meaning of it. (Challoner)</FONT></P>
