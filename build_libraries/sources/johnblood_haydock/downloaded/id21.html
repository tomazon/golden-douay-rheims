                           <I>Judge not,</I>[1] or condemn not others rashly, that you may not be judged or condemned. (Witham) --- St. Jerome observes,
                           Christ does not altogether forbid judging, but directs us how to judge. Where the thing does not regard us, we should not
                           undertake to judge. Where it will bear a favourable interpretation, we should not condemn. Magistrates and superiors, whose
                           office and duty require them to judge faults, and for their prevention to condemn and punish them, must be guided by evidence,
                           and always lean towards the side of mercy, where there are mitigating circumstances. Barefaced vice and notorious sinners
                           should be condemned and reprobated by all. (Haydock) --- In this place, nothing more is meant than that we should always interpret
                           our neighbor's actions in the most favourable light. God permits us to judge of such actions as cannot be done with a right
                           intention, as murder. As to indifferent actions, we must always judge in the most favourable sense. There are two things in
                           which we must be particularly on our guard: 1. With what intention such an action was done. 2. Whether the person who appears
                           wicked will not become good. (St. Jerome)</FONT></P><B>

                           rule, which God will infallibly follow, should put a check to the freedom with which we so frequently condemn our neighbour.
                           (Haydock) --- As we behave towards our neighbours, interpreting their actions with charitableness, and excusing their intentions
                           with mildness; or, on the contrary, judging them with severity, and condemning them without pity; so shall we receive our
                           judgment. (Menochius) --- As the pardon of our sins is proportioned to the pardon we afford to others, so also will our judgment
                           be proportioned to the judgment we pass on others. If our neighbour be surprised by sin, we must not reproach or confound
                           him for it, but mildly admonish him. Correct your brother, not as an enemy, taking revenge, but as a physician, administering
                           appropriate remedies, assisting him with prudent counsels, and strengthening him in the love of God. (St. Chrysostom, hom.

                           having preached these great and wonderful truths, after having commanded his apostles to keep themselves free from the vices
                           of mankind, and make themselves like not to angels or archangels only, but to the Lord of all things; and not only observe
                           justice themselves, but likewise to labour for the correction of others, lest they should be disheartened at these almost
                           insurmountable difficulties: our Redeemer subjoins, Ask, and you shall receive, &amp;c. When we offer our petitions to the
                           Almighty, we must imitate the example of Solomon, who immediately obtained what he asked of the Lord, because he asked what
                           he ought. Two things, therefore, are necessary to every prayer, that it be offered up with perseverance and fervour, and that
                           it contain a lawful prayer. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxiv.) --- The reasons why so many do not obtain the effects of their prayers,
                           are,---1st. Because they ask for what is evil; and he that makes such a request, offers the Almighty an intolerable injury
                           by wishing to make him, as it were, the author of evil: 2nd. Although what they ask be not evil, they seek it for an evil
                           end. (St. James iv.): 3rd. Because they who pray, are themselves wicked; (St. John ix.) for God doth not hear sinners: 4th.
                           Because they ask with no faith, or with faith weak and wavering: (St. James i.) 5th. Because although what we ask be good
                           in itself, yet the Almighty refuses it, in order to grant us a greater good: 6th. Because God wishes us to persevere, as he
                           declares in the parable of the friend asking bread, Luke, ch. ii.; and that we may esteem his gifts the more: 7th. We do not
                           always receive what we beg, because, according to St. Augustine, (lib. ii, de Serm. Dom. et epis. 34, ad Paulinum) God often
                           does not grant us what we petition for, that he may grant us something more useful and profitable. (Maldonatus)</FONT></P><B>

                           when compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. (St. Chrysostom) --- It may also be added that God, by his heavenly
                           consolations, makes them not only supportable, but even easy and pleasant. Thus the martyrs occasionally did not feel their

                           (2 Peter ii. 10.) make them also <I>not afraid to bring in sects of perdition, blaspheming,</I> and this in civil government
                           as well as ecclesiastical. Those that call themselves Reformers, in the beginning of the 16th century, of all others were
                           remarkable in this. What bloody tumults and wars were there not produced in Germany, by the first Reformers in that country!
                           Calvin overturned the government of Geneva; and his followers, under the name Hugonots, filled France for a great length of
                           time with slaughter and civil wars, frequently shaking the throne itself. In this country, the first cause of its separation
                           from the universal Church, was the unbridled passion of a tyrant: the effects were adultery, and the murder of the successive
                           queens that he had taken to his adulterous bed. In the reign of his successor, the insatiate avarice of a corrupt nobility,
                           gratified with the sacrilegious plunder of the Church, established what is called the Reformation. The fear of being compelled
                           to disgorge the fruits of their rapine, contributed much to the confirmation of that order of things in the reign of Elizabeth.
                           She was inclined to it by the circumstances of her birth, which could not be legitimate, if her father's marriage with Catharine
                           of Arragon was valid, as the first authority in the Catholic Church had declared. The natural spirit of this heresy, though
                           checked a while and kept under by the despotical government of this queen, appeared in its own colours soon after, and produced
                           its natural fruits in the turbulence of the times that succeeded, and the multiplicity of sects that are continually springing
                           up to this very day. --- As the true Church is holy, recommending various exercises of religion tending to purify human nature,
                           and render men holy, as fasting, confession of sins, evangelical counsels, &amp;c. so false teachers cast off all these, <I>promising
                           liberty,</I> (2 Peter ii. 16.[19.?]) and giving full rein to the lustful passions, thus giving a liberty of living, as well
                           as a liberty of believing. --- Another fruit of false teachers is, separation from what was the Universal Church before their
                           time, and which continues to be still the far greater part, not being confined to one state or country. If some modern principles,
                           of not allowing any communion of religion out of each state, were admitted, as many religions should have been established
                           by heaven as men think proper to establish different states; nor could Christ have given one for all mankind, under whatever
                           state or form of government they might live. --- Finally, false teachers are to known by their not being able to shew, that
                           they have received their doctrine and mission from the apostles, in a regular succession from them. Some of our modern divines
                           would spurn at the idea of holding their doctrine and orders from the Catholic Church, such as it existed at the time of the
                           Reformation, which is precisely such as it exists at the present moment. --- In answer to this it has been retorted, that
                           the fruits of the Catholic religion have been as bad, or worse; and the horrors of the French revolution are particularly
                           mentioned, as a proof. ... That great crimes have been committed by those who professed themselves Catholics, is not denied;
                           but that they were prompted to them by the nature of their religion, is certainly not admitted. The revolution of France in
                           particular, was the effect of the people falling off from their religion. As well may the Puritans, that brought Charles to
                           the block, be said to be Catholics, because they or their parents once had been such: as well may the present bench of Protestant
                           bishops be said to be Catholics, because the bishops of their sees once were so; or that Robespierre, Marat, and the Jacobins
                           that persecuted catholicity in France, and brought its too indulgent sovereigns to the guillotine, were Catholics, or directed
                           in the least by Catholic principles. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           is bestowed on men not for their own good, but for the advantage of others. We must not then be surprised if men, who had
                           indeed faith in Christ, but whose lives did not correspond with their faith, should be honoured with these extraordinary gifts,
                           since the Almighty sometimes employs as his instruments in working similar wonders, men destitute both of faith and virtue.
                           Balaam, void of faith and probity, still by the will of God, prophesied for the advantage of others. To Pharao and Nabuchodonosor
                           were revealed future events of the greatest moment; and the wicked Judas himself cast out devils. Therefore St. Paul said,

                           of Christ to the account of his miracles; for we cannot doubt that the discourse on the mount, which is mentioned by St. Matthew,
                           is the same as that recorded by St. Luke. The beginning, the middle, and the conclusion correspond with each other. If St.
                           Matthew mentions some particulars omitted by St. Luke, it is because his design was to collect together several instructions,
                           which Jesus delivered on different occasions; and these, for the most part, are to be found in other parts of St. Luke. ---
                           This admirable sermon may be divided into three parts, viz. the exordium, the body of the discourse, and the conclusion. The
                           exordium comprises the eight beatitudes, and merits our most serious attention. The body of the discourse is chiefly addressed
                           to the apostles, whom Jesus had recently chosen, in order to instil into them, and all succeeding pastors of the Church, a
                           right sense of the great duties belonging to their ministry; and, in the second place, it refers to all the faithful in general.
                           The conclusion consists of an exhortation to a life of piety, and contains several advices, some of which chiefly regard pastors,
                           others indiscriminately all the faithful in general. --- May this excellent abridgment of thy doctrine, O Jesus! be the rule
                           of our manners, the pattern of our life. Amen. (Haydock)</FONT></P>
