                           to make the reflections against Providence which are set down in the following verses. (Challoner) --- Protestants, "his people
                           return hither, and waters of a full <i>cup</i> are wrung out for them." St. Jerome saw nothing of waters. "And who among them
                           shall be found full?" He also reads <i>my</i> people (Haydock) better. It is difficult to understand the present Hebrew: whereas
                           the Septuagint is plain; as they found <i>imi, days,</i> instead of <i>ume,</i> "and who," or "and waters." (Berthier) ---
                           We may explain this of the sentiments which the captives should entertain (Calmet) at their return. (Theodoret) --- Asaph,
                           seeing the impiety of the Babylonians, concluded that they would surely be punished, and Israel, being converted, would be
                           put again in possession of their delightful country. (Calmet) --- The prosperity of the former will cause some to fall away,
                           and their days will be full of misery, (Worthington) or they will ponder whole days on these things. (Berthier)</font></p><b>

                           were lifted up." Do the rich think, that their prosperity may be an effect of God's indignation? (Calmet) --- We are here

                                    <p>1 A psalm for Asaph.</p>
                                    <p>How good is God to Israel, to them that are of a right heart!</p>
                                    <p>2 But my feet were almost moved; my steps had well nigh slipt.</p>
                                    <p>3 Because I had&nbsp;zeal on occasion of the wicked, seeing the prosperity of sinners.</p>
                                    <p>4 For there is no regard to their death, nor <i>is there</i> strength in their stripes.</p>
                                    <p>5 They are not in the labour of men: neither shall they be scourged like <i>other </i>men.</p>
                                    <p>6 Therefore pride hath held them fast: they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness.</p>
                                    <p>7 Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were, from fatness: they have passed into the affection of the heart.</p>
                                    <p>8 They have thought and spoken wickedness: they have spoken iniquity on high.</p>
                                    <p>9 They have set their mouth against heaven: and their tongue hath passed through the earth.</p>
                                    <p>10 Therefore will my people return here: and full days shall be found in them.</p>
                                    <p>11 And they said: How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?</p>
                                    <p>12 Behold these are sinners; and <i>yet </i>abounding in the world they have obtained riches.</p>
                                    <p>13 And I said: Then have I in vain justified my heart, and washed my hands among the innocent.</p>
                                    <p>14 And I have been scourged all the day; and my chastisement hath been in the mornings.</p>
                                    <p>15 If I said: I will speak thus; behold I should condemn the generation of thy children.</p>
                                    <p>16 I studied that I might know this thing, it is a labour in my sight:</p>
                                    <p>17 Until I go into the sanctuary of God, and understand concerning their last ends.</p>
                                    <p>18 But indeed for deceits thou hast put it to them: when they were lifted up, thou hast cast them down.</p>
                                    <p>19 How are they brought to desolation? they have suddenly ceased to be: they have perished by reason of their iniquity.</p>
                                    <p>20 As the dream of them that awake, O Lord; <i>so </i>in thy city thou shalt bring their image to nothing.</p>
                                    <p>21 For my heart hath been inflamed, and my reins have been changed: 22 and I am brought to nothing, and I knew not.</p>
                                    <p>23 I am become as a beast before thee: and I <i>am </i>always with thee.</p>
                                    <p>24 Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou hast conducted me, and with glory thou hast received me.</p>
                                    <p>25 For what have I in heaven? and besides thee what do I desire upon earth?</p>
                                    <p>26 <i>For thee</i> my flesh and my heart have fainted away: thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion
                                    for ever.</p>
                                    <p>27 For behold they that go far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that are disloyal to thee.</p>
                                    <p>28 But it is good for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the Lord God:</p>
                                    <p>That I may declare all thy praises, in the gates of the daughter of Sion.</p></font></font>
