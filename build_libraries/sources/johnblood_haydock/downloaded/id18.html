                           Jesus Christ was led by the Holy Ghost, immediately after his baptism, into the desert,[1] to prepare, by fasting and prayer,
                           for his public ministry, and to merit for us by his victory over the enemy of our salvation, force to conquer him also ourselves.
                           By this conduct, he teaches all that were to be in future times called to his ministry, how they are to retire into solitude,
                           in order to converse with God in prayer, and draw down the blessing of heaven upon themselves and their undertaking. What
                           treasures of grace might we expect, if, as often as we receive any of the sacraments, we were to retire within ourselves,
                           and shut out, for a time, the world and its cares. Then should we come prepared to withstand temptation, and should experience
                           the divine assistance in every difficulty through life. The life of man is a warfare on earth. It was not given us, says St.
                           Hilary, to spend it in indolence, but to wage a continual war against our spiritual enemies. In the greatest sanctity there
                           are often the greatest and most incessant trials; for Satan wishes nothing so much as the fall of the saints. (Haydock) ---
                           By these trials, we learn the strength we have received from above, we are preserved from self-complacency and pride in the
                           gifts of heaven; we confirm the renunciation we made in baptism of the devil, and all his works and pomps; we become stronger,
                           and better prepared for future attacks, and are feelingly convinced of the dignity to which we have been raised, and of which
                           the enemy of souls endeavours all he can to deprive us. St. Chrysostom hom. xiii. Both St. John the Baptist and our divine
                           Master, by retiring into the wilderness for contemplation, prayer, fasting and suffering, have given a sanction and an example
                           to those holy men called hermits, who have taken shelter in their sanctified retreats against the dangers of the world. (Bristow)</FONT></P><B>

                           wished to manifest a certain corporeal weakness, arising from his continued fast, that the devil might venture to tempt him;
                           and after a fast of 40 days and 40 nights he was hungry. (Haydock) --- Christ was well acquainted with the thoughts of the
                           wicked fiend, and his great desire of tempting or trying him. The devil had learnt that he was come into the world from the
                           songs of the angels at his birth, and from the mouth of the shepherds and of St. John the Baptist. To fast 40 days without
                           being hungry, was certainly far above the strength of man, but to be hungry at any time is inconsistent with God; for which
                           reason our blessed Saviour, that he might not manifestly declare his divinity, was afterwards hungry. (St. Hilary) --- On
                           this example, as well as that of Moses and Elias, who also fasted 40 days, the fast of Lent was instituted by the apostles,
                           and is of necessity to be observed according to the general consent of the ancient Fathers. St. Jerome (ep. liv. ad Marcel.)
                           says, we fast 40 days, or make one Lent in a year, according to the tradition of the apostles. St. Augustine (serm. lxix.)
                           says, by the due observance of Lent, the wicked are separated from the good, infidels from Christians, heretics from Catholics.
                           Our Saviour fasted 40 days, not because he stood in need of it, as we do, to subject the unruly members of the body, which
                           lust against the spirit, but to set an example for our imitation. (Haydock) --- Another reason might be, to prevent the captious
                           remarks of the Jews, who might object that he had not yet done what the founder of their law, Moses, and after him Elias,
                           had done. (Palacius in Mat.)</FONT></P><B>

                           the tempter coming,"&nbsp;<I><U>O peirazon</U>,</I> who looked upon this hunger as a favourable moment to tempt him, and to
                           discover if he were truly the Son of God, as was declared at his baptism, desired Jesus to change by a miracle the stones
                           into bread, to appease his hunger and to recover his strength. (Haydock) --- By this we are taught, that amidst our greatest
                           austerities and fasts, we are never free from temptation. But if your fasts, says St. Gregory, do not free you entirely from
                           temptations, they will at least give you strength not to be overcome by them. (St. Thomas Aquinas.) The tempter is supposed
                           to have appeared in a human form, and the whole temptation to have been merely external, like that which took place with our
                           first parents in Paradise. It would have been beneath the perfection of Christ, to have allowed the devil the power of suggesting
                           wicked thoughts to his mind. (Jansenius. p. 107.) Had Jesus Christ converted the stones into bread, the devil, according to
                           St. Jerome, would have thence inferred that he was God. But it was Christ's intention to overcome the proud fiend rather by
                           humility than power. (St. Thomas Aquinas) Thus, if the first Adam fell from God by pride, the second Adam has effectually
                           taught us how to overcome the devil by humility. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           liveth not by bread only.</I> The words were spoken of the manna. (Deuteronomy viii. 3.) The sense in this place is, that
                           man's life may be supported by any thing, or in any manner, as it pleaseth God. (Witham) --- St. Gregory upon this passage
                           says: if our divine Redeemer, when tempted by the devil, answered in so mild a manner, when he could have buried the wicked
                           tempter in the bottom of hell, ought not man, when he suffers any thing from his fellow man, rather to improve it to his advantage,
                           than to resent it to his own ruin. Man consists of soul and body; his body is supported by bread, his soul by the word of
                           God; hence the saying, "Lex est cibus animæ." (Mat. Polus.)</FONT></P><B>

                           text of St. Luke this temptation is the third: but most commentators follow the order of St. Matthew. In Palestine, all buildings
                           had a flat roof, with a balustrade or a parapet. It was probably upon the parapet that the devil conveyed Jesus. The three
                           temptations comprise the three principal sources of sin: 1. sensuality; 2. pride; and 3. concupiscence. 1st epistle John ii.
                           16. We may hope to conquer the first by fasting and confidence in divine Providence; the second by humility; the third by
                           despising all sublunary things, as unworthy&nbsp;a Christian's solicitude. (Haydock) --- <I>the devil took him,</I> &amp;c.[2]
                           If we ask in what manner this was done, St. Gregory answers, that Christ might permit himself to be taken up, and transported
                           in the air by the devil, he that afterwards permitted himself to be tormented, and nailed to a cross by wicked men, who are
                           members of the devil. Others think the devil only conducted him from place to place. The text of St. Luke favours this exposition,
                           when it is said, the devil <I>led</I> him to Jerusalem, to a <I>high mountain,</I> &amp;c. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           says St. Augustine, quote Scriptures, as the devil does here, in a wrong and forced sense; the Church cites them, like Jesus
                           Christ, in their true sense, and to confute their falsehood. (Cont. lit. Petil. lib. ii. chap. 51.) It is on this account,
                           that the Catholic Church wishes persons who come to the study of the most mysterious and difficult book ever published, should
                           bring with them some preparation of mind and heart; convinced that the abuse of the strongest and best food may be converted
                           into deadly poison. The promoters of Bible societies have published in Ireland a tract to encourage the universal perusal
                           of the Scriptures, as the sole rule of faith. In this they give not only a mutilated and corrupt version of the letter of
                           his late Holiness Pius VI. to the now archbishop of Florence, (to be seen at the head of this edition of the Bible) but certain
                           letters from German Jansenists, who are described as being good Catholics. (Haydock)</FONT></P>

                           bearing repeated testimony of him and of his divine mission, as we read in the first chap. of St. John, and then retired into
                           Upper Galilee to avoid the fury of the Jews. There were two Galilees, that of the Jews and that of the Gentiles; this latter
                           was given by the king of Tyre to king Solomon. (St. Jerome) This conduct of Jesus Christ, shews that on some occasions it

                           the place assigned by the ancient prophets. The Pharisees had prevailed upon Herod to arrest the baptist, nor could their

                           be manifested, and the incredulous Jews be without excuse. If after the preaching of St. John, and his express testimony of
                           the divinity of our Redeemer, they could still say: thou givest testimony of thyself; thy testimony is not true: what would
                           they not have said, if, without any precursor, he had, all on a sudden, appeared amongst them. He did not begin to preach
                           till St. John was cast into prison, that the people might not be divided. On this account also St. John wrought no miracle,
                           that the people might be struck with the miracles of our Saviour, and yield their assent to him. (St. Chrysostom, hom. 14.)

                           of to exhort to repentance. The former menaced evil, and held out a promise of good, but the good or evil was temporal. St.
                           John begins his exhortations with the threat of eternal punishments---but Christ sweetens the hardships of penance by reminding

                           thus converting that into an argument against the doctrine of Jesus Christ, which of all other circumstances most solidly
                           and forcibly establishes its divinity and authority. (Salmeron. trac. 25.) --- If Christ had persuaded the ignorant apostles
                           only, there might be some room for such an argument. But if these 12 ignorant men triumphed over the learning, the eloquence,
                           the sophisms of the philosophers themselves, over the strong arm of power in the hands of tyrants, and finally over the devils

                           we may conclude, with St. Paul, that it was wisdom in God to choose the weak things of this world to confound the strong---the
