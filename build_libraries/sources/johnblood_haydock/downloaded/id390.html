                           not think women or children are comprised. The Jews satisfied the inquiry of Cestius, concerning the multitude which might
                           be assembled at the paschal solemnity, by allowing ten for every victim; and finding that 250,600 victims had been sacrificed
                           in the space of two hours, they concluded 2,700,000 people were collected at Jerusalem. (Josephus, Jewish Wars vii. 16.)</FONT></P><B>

                           (Theodoret) --- <I>A kid.</I> The <I>Phase</I> might be performed, either with a lamb or with a kid; and all the same rites
                           and ceremonies were to be used with the one as with the other. (Challoner) --- Many have asserted, that both were to be sacrificed.
                           But custom decides against them. All was to be perfect, <I>Momim,</I> as even the pagans required; (Grotius) and God (Leviticus
                           xxii. 22,) orders the victims in general must have no fault. The Egyptians rejected them, if they were even spotted, or twins.
                           --- <I>A male,</I> as all holocausts were to be. Pagans gave the preference to females. (Calmet) --- <I>One year,</I> not
                           older, though it would do if above eight days old. (Menochius) --- The paschal lamb prefigured Jesus Christ, who has redeemed
                           us by his death, being holy, set apart, and condescending to feed us with his sacred person, in the blessed Eucharist. Here
                           we eat the lamb without breaking a bone, though we take the whole victim. (John xix. 36; 1 Corinthians v. 7.) (Calmet) ---
                           To fulfil this figure, Christ substituted his own body, and, making his apostles priests, ordered them to continue this sacrifice
                           for ever. He came to Jerusalem on the 10th day of Nisan, on Sunday. He gave himself to his disciples on the evening of the
                           14th, and died at noon on the 15th. The unleavened bread, and the cup, (Luke xxii. 17,) clearly denoted the blessed Sacrament,
                           which was ordered to be eaten in the house or church of God. (St. Cyprian, Unit.) See St. Gregory, hom. 22, in Evang.; Tertullian,
                           contra Marc. iv, "The bread he made his own body." If, therefore, the truth must surpass the figure, surely the blessed Sacrament
                           must be more than bread and wine; otherwise it would yield in excellence and signification to the paschal lamb. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           hours. This time belonged to the evening of the 14th [of Nisan], at which time the lamb was to be sacrificed, though it was
                           to be eaten in the night, which pertained to the 15th. (Menochius) --- The Jews began the day at sun-set, and some began the
