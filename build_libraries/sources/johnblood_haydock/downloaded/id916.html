                           law without the books of Moses? (Haydock) --- The Samaritans have retained the Pentateuch in the Ph&#339;nician character,
                           while the Jews have insensibly adopted the Chaldee, during their captivity. On some occasions, these people have boasted of
                           their descent from the patriarchs, John iv. 12., and 20. But in times of danger, they have confessed their true origin. (Josephus,

                           Garizim was not then honoured with the temple, as the Samaritans would pretend. (Chronicles) They wished to join in building
                           that at Jerusalem, under Esdras. (Calmet) --- <I>Lord.</I> Collins would make us believe, that the Samaritans continued "for
                           a long time" without the Pentateuch, and all "heathens for many ages." But the first supposition "is to me incredible," says
                           Kennicott; and Hottinger himself allows, that the priests did bring back a copy of the law "exactly corresponding with the
                           autograph of Moses." (Exert. p. 8.) And as for the Samaritans being heathens, Prideaux, whom this infidel writer quotes, (Haydock)
                           says, "consistently with his Bible, that they continued in that gross idolatry of worshipping other gods <I>in conjunction
                           with the True;</I> which last words are very unfairly omitted." (Kennicott, Diss. ii. p. 115.) --- This was the true origin
                           and state of this mixture of nations, who were sent to cultivate the lands of Samaria. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           This impure service did not deserve a mitigation of the late chastisement. But God often punishes in this world (Haydock)

                           in the original text; and ver. 41 seems to require that we should understand it iin this manner, as the Cutheans could hardly
                           be blamed for neglecting a thing of which they had before no knowledge. The Israelites are justly blamed for obstinately continuing
                           in their prevarication, even in the midst of their captivity. The Syriac and Arabic translate, "The Israelites have been forced
                           to leave their country, because they have abandoned the Lord; and they have not obeyed his laws, his precepts, and his ordinances,
