                           hear thee graciously; as it is written in Deuteronomy, (see chap. iv. 29.; Haydock) and his prayer was thus heard by the Lord,
                           and he was delivered and brought back to his kingdom, like Habacuc." (St. Jerome, Trad.) --- The author of the imperfect work
                           on St. Matthew, (among the works of St. Chrysostom, hom. 1.; Haydock) says, that Manasses was barely allowed as much barley
                           bread, and water mixed with vinegar, as would keep him alive. Whereupon, remembering the Lord, he had recourse to his clemency,
                           and a miraculous flame surrounded him, and dissolving his chains, set him at liberty. Saos-duchin, the successor of Azarhaddon,
                           probably restored him to his throne, some years after his captivity, or perhaps that very year, so that his repentance continued
