                           understand it of such as are truly in poverty and want, and who bear their indigent condition with patience and resignation.
                           (Witham) --- That is, the humble; and they whose spirit is not set upon riches. (Challoner) --- It is not without reason that
                           the beatitudes are disposed of in this order. Each preceding one prepares the way for what immediately follows, furnishing
                           us in particular with spiritual arms of such graces as are necessary for obtaining the virtue of the subsequent beatitude.
                           Thus the poor in spirit, i.e. the truly humble, will mourn for their transgressions, and whoever is filled with sorrow and
                           confusion for his own sins, cannot but be just, and behave to others with meekness and clemency; when possessed of these virtues,
                           he then becomes pure and clean of heart. Peace of conscience reigns in this assemblage of virtues, and cannot be expelled
                           the soul by any tribulations, persecutions, or injustices of men. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xv.) What is this poverty of spirit,
                           but humility and contrition? This virtue of humility is placed in the first place, because it is the parent of every other
                           virtue, as pride is the mother of every vice. Pride deprived our first parents of their original innocence, and nothing but
                           humility can restore us to our former purity. We may pray and fast, we may be possessed of mercy, chastity, or any virtues,
                           if humility do not accompany them, they will be like the virtue of the Pharisee, without foundation, without fruit. (Hom.
                           xv.)</FONT></P><B>

                           in psalm xxxvi, had made the same promise to the meek. If temporal blessings are promised to some of the virtues in the beatitudes,
                           it is that temporal blessings might always accompany the more solid rewards of grace. But spiritual rewards are always the
                           principal, always ranked in the first place, all who practice these virtues are pronounced blessed. (Hom. xv.)</FONT></P><B>

                           St. Augustine they cannot suffer for justice, who have divided the Church; and where sound faith or charity is wanting, there
                           cannot be justice. (Cont. epis. Parm. lib. i. chap. 9. ep. 50. ps. 4. conc. 2.) (Bristow) --- By justice here we understand
                           virtue, piety, and the defence of our neighbour. To all who suffer on this account, he promises a seat in his heavenly kingdom.
                           We must not think that suffering persecution only, will suffice to entitle us to the greatest promises. The persecutions we
                           suffer must be inflicted on us on <I>his</I> account, and the evils spoken of us must be false and contradicted by our lives.

                           meant to preserve men from the corruption of sin, and to make them relish the truths of salvation. He tells them not to suffer
                           their faith or their charity to slacken, in which all their power consists, lest they come to be rejected by God, and despised
                           by man. (Calmet) --- I send you, says Jesus Christ, not to two, ten, or twenty cities, not to one single nation, as the prophets
                           were sent, but to the whole world, a world oppressed with numberless iniquities. It is not the property of salt to restore
                           what is already corrupted, but to preserve from corruption. Therefore the virtue of the merits of Christ delivers us from
                           the corruption of sin; but the care and labour of the apostles preserves us from again returning to it. (St. Chrysostom, hom.
                           xv.) --- It appears from Luke xiv. 34, that this comparison is taken from agriculture. We observe these properties of salt
                           in the different manures that fertilize the soil, but suffer the salts to evaporate, and all their virtue is lost. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Our Saviour speaks in this manner, to prepare the minds of the Jews for his new instructions. For although they were not very
                           solicitous about fulfilling the law, still they were extremely jealous of any change being made in the letter of the law;
                           more particularly, if the proposed change exacted a more perfect morality. Our Lord fulfilled the law three several ways:
                           1. By his obedience to the prescribed rites; therefore he says, it behoveth us to fulfil all justice: and who shall accuse
                           me of sin? 2. He observes the law, not only by his own observance of it, but likewise by enabling us to fulfil it. It was
                           the wish of the law to make man just, but found itself too weak; Christ therefore came justifying man, and accomplished the
                           will of the law. 3. He fulfilled the law, by reducing all the precepts of the old law to a more strict and powerful morality.
