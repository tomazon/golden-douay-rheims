                           is all very uncertain. The man seems to have gotten possession of the marks of the royal dignity in the night, as the Philistines

                           <I>Head.</I> None but thyself can be answerable for thy death. See Matthew xxvii. 25. David was already supreme magistrate,
                           and he wished that all should be convinced that he rejoiced not at the death of the king, and that none might imitate the
                           example of this wretch. (Calmet) --- Thus Vitellius punished the murderers of Galba, "not out of respect to Galba; but, according
                           to the custom of princes, as a protection for the present, and a threat of vengeance for the future," in case any should dare
                           to treat him in like manner. (Tacitus i.) <I>Tradito principibus more, munimentum in præsens, in posterum ultionem.</P></I></FONT></FONT><B>

                           So this canticle was entitled, because it spoke in praise of the bow and arrows of Saul and Jonathan, ver. 22. So one of the
                           works of Hesiod is called "a buckler;" of Theocritus "a flute;" of Simmias "a wing;" &amp;c. Septuagint have neglected this
                           word entirely (Calmet) in the Roman edition. But it is found in the Alexandrian copy, which reads "Israel," instead of <I>Juda,</I>
                           perhaps properly. (Grabe, prol. iv. 2.) (Haydock) --- Chaldean, "to shoot with the bow." Many suppose that David cautioned
                           his men to exert themselves in that art, (Menochius) as they might soon expect to have to encounter the Philistines, (Tirinus)
                           who were very expert bowmen. (Worthington) --- But the former interpretation seems preferable. (Calmet) --- The bow might
                           be also the beginning of some favourite song, to the tune of which (Du Hamel) David would have his men to sing this canticle,
                           (Haydock) particularly when they went to battle. (Grotius) --- <I>Just.</I> See Josue x. 3. (Menochius) --- It seems this
                           was a more ancient record, to which the author of this book refers. (Calmet) --- He might have in view the canticle of Anna,
                           (1 Kings ii. 4,) or some other. (Haydock) --- The custom of composing canticles, on such solemn occasions, is very ancient
                           and frequent. See 3 Kings iii. 33., and xiii. 29., and Jeremias xlviii. 31. (Homer, Iliad <I><U>ps</U></I> &amp; <I><U>ch</U></I>)
                           The style of this piece can hardly be equalled by the most polite writers. (Calmet) --- David is chiefly occupied with the
                           praises of Jonathan. (Haydock) --- <I>Consider....places.</I> This sentence is omitted in Hebrew, Chaldean, Septuagint, and
                           in some copies of St. Jerome's version. (T. i. p. 365, Nov. edit. op.) It is a farther explication of the subsequent verse.
                           (Calmet) --- Yet the Septuagint read, "Erect a pillar, O Israel, [upon thy heights; the Vatican Septuagint places this after
                           <I>slain.</I> (Haydock)] in honour of the slain, thy wounded <I>soldiers.</I> How are the mighty fallen?" The Hebrew seems
                           to be different from what the Septuagint, Chaldean, &amp;c., read, as the Masora now adopts <I>etsbi,</I> instead of <I>etsib,</I>
                           which has greatly puzzled interpreters. Hence Aquila translates&nbsp;<I><U>akriboson</U>,</I> with the Septuagint of Ximenes,
                           i.e., "Execute <I>or</I> consider with attention," this sepulchral monument on which you shall inscribe, "For the dead <I>and</I>
                           for thy wounded." It was to be placed on some "eminence," according to custom. The present Hebrew is very indeterminate, denoting
                           "glory, a honey-comb," &amp;c., Ezechiel xx. 6., and Daniel xi. 16, 41. See Grabe, Prol. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew, "the glory (beauty, hart, &amp;c.) of Israel hath been pierced," &amp;c. The comparison of Saul with a hart, is noble
                           enough in the ideas of the ancients, Psalm xvii. 34., Canticle of Canticles ii. 9., and viii. 14. Syriac and Arabic, "O hart
                           of Israel, they have been slain," &amp;c. (Calmet) --- <I>Slain.</I> Hebrew <I>chalal,</I> signifies also "a soldier;" and
                           this word agrees perfectly well with <I>giborim,</I> "valiant," both here and ver. 22 and 25. Kennicott would apply it to
                           Jonathan, upon whom David's attention is mostly fixed. "O ornament of Israel! O warrior, upon thy high places! <I>How,</I>"

                           which may be offered to the Lord. Inanimate things could not offend, nor does David curse them in earnest. But (Tirinus) nothing
                           could more strikingly express his distress and grief, than this imprecation. It is false that those mountains have since been
                           barren. This canton is one of the most fruitful of the country. (Brochard.) (Calmet) --- Job (iii.) speaks with the same animation,
                           and curses his day. (Menochius) --- <I>Of Saul,</I> or "Saul, the shield of his people, was cast away, as," &amp;c. Protestants,

                           (Tacitus, mor. Germ) --- A woman of Sparta told her son, when she delivered one to him, "Bring this back, or be brought upon
                           it" dead. <I>Impositu scuto referunt Pallanta frequentes.</I> (Virgil, Æneid x.) (Sanctius) (Calmet) --- <I>As though.</I>

                           instead of <I>cli,</I> (Delany) as the former word seems no where else to signify <I>quasi non;</I> and the Syriac, Arabic,
                           and Chaldean omit the negation. It might therefore be <I>the shield of Saul,</I> "the arms of him who has been anointed with
                           oil." (Kennicott) --- Some would refer this unction to the shield, (Vatable) as this was some times done: (Menochius) but
                           the reflection would be here too trifling. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           or united. Jonathan always behaved with due respect towards his father, though he could not enter into his unjust animosity
                           against David. (Calmet) --- The latter passes over in silence all that Saul had done against himself, and seems wholly occupied
                           with the thought of the valour and great achievements of the deceased. (Haydock) --- Sanchez believes that these epithets
                           were introduced of course into funeral canticles, like <I>Alas! my noble one,</I> (Jeremias xxii. 18.; Menochius) as Saul
                           could have no pretensions to be styled lovely, or friendly, towards the latter part of his reign; since he treated the priests,
                           David, and even his son Jonathan, with contumely, and even with unrelenting fury. But all this David would willingly bury
                           in oblivion. He will not even notice how different was the end of the two heroes. Jonathan died like a virtuous soldier in
                           his country's cause; Saul was wounded, but impiously accelerated his own death, through dread of torments and of insult. Though
                           they died, therefore, on the same field of battle, their end was as different as that of the saint and of the impenitent sinner.

                           --- No character could be more worthy of praise than the latter. His breast was never agitated by envy, though he seemed to
                           be the most interested to destroy David. Even Saul had many excellent qualities; which makes Ven. Bede compare him in those
                           respects with Jesus Christ; as most of the memorable persons and events of the Old Testament had a view to Christ on the one
                           hand, and to the Synagogue on the other. Saul is one of the most striking figures of the reprobation and conduct of the Jewish
                           church. As he was adorned with many glorious prerogatives, and chosen by God, yet he no sooner beheld the rising merit of
                           David, than he began to persecute him: so the Jews had been instructed by the prophets, and had been selected as God's peculiar
                           inheritance; and nevertheless took occasion from the virtues and miracles of the Son of God, to conspire his ruin. The Romans
                           were sent to punish the Jews, who are now become the most abject of all mankind, and are filled with rage, seeing the exaltation
                           of the Christian Church, as Saul was reduced by the Philistines to the greatest distress, and his children were forced to
                           implore the protection of the man whom he had so cruelly persecuted, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- Saul and Judas may be a warning
                           to us, that no person ought to live without fear, since they perished so miserably, though they had been elevated by the hand
                           of God. (St. Ambrose, &amp;c.) (Haydock)</FONT></P><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>
