                           Timothy, it appears, had been sent to Corinth to confirm the faithful in the doctrine which they had received from St. Paul.
                           After he had fulfilled this commission, he returned to St. Paul, and gave him an account how they had behaved, and what good
                           effects his first letter had produced. He styles him brother, to conciliate to him the esteem and respect of the Corinthians.
                           This epistle is not merely addressed to the Corinthians, but to all Achaia, of which Corinth was the capital. (Estius) ---
                           Others think that Timothy had left Corinth before St. Paul's first epistle had arrived thither; and that this determined St.
                           Paul to send Titus with another disciple thither. See 2 Corinthians xii. 18. From him St. Paul had the consolation to learn
                           the happy effects produced by his first letter. See 2 Corinthians vi. 7. 11.</FONT></P><B>

                           letter had afflicted them exceedingly; here he comforts them by telling them that God had filled him with consolation in order
                           to comfort them. The Greek rather signifies, by the consolation with which we are comforted. Either explanation is sufficiently
                           clear, though the latter is stronger. We may here remark the great tenderness St. Paul had for the Corinthians, since he here
                           insinuates that he had received comfort from God merely to communicate it to them. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Paul here styles his own sufferings, the suffering of Christ, to shew that Christ takes part, and suffers in all his members.
                           (St. Chrysostom) --- Though it is generally understood to signify the sufferings undergone for Christ. (Estius) --- If we
                           consider the very intimate union that exists between Jesus Christ, who is the head, and every one of the living members of
                           his body, that is, the Church, that whatever any one suffers, for the cause of truth, Christ is said to suffer, as the Lord
                           said to Saul, why persecutest thou me? and that whatever is given to any indigent brother in the name of a disciple, Christ
                           receives as given to himself, can we want any further proof of the excellence and power of good works, which begin and terminate

                           to us for your instruction, and that you may be <I>exhorted,</I> or <I>comforted</I> by our example. This is also signified

                           comfort when the faithful are in affliction, to see their pastors preaching and planting the faith of Christ, in the midst
                           of afflictions and persecutions. This gives them the greatest courage to bear patiently all adversity, being convinced after

                           of escaping even with our life. We were in daily expectation of death; like the criminal, who has been condemned to death,
                           we had no hopes of escaping, but we trusted in God, who has delivered us from all danger, by your intercession, ver. 11. He
                           alludes to the tumult raised at Ephesus, and other afflictions which befell him on that account, which, though not mentioned
                           in the Acts, (Acts xix. 24[29?], &amp;c.) were of such a&nbsp;nature as to make him weary of life. (St. Chrysostom)</FONT></P><B>

                           Therefore the sense must be, that God must now be thanked by many persons for the benefit in preserving my life, and hearing
                           the prayers of many persons, who before had prayed for my life. (Witham) --- St. Paul in soliciting the prayers of the Corinthians,
                           did not suppose that this was derogatory to Christ's mediation, nor to the hope he had in God. And can it be more dishonourable
                           to God to solicit the aid of saints in heaven than of sinners on earth? Or is it to be supposed, asks St. Jerome, that the
                           intercession of our fellow-men beneath, is more available with God, than the prayers of those, who enjoy the beatific vision

                           of this world, like those false doctors, whose whole design was to insinuate themselves into the affections of the Corinthians
                           by speaking what they knew would be agreeable to them. (Estius) --- He declares that the subject of his glory was, the testimony

                           doctrine which the apostle delivered to them was not ambiguous, doubtful, or contradictory, first one thing, then another;
                           on the contrary, it was such, that the apostle could say, (ver. 14.) we are your glory. --- <I>Amen.</I> All the promises
                           made by God, with regard to Christ, are fulfilled in him; therefore we may say Amen, and give glory to God, through Jesus
