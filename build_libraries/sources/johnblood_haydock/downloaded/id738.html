                           <i>Fool:</i> the man of the most depraved morals, the atheist and deist. There have always been (Berthier) such pests of society.
                           (Haydock) --- David has refuted them again, Psalm lii. (Berthier) --- Some have imagined that this psalm was composed in consequence
                           of the blasphemies of Rabsaces, (4 Kings xviii. 32.; Theodoret, &amp;c.) or of the Babylonians. (Calmet) --- The Fathers explain
                           it of Jesus Christ, denied by the Jews, &amp;c. --- <i>Heart.</i> This must be strangely corrupted, before the mouth can utter
                           such impiety. (Haydock) --- <i>No God.</i> Chaldean, "no power of God on earth." <i>Elohim</i> denotes particularly "judges."
                           There have been a few philosophers who have denied the existence of God; and more who have called in question his Providence:
                           though this amounts to the same thing. But the number of those who confess God with the mouth, and deny him by their works,
                           is immense. (Haydock) --- These live as if there were no judge. (Calmet) --- By sin they come at last to think there is none
                           to govern the world. (Worthington) --- Plato (Leg. 10.) acknowledged that three sorts of people offend God; those who deny
                           him; who say that He does not mind human affairs; or those who think that presents may prevail on him to connive at their
                           wickedness. It is doubtful whether the mind can ever be so darkened as to believe that there is no God. (Berthier) --- The
                           <i>heart</i> may wish there were none to punish its impiety. (Haydock) --- Libertinage or pride gives birth to so many infidels.
                           They have begun by reducing conscience to silence. Their arguments only tend to destroy. --- <i>No, not one,</i> is not in
                           Hebrew, Septuagint, &amp;c., except in ver. 3. (Calmet) --- Yet it occurs in the Vatican Septuagint, which is the best. (Berthier)
                           (Calmet) --- "They are become abominable, with earnestness there is none who doth good." (St. Jerome) (Haydock) --- Or they
                           sin designedly and with affectation. (Calmet) --- All are unable to do good without the Redeemer. (Worthington) --- Some explain
                           this of mankind in general, as all are born in sin. David refers also to actual and habitual sinners. (Berthier) --- St. Paul
                           (Romans iii.) proves from this text, and Isaias lix. 7, that all stand in need of grace and faith, and cannot be saved either
                           by the law of nature or of Moses. But it does not follow that faith alone will save, or that the most just are still wicked,
                           as Calvin and Beza falsely expound the Scriptures. For the prophets speak of those who were not yet justified, teaching that
                           all mankind were once in sin, and could not be justified but by Christ. At the same time, they assert that, when they are
                           justified, they must serve justice to bear fruit, and obtain happiness, Romans vi. These points are well explained by St.
                           Augustine: (de Sp. et lit. i. 9.) "The just are justified freely by his grace," not by the law or will; though this is not
                           effected without the will, &amp;c. The same holy doctor (c. 27) observes, that the just do not live free from all venial sins,
                           and yet remain in the state of salvation; while the wicked continue in the state of damnation, though they do some good works.

                           <i>God.</i> Those only who seek God, understand their real interests. (Haydock) --- The pagans, and particularly those of
                           Babylon, lived in the greatest dissolution, so as to call loudly for vengeance, ver. 5. (Calmet) --- Both the understanding

                           <i>Unprofitable.</i> Without faith in Christ, none have meritorious works. (Worthington) --- <i>Not one.</i> Such was the
                           condition of the world before Christ, as all were born in sin. "No one," says St. Augustine, "can do good, except he shew
                           the method." All were immersed in ruin, "except the holy Virgin, concerning whom, for the honour of the Lord, I would have
                           no question at all, in treating of sins." (St. Augustine, de Nat. et Grat. contra Pelag. xxxvii. 44.) (Calmet) --- The Council
                           of Trent approves of this reserve, when speaking of original sin. Our Saviour is the source of this privilege, and much more
                           out of the question. He could not be guilty of any sort of transgression. He was in <i>all things like</i> to us, <i>excepting
                           sin.</i> (Haydock) --- <i>Their,</i> &amp;c. What follows to <i>shall not,</i> (ver. 4.) occurs in St. Paul; (Romans iii.
                           11, 12, 13.) whence St. Jerome supposes that it has been inserted here, though the apostle took the quotations from different
                           parts of scripture. (Praef. in xvi. Isaias.) He informs us, that all the Greek commentators marked it as not found in Hebrew
                           or the Septuagint, "except in the Vulgate or <i><u>koine</u>,</i> which varied in different parts of the world." There seems
                           to be no reason why it should have been omitted designedly, whereas some might insert it, through the false notion that St.
                           Paul had taken it from this psalm. (Calmet) --- The Hebrew is not therefore mutilated, but the Vulgate redundant. (Amama)
                           --- Yet this is not absolutely clear. We find the quotation in the Roman Septuagint which is the most correct; (Berthier)
                           though some prefer the Alexandrian manuscripts. (Haydock) --- It is also in the Arabic and Ethiopic versions; so that it might
                           have been in St. Paul's copy. Our Saviour read a passage from Isaias, which is not extant, Luke iv. 19. (Berthier) --- St.
                           Justin Martyr, St. Augustine, &amp;c., agree with the Vulgate; and Lindan mentions a Hebrew copy which had these verses, though
                           the learned have reason to think that this Hebrew was of a modern date. (Calmet) --- Protestants, 1577, inserted these three
                           verses, (Worthington) which they now omit. --- <i>Sepulchre.</i> They are never satisfied with destruction, (Haydock) and
                           with vexing others. (Worthington) --- We bear in ourselves the seed of corruption, which can be prevented from growing up
                           only by the grace of Jesus Christ. (Berthier) --- Perdition is from thyself, O Israel. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           --- It is in Psalm lii. 6, and this renders the former omission (ver. 3.) more credible. (Berthier) --- When Cyrus approached
                           to besiege Babylon, Nabonides, the king, met him, and gave him battle; but losing the victory, he, in a panic, retreated to
                           Borsippe, and abandoned the defence of his capital. (Beros. apud Jos. con. Ap. 1.[Josephus, contra Apion i.?]) The citizens
                           were in the utmost consternation, Isaias xiii., and xxi., &amp;c. (Calmet) --- But the wicked tremble at the prospect of temporal
                           losses, (Menochius) and at shadows, while they boldly affront the Deity. Unbelievers find difficulties in the Catholic doctrines,
                           which are frequently attributed to their own mistakes. (Haydock) --- The pagans would not believe in God, but trembled before
                           idols; which cannot hurt the faithful. (Worthington)</font></p>

                                    <P>1 Unto the end, a psalm for David.</P>
                                    <P>The fool hath said in his heart: *There is no God.</P>
                                    <P>They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their ways: there is none that doth good, no not one.</P>
                                    <P>2 The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God.</P>
                                    <P>3 They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good: no not one.</P>
                                    <P>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully: the poison of asps <I>is </I>under their
                                    lips.</P>
                                    <P>Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood.</P>
                                    <P>Destruction and unhappiness in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their
                                    eyes.</P>
                                    <P>4 Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people as they eat bread?</P>
                                    <P>5 They have not called upon the Lord: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.</P>
                                    <P>6 For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man; but the Lord is his hope.</P>
                                    <P>7 Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people,
                                    Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</P></FONT></FONT>
