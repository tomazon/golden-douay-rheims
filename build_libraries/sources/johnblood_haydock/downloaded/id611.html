                           <i>There.</i> Hebrew, Septuagint, &amp;c., "And there," &amp;c. The books of Scripture are thus frequently connected. The
                           authors present us with a series of events, without prefixing any title, or their own names, that our attention may be wholly
                           fixed on what we read. The birth of Samuel being so miraculous, deserves to be recorded, as he was the last judge of Israel,
                           and had so much to do under the first of their kings, whose election and misconduct brought a great change into the state
                           of the commonwealth. (Calmet) --- <i>Ramathaimsophim.</i> Rama, or Ramatha, "a height," and the environs were occupied by
                           the family of Suph, a descendant of Core; (1 Paralipomenon vi. 29.) though the place did not properly belong to the Levites.
                           It lay probably between Gabaa and Bethel, where Samuel spent much of his time, while he was judge, and obliged to be frequently
                           absent from the tabernacle. (Calmet) --- Ragusinus and Prince Radzivil think it was afterwards called Arimathea, the birth-place
                           of Joseph, and now Ramula. (Tirinus) (Chap. ii. 11.) --- <i>Ephraimite.</i> He was of the tribe of Levi, (1 Paraliponmenon
                           vi. 34.) but is called an Ephraimites from dwelling in Mount Ephraim. (Challoner) --- So we read of Cretan Jews, Acts ii.
                           11. (Tirinus)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Phenenna.</i> She was only of inferior dignity. At that time polygamy was lawful, (Menochius) as Moses insinuates, if he

                           --- This title has not appeared in the former books. The pagans took occasion from it to form their <i>Jupiter Sabazius.</i>
                           (Calmet) --- Elcana might go up from the height of Ramatha to Silo, which was the highest mountain round Jerusalem of all
                           in the holy land. (Adrichom.) (Tirinus)</font></p><b>

                           him. Chaldean and many others translate, "a chosen:" (Calmet) Protestants, "a worthy portion." (Haydock) --- The shew-bread
                           is called, "the bread of the face," because it stood before the Lord. Joseph sent to each of his brethren, "a portion of his
                           faces," as the Hebrew expresses it; (Genesis xliii. 33.) or of such meat as was placed upon his table. In the East, the master
                           of a family has all set before him, and he sends to each his portion, to the place where he is sitting. (Chardin, Perse.)
                           --- Thus Elcana sent some more excellent, or "double," part to his beloved Anna, (Calmet) grieving inwardly that she had no
                           children, to whom he might also send. (Haydock) --- By this distinction, he wished to alleviate the sorrow of his wife. (Menochius)
                           --- <i>Womb.</i> Sterility was deemed a curse, and a mark of God's displeasure, with which women were often reproached. Hence
                           Anna prays so earnestly that God would be mindful of her, ver. 11-19. The power of the Almighty, in giving children to the
                           barren, is frequently mentioned, Genesis xxviii. 13., and Psalm cxii. 9. (Calmet) --- Luke i. 25., &amp;c. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           It is also called the temple, or the house of God, though it was only a tent, Matthew xii. 4., &amp;c. Perhaps women were

                           Samuel was bound to serve the tabernacle from 25 or 30 years of age till he was 50, Numbers iv. 2. Anna consecrates him to
                           the Lord for life, and promises that he shall be a Nazarite, like Samson, and St. John the Baptist. The law prescribes no
                           rules for these perpetual Nazarites, Numbers vi. 3. Many of the ancients believe that Samuel always observed the prescriptions
                           of Moses, and abstained from intoxicating liquors; though the Hebrew and Vulgate are silent on this head. We find that during
                           his administration as Judge, he was not able to continue always near the tabernacle. (Calmet) --- When he came to years of
                           discretion, he might depart if he thought proper, like other Levites. Had he been of another tribe, he must have been redeemed.
                           (Worthington) --- Esther, Elcana, or Samuel, might have annulled this vow. (Salien, the year of the world 2900.)</font></p><b>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Anna answering, said: Not so, my lord: for I am an exceeding unhappy

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Then Heli said to her: Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee
