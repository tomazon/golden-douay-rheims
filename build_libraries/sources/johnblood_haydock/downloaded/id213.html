                           They also denied that Christ was God. (Tirinus) --- May not this advice be at present applicable to many of our Christian

                           religion, and they who had been Jews, and were for making them retain those rites and customs which the Jews had among them,
                           and were only from their private human traditions. (Witham) This alludes to the traditions and observances which the Pharisees
                           had added to the law of Moses, and which Christ had blamed; but which these false apostles wished to introduce amongst the
                           Colossians. The ceremonial laws were the elementary instructions given by God to the world, but we are to attach ourselves
                           to the doctrines of Jesus Christ, from whom alone we expect light and justice, and sanctity. (Bible de Vence) --- <I>According
                           to the rudiments of the world:</I> by which some expound vain fallacies and false maxims of the first kind of teachers; others
                           the Jewish ceremonies, which are called <I>weak</I> and <I>poor elements,</I> or rudiments. (Galatians iv. 9.) This is neither
                           to condemn in general the use of philosophy, which St. Augustine commends, and made use of, nor all traditions delivered by
                           the apostles. See 1 Corinthians xi. and 2. Thessalonians ii. 14. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           the fasts and festivals observed in the Catholic Church; but it is evident, as St. Augustine observes, that the apostle is
                           here condemning the legal distinction of clean and unclean meats, and the feasts of the new moon, to which false brethren
                           wanted to subject the Colossians. (St. Augustine, ep. 59. ad Paulin. in solut. quæs. 7.)</FONT></P><B>

                           than Christ, our only Redeemer; walking in things you understand not, these men being deceived by their vain philosophy, and
                           pride of their own imaginations. By this means <I>not holding,</I> (ver. 19.) but having shaken off their only true invisible
                           head, Christ Jesus, who is the head of his Church. It is admitted that these false doctors, among the Colossians, had introduced
                           an undue and superstitious worship of Angels, and gave to them even a greater honour than to Christ. They worshipped them
                           as the creators of the world, as mediators with God, even above Jesus Christ, which St. Paul here expresseth by these words,
                           <I>not holding the head.</I> These seem to have been some disciples of Simon [the magician], and their heresies continued
                           in some churches of Asia even to the fourth age [fourth century A.D.], as we may find by a canon of the council of Laodicea.
                           But there is nothing here nor in that council against a due, i.e. an inferior honour and veneration, nothing like a divine
                           honour, nor injurious to Christ, our chief mediator and only Redeemer, which the Church, from the first ages [first centuries
                           A.D.], paid to saints and Angels. We do not ask grace, we do not offer up sacrifice, we hope not for salvation, but from God
                           only, from Christ, God and man. (Witham) --- <I>Willing,</I> &amp;c. That is, by a self-willed, self-invented, superstitious
                           worship, falsely pretending humility, but really proceeding from pride. Such was the worship that many of the philosophers
                           (against whom St. Paul speaks, ver. 8.) paid to Angels or demons, by sacrificing to them, as carriers of intelligence betwixt
                           God and man; pretending humility in so doing, as if God was too great to be addressed by men, and setting aside the mediatorship
                           of Jesus Christ; who is the head both of Angels and men. Such also was the worship paid by the ancient heretics, disciples
                           of Simon and Menander, to the Angels, whom they believed to be the makers and lords of this lower world. This is certain,
                           that they whom the apostle here condemns, did not <I>hold the head,</I> (ver. 19.) that is, Jesus Christ, and his mediatorship;
                           and therefore what he writes here no ways touches the Catholic doctrine and practice, of desiring our good Angels to pray
                           to God for us, through Jesus Christ. St. Jerome, (Epist. ad Algas) understands by the <I>religion</I> or service of <I>Angels,</I>
                           the Jewish religion given by Angels; and shews all that is here said to be directed against the Jewish teachers, who sought
                           to subject the new Christians to the observances of the Mosaic law. (Challoner) --- <I>Walking in the things which he hath
                           not seen.</I> These false teachers pretended to know the number and names of the Angels, and how to distribute them into different
                           orders and classes, with as much precision as if they had walked through heaven. Instead of following the revelation of the
                           holy Spirit in the gospel, they followed their own spirit, boasting of what it was impossible for them to know. (Calmet) ---
                           But let no one snatch from you the glory of heaven, which should be the reward of your career, and the recompense of your
                           fidelity, deceiving you by an outward show of false piety and affected humility. (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>
