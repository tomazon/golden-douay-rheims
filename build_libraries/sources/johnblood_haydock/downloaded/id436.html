                           at the tabernacle or temple of the Lord: to signify that no sacrifice would be acceptable to God, out of his true temple,

                           and goats, was to be poured out in honour of God by the priest, who received a part of each,&nbsp;Deuteronomy xviii. 3 and
                           xii. 15, 22. (Theodoret, q. 23.) Perhaps this law regards the time when the Hebrews sojourned in the desert; and that of Deuteronomy
                           has a reference to those times when they should obtain possession of Chanaan. (Calmet) --- We read of some private people,
                           like Manue and Elias, who offered sacrifice at a distance from the tabernacle. But this was done by a particular inspiration
                           of God, who dispensed with his own law. (St. Augustine, q. 56.) (3 Kings xviii. 23 and Judges xiii. 19.) (Menochius) See Josue

                           God forbids any sacrifice, but such as was performed by his priests at the tabernacle. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           was very abominable and obscene. (Strabo xvii.) (Calmet) --- Ezechiel (xvi. 22,) intimates, that the Hebrews were given to
                           idolatry in Egypt. They had also recently adored the calf. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>
