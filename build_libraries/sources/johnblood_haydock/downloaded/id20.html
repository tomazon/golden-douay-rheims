                           --- Hereby it is plain that good works are justice, and that man doing them doth justice, and is thereby just and justified,
                           and not by faith only. All which justice of a christian man, our Saviour here compriseth in the three eminent good works,
                           alms deeds, prayer, and fasting. (St. Augustine, lib. perf. just. chap. viii.) So that to give alms is to do justice, and
                           the works of mercy are justice. (St. Augustine, in Psalm xlix, ver. 5.) (Bristow) --- St. Gregory says, that the man who by
                           his virtuous actions would gain the applause of men, quits at an easy rate a treasure of immense value; for, with what he
                           might purchase the kingdom of heaven, he only seeks to acquire the transitory applause of mortals. This precept of Christ,
                           says St. Chrysostom, beautifully evinces the solicitude and unspeakable goodness of God, lest we should have the labour of
                           performing good works, and on account of evil motives be deprived of our reward. (Hom. xix.) "Shut up alms in the heart of
                           the poor." (Ecclesiasticus xxix. 15.)</font></p><b>

                           This must be understood figuratively, that we must avoid all ostentation in the performance of our good works. Many respectable
                           authors are of opinion, that it was customary with the Pharisees and other hypocrites, to assemble the poor they designed
                           to relieve by sound of trumpet. (Menochius) --- Let us avoid vain glory, the agreeable plunderer of our good works, the pleasant
                           enemy of our souls, which presents its poison to us under the appearance of honey. (St. Basil)</font></p><b>

                           be rewarded according to his works. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           This repaying or rewarding of good works, so often mentioned here by Jesus Christ, clearly evinces that good works are meritorious,

                           Hypocrisy is forbidden in all these three good works of justice, but not the doing of them openly for the glory of God, the
                           edification of our neighbour, and our own salvation. Let your light so shine before men, i.e. let your work be so done in
                           public, that the intention remain in secret. (St. Gregory)</font></p><b>

                           vain glory, might truly be said to pray in the street, and sound a trumpet before him: whilst he, who though he pray in public,
                           seeks not thence any vain glory, acts the same as if he prayed in his chamber. (Menochius) --- Jesus Christ went up to the

                           [<em>Speak not much</em>.[2] ] Long prayer is not here forbidden; for Christ himself spent whole nights in prayer: and he
                           sayeth, we must pray always; and the apostle, that we must pray without intermission, 1 Thessalonians v.; and the holy Church
                           hath had from the beginning her canonical hours for prayer, but rhetorical and elaborate prayer, as if we thought to persuade
                           God by our eloquence, is forbidden; the collects of the Church are most brief and most effectual. (St. Augustine, ep. 121.
                           chap. viii, ix, x.) (Bristow) --- Perseverance in prayer is recommended us by the example of the poor widow, who by her importunity
                           prevailed over the unjust judge. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xix.) --- The Greek word means, to babble or trifle.</font></p><b>

                           As God is the common Father of all, we pray for all. Let none fear on account of their lowly station here, for all are comprised
                           in the same heavenly nobility. ... By saying, "who art in heaven," he does not mean to insinuate that he is <i>there</i> only,
                           but he wishes to withdraw the humble petitioner from earth, and fix his attention on heaven. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xx.) Other
                           prayers are not forbidden. Jesus Christ prayed in different words (John, chap. viii.[xvii.?]), and the apostles; (Acts i,
                           24,) but this is an example of the simple style to be used in prayer, and is applicable to all occasions. --- <i>Hallowed
                           </i>be thy name, from the word <i>holy,</i> be held and kept holy, be glorified by us, and that not only by our words, but
                           principally by the lives we lead. The honour and glory of God should be the principal subject of our prayers, and the ultimate
                           end of our every action; every other thing must be subordinate to this. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Our supersubstantial bread.</i>[3] So it is at present in the Latin text: yet the same Greek word in St. Luke, is translated
                           <i>daily bread,</i> as we say it in our Lord's prayer, and as it was used to be said in the second or third age, as we find
                           by Tertullian and St. Cyprian. Perhaps the Latin word, <i>supersubstantialis,</i> may bear the same sense as daily bread,
                           or bread that we daily stand in need of; for it need not be taken for supernatural bread, but for bread which is daily <i>added,</i>
                           to maintain and support the substance of our bodies. (Witham) --- In St. Luke the same word is rendered <i>daily bread.</i>
                           It is understood of the bread of life, which we receive in the blessed sacrament. (Challoner) --- It is also understood of
                           the supernatural support of the grace of God, and especially of the bread of life received in the blessed eucharist. (Haydock)
                           --- As we are only to pray for our daily bread, we are not to be over solicitous for the morrow, nor for the things of this
                           earth, but being satisfied with what is necessary, turn all our thoughts to the joys of heaven. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xx.)</font></p><b>

                           Of all the petitions this alone is repeated twice. God puts our judgment in our own hands, that none might complain, being
                           the author of his own sentence. He could have forgiven us our sins without this condition, but he consulted our good, in affording
                           us opportunities of practising daily the virtues of piety and mildness. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xx.) --- These debts signify
                           not only <i>mortal</i> but <i>venial</i> sins, as St. Augustine often teaches. Therefore every man, be he ever so just, yet
                           because he cannot live without venial sin, ought to say this prayer. (Cont. 2 epis. Pelag. lib. i. chap. 14.) --- (lib. xxi.

                           God is not the tempter of evil, or author of sin. (James i. 13.) He tempteth no man: we pray that he would not suffer the
                           devil to tempt us above our strength: that he would remove the temptations, or enable us to overcome them, and deliver us
                           from evil, particularly the evil of sin, which is the first, and the greatest, and the true efficient cause of all evils.
                           (Haydock) --- In the Greek we here read, for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory; which words are found in
                           some old Greek liturgies, and there is every appearance that they have thence slipped into the text of St. Matthew. They do
                           not occur in St. Luke (vi. 4.[xi. 4.?]), nor in any one of the old Latin copies, nor yet in the most ancient of the Greek
                           texts. The holy Fathers prior to St. Chrysostom, as Grotius observes, who have explained the Lord's prayer, never mention
                           these words. --- And not being found in Tertullian, St. Cyprian, St. Jerome, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, &amp;c., nor in the
                           Vatican Greek copy, nor in the Cambridge manuscripts. &amp;c. as Dr. Wells also observes, it seems certain that they were
                           only a pious conclusion, or doxology, with which the Greeks in the fourth age began to conclude their prayers, much after
                           the same manner as, <i>Glory be to the Father,</i> &amp;c. was added to the end of each psalm. We may reasonably presume,
                           that these words at first were in the margin of some copies, and afterwards by some transcribers taken into the text itself.

                           The forty days' fast, my dear brethren, is not an observance peculiar to ourselves; it is kept by all who unite with us in
                           the profession of the same faith. Nor is it without reason that the fast of Christ should be an observance common to all Christians.
                           What is more reasonable, than that the different members should follow the example of the head. If we have been made partakers
                           with him of good, why not also of evil. Is it generous to exempt ourselves from every thing that is painful, and with to partake
                           with him in all that is agreeable? With such dispositions, we are members unworthy of such a head. ... Is it much for us to
                           fast with Christ, who expect to sit at the table of his Father with him? Is it much for the members to suffer with the head,
                           when we expect to be made one day partakers with him in glory? Happy the man who shall imitate such a Master. He shall accompany
                           him whithersoever he goes. (St. Bernard Serm, in Quad.) --- Wherefore, my dear brethren, if the taste only has caused us to
                           offend God, let the taste only fast, and it will be enough. But if the other members also have sinned, let them also fast.
                           Let the eye fast, if it has been the cause of sin to the soul; let the ear fast, the tongue, the hand, and the soul itself.
                           Let the eye fast from beholding objects, which are only calculated to excite curiosity and vanity; that being now humbled,
                           it may be restrained to repentance, which before wandered in guilt. Let the ear fast from listening to idle stories and words
                           that have no reference to salvation. Let the tongue fast from detraction and murmuring, from unprofitable and sacrilegious
                           discourse; sometimes also, out of respect to holy silence, from speaking what appears necessary and profitable. Let the hand
                           also fast from useless works, and from every action that is not commanded. But above all, let the soul fast from sin and the
                           doing of its own will. Without these fasts, all others will not be accepted by the Lord. (St. Bernard, Serm. 2 de Jejun. Quad.)
                           --- Fast from what is in itself lawful, that you may receive pardon for what you have formerly done amiss. Redeem an eternal
                           fast by a short and transitory one. For we have deserved hell fire, where there will be no food, no consolation, no end; where
                           the rich man begs for a drop of water, and is not worthy to receive it. A truly good and salutary fast, the observance of
                           which frees us from eternal punishment, by obtaining for us in this life the remission of our sins. Nor is it only the remission
                           of former transgressions, but likewise a preservative against future sin, by meriting for us grace to enable us to avoid those
                           faults we might otherwise have committed. I will add another advantage, which results from tasting, one which I hope I am
                           not deceived in saying you have frequently experienced. It gives devotion and confidence to prayer. Observe how closely prayer
                           and fasting are connected. Prayer gives us power to fast, fasting enables us to pray. Fasting gives strength to our prayer,
                           prayer sanctifies our fast, and renders it worthy of acceptance before the Lord. (St. Bernard, Serm. de Orat. &amp; []ejun.)</font></p><b>

                           The morrow will bring with it cares enough, to occupy you in providing what will then be necessary for you. Christ does not
                           prohibit all care about temporal concerns, but only what hinders us from seeking the kingdom of heaven in the first instance;
                           or what makes us esteem more the things of this world, than those of the next. (Menochius) --- The affliction and labour which
                           each day brings with it is a sufficient trial, nor ought we seek by our anxiety for labour and affliction before it arrive;
                           for why should man forestall the evil day, which has not arrived, and perhaps may never arrive? But again, this does not prohibit
                           us from making a provision for the morrow, for Jesus Christ does not say to us, provide not for the morrow, but, be not solicitous
                           for to-morrow. (Estius, in different location) He who supplied our wants to-day, will supply them also to-morrow. The evil
                           of the day is sufficient, without borrowing to-morrow's burden to increase the load. It is the curse of the envious and wicked
                           to be self-tormented, whilst they who live by faith, can always rejoice in hope, the true balm of every Christian's breast,
