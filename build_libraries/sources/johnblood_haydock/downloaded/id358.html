                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 It was told Laban on the third day, that Jacob fled.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And he saw in a dream God saying to him: Take heed thou speak not

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and when he, with

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And he said to Jacob: Why hast thou done thus, to carry away, without

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 Why wouldst thou run away privately, and not acquaint me, that I might

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 It is in my power to return thee evil; but the God of your father
                                    said to me yesterday: *Take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy friends, and hadst a longing

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 Jacob answered: That I departed unknown to thee, <i>it was </i>for

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 But, whereas, thou chargest me with theft: with whomsoever thou shalt

                                    when he said this, he knew not that Rachel had stolen the idols.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 So Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and of Lia, and of both the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 She, in haste, hid the idols under the camel's furniture, and sat
                                    upon them: and when he had searched all the tent, and found nothing,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 She said: Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee,
                                    because it has now happened to me according to the custom of women. So his careful search was in vain.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And Jacob being angry, said in a chiding manner: For what fault of
                                    mine, and for what offense on my part hast thou so hotly pursued me,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 And searched all my household stuff? What hast thou found of all the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 Have I, therefore, been with thee twenty years? thy ewes and goats

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 And in this manner have I served thee in thy house twenty years, fourteen

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 Unless the God of my father, Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had stood

                                    yesterday.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 Laban answered him: The daughters are mine, and the children, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a title.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">47 And Laban called it, The witness heap; and Jacob, The hillock of testimony:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">48 And Laban said: This heap shall be a witness between me and thee this

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">51 And he said again to Jacob: Behold this heap, and the stone which
