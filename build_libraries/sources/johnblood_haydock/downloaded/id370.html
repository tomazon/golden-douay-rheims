                           Egypt. The Hebrews generally took something at this time, and again in the evening. To eat before noon was esteemed a mark
                           of intemperance. (Ecclesiastes x. 16; Acts ii. 15.) Plato thought the people of Italy, who eat two full meals in the day,

                           ii. 41, says, they would not use a knife which had been in the hands of a Greek, nor kiss him. This aversion arose, from their
                           custom of abstaining from various meats which other nations eat. (Chaldean; &amp;c.) They disliked the Hebrews, because they
                           were also <i>shepherds,</i> chap. xlvi. 34 (Calmet); and because they knew they were accustomed to eat goats, oxen, and sheep,
                           the objects of adoration in Egypt, (Exodus viii. 26): though they were not, probably, served upon Joseph's table. (Tirinus)
                           --- They who dwelt in the towns could not bear even the Egyptian shepherds, because they were of a more stirring and warlike

                           <i>They sat.</i> This posture is more ancient than that of lying down at table. The Hebrews adopted the latter, from the Persians,
                           during the captivity, Esther i. 6, and vii. 8. --- We have at least no earlier vestige of this custom in Scripture. (Calmet)
                           --- <i>Very much:</i> as they were placed in that order by the steward. They knew not how he could so exactly discover who
                           was born first, as there was so short an interval between the births of many of them. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           him, though he was placed in the highest place at table among the Greeks, and had the largest portion both of meat and drink.
                           --- <i>Merry.</i> <i>Inebriati sunt,</i> sometimes means intoxicated: but it is not at all probably that Joseph's brethren
                           would indulge in any such excess, while they knew him not, (Calmet) and were under the impressions of fear and wonder. They
                           took what was sufficient, and even decently abundant, with thankfulness for so unexpected an honour. (Haydock) --- The word
                           is often taken in this sense, as at the feast of Cana, where Jesus would never have furnished such an abundance of wine for
                           people already drunk. (John ii. 10; Proverbs xi. 24[25?].) Homer's feasts consist in every man taking what he pleased. (Calmet)</font></p></blockquote>

                                    <p>1 In the mean time *the famine was heavy upon all the land.</p>
                                    <p>2 And when they had eaten up all the corn, which they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said to his sons: Go again, and buy
                                    us a little food.</p>
                                    <p>3 Juda answered: The man declared unto us with the attestation of an oath, saying: You shall not see my face, unless you
                                    bring your youngest brother with you.</p>
                                    <p>4 If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we will set out together, and will buy necessaries for thee.</p>
                                    <p>5 But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the man, as we have often said, declared unto us, saying:* You shall not see
                                    my face without your youngest brother.</p>
                                    <p>6 Israel said to them: You have done this for my misery, in that you told him you had also another brother.</p>
                                    <p>7 But they answered: The man asked us in order concerning our kindred: if our father lived: if we had a brother: and we
                                    answered him regularly, according to what he demanded: could we know that he would say: Bring hither your brother with you?</p>
                                    <p>8 And Juda said to his father: Send the boy with me, that we may set forward, and may live: lest both we and our children
                                    perish.</p>
                                    <p>9 *I take the boy upon me, require him at my hand: unless I bring him again, and restore him to thee, I will be guilty
                                    of sin against thee for ever.</p>
                                    <p>10 If delay had not been made, we had been here again the second time.</p>
                                    <p>11 Then Israel said to them: If it must needs be so, do what you will: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels,
                                    and carry down presents to the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax, myrrh, turpentine, and almonds.</p>
                                    <p>12 And take with you double money, and carry back what you found in your sacks, lest perhaps it was done by mistake.</p>
                                    <p>13 And take also your brother, and go to the man.</p>
                                    <p>14 And may my almighty God make him favourable to you: and send back with you your brother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin:
                                    and as for me I shall be desolate without children.</p>
                                    <p>15 So the men took the presents, and double money, and Benjamin: and went down into Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</p>
                                    <p>16 And when he had seen them, and Benjamin with them, he commanded the steward of his house, saying: Bring in the men into
                                    the house, and kill victims, and prepare a feast: because they shall eat with me at noon.</p>
                                    <p>17 He did as he was commanded, and brought the men into the house.</p>
                                    <p>18 And they being much afraid, said there one to another: Because of the money, which we carried back the first time in
                                    our sacks, we are brought in: that he may bring upon us a false accusation, and by violence make slaves of us and our asses.</p>
                                    <p>19 Wherefore, going up to the steward of the house, at the door,</p>
                                    <p>20 They said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us. *We came down once before to buy food:</p>
                                    <p>21 And when we had bought, and were come to the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our money in the mouths of the sacks:
                                    which we have now brought again in the same weight.</p>
                                    <p>22 And we have brought other money besides, to buy what we want: we cannot tell who put it in our bags.</p>
                                    <p>23 But he answered: Peace be with you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your
                                    sacks. For the money, which you gave me, I have for good. And he brought Simeon out to them.</p>
                                    <p>24 And having brought them into the house, he fetched water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to their
                                    asses.</p>
                                    <p>25 But they made ready the presents, against Joseph came at noon: for they had heard that they should eat bread there.</p>
                                    <p>26 Then Joseph came in to his house, and they offered him the presents, holding them in their hands; and they bowed down
                                    with their face to the ground.</p>
                                    <p>27 But he courteously saluting them again, asked them, saying: Is the old man your father in health, of whom you told me?
                                    Is he yet living?</p>
                                    <p>28 And they answered: Thy servant our father, is in health; he is yet living. And bowing themselves, they made obeisance
                                    to him.</p>
                                    <p>29 And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Benjamin, his brother by the same mother, and said: Is this your young brother,
                                    of whom you told me? And he said: God be gracious to thee, my son.</p>
                                    <p>30 And he made haste, because his heart was moved upon his brother, and tears gushed out: and going into his chamber, he
                                    wept.</p>
                                    <p>31 And when he had washed his face, coming out again, he refrained himself, and said: Set bread on the table.</p>
                                    <p>32 And when it was set on, for Joseph apart, and for his brethren apart, for the Egyptians also that ate with him apart,
                                    (for it is unlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they think such a feast profane):</p>
                                    <p>33 They sat before him, the first-born according to his birth-right, and the youngest according to his age. And they wondered
                                    very much;</p>
                                    <p>34 Taking the messes which they received of him: and the greater mess came to Benjamin, so that it exceeded by five parts.
                                    And they drank, and were merry with him.</p>
