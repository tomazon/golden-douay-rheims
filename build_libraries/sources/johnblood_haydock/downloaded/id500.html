                           So the Vulgate often expresses the Hebrew term, which signifies, "to cast out." --- <I>Seven.</I> Ten are mentioned, Genesis
                           xv. 9; but some of the less powerful nations were either mixed with the others, or were exterminated. The Hevites are omitted
                           in the passage of Genesis, and sometimes no notice is taken of the Gergezite or the Pherezite. The latter had been already
                           conquered by Moses, as well as the Raphaim and Amorrhites, over whom Og and Sehon ruled, chap. iii. 5. (Calmet) --- It seems,
                           however, that some of the same nations, on the other side of the Jordan, remained to be subdued, and that any one of them
                           was naturally too strong for the Hebrews, ver. 7. Hence the latter might be convinced, that their victories were to be attributed
                           to God.</FONT></P><B>

                           Yet Josue, (ix. 3,) by mistake, entered into one with the Gabaonites, and observed it; (Haydock) whence we may conclude, that
                           only such leagues are forbidden as would leave these nations in possession of their lands and idols, chap. xx. 10., and xxiii.
                           6. With foreign nations it was lawful to make leagues defensive and offensive, as David, Asa, and the Machabees did with Hiram,
                           Benadad, and the Romans, 3 Kings xv. 18, &amp;c. If the Hebrews were so hostile to the nations of Chanaan, it was in execution
                           of God's decree, who had sentenced them to die; and Tacitus hence unjustly inferred, that <I>they hated all</I> but their
                           own nation. See Grotius, Jur. ii. 15. --- <I>Them.</I> This was ill executed. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xiii. 13.) (Judges

                           Some believe that it was unlawful to marry the people of Chanaan, if they were even converted, and also those of other nations,
                           as we find that Esdras (1 Esdras x. 2, 12,) ordered such <I>strange wives</I> to be sent away. But the context shews, as well
                           as the practice of most pious Hebrews, that it was only forbidden to marry with those who adhered to their idolatry, ver.
                           4. Salmon took to wife Rahab, of Jericho; Mahalon and Booz successively married Ruth, the Moabitess, and Moses himself allows
                           the Hebrews to espouse their captives, and to preserve the lives of women and children, chap. xx. 14., and xxi. 11. (Calmet)
                           See Exodus xxxiv. 15. --- Hence all the Chanaanites were not necessarily to be slain. The few exceptions did not hinder the
                           rule from being general. See ver. 16., and Numbers xiv. 23.</FONT></P><B>

                           So great is the natural tendency to evil, that though a woman be generally inclined to follow the inclinations and religion
                           of her husband, yet, when his method of living is more repugnant to flesh and blood, she is but too apt to influence him to
                           glide smoothly with her down the hill of pleasure, into the very abyss of dissolution. The prediction, <I>she will turn,</I>
                           &amp;c., is so often verified, that those who marry with unbelievers ought to tremble. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           This was to be done with regard to the idols of Chanaan, when it was first conquered, ver. 25. Afterwards David made no scruple
                           in wearing a crown, which had been taken from the spoils of Melchon, the idol of the Ammonites, 1 Paralipomenon xx. 2. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew <I>sogula,</I> laid up like something most precious and desirable. (Menochius) --- God seemed to have abandoned other
                           nations to the corruption of their own heart. "This was, by a particular mystery, a prophetical nation." (St. Augustine, ep.
                           cii.) (Exodus xix. 5.) (Calmet) --- Therefore must they destroy every idol in their land, to set a pattern to all other less

                           Hebrew, "he will repay to his face," or "he will punish immediately the person who hateth him to his face." God does not always
                           defer the correction of the wicked till their death. (Calmet) --- But this seems to be spoken principally of those who have
                           engaged in the covenant, 2 Machabees vi. 12. (Du Hamel) --- Thus he immediately chastised those who adored the calf, Core,
                           Mary [Miriam], &amp;c., (Menochius) and he does not dissemble the faults even of his chosen servants. (Tirinus) --- The Chaldean
                           and some Rabbins give another interpretation. "The Lord rewards his enemies for the good works which they perform in this
                           life, reserving their punishment till the life to come. He does not delay to reward what good they do, but he will punish
                           them (for their crimes) in another world." (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           of the inhabitants of Grand Cairo have sore eyes, or are blind. (Brun.) --- Joinville speaks of the diseases which attacked
                           the army of St. Louis in Egypt, preying chiefly upon the legs and gums, and causing them to putrify. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Abenezra understands the leprosy, which the Hebrew may also signify. But hornets and such like insects are very destructive
                           in hot countries; and Pausanias informs us that the Minsiens were driven out of their country by them. (Calmet) --- God destroyed
                           the army of Sapor II, the Persian king, by sending an army of gnats, at the prayer of St. James of Nisibis, A.D. 350. "Lord,
                           said the saint, thou art able by the weakest means to humble the pride of thy enemies, defeat these multitudes by an army
                           of gnats." (Butler, Lives of the Saints, July 11.) --- We may, therefore, explain this text in a literal sense. (Calmet) (Wisdom
                           xii. 8., and xvi. 9., and Josue xxiv. 12.)</FONT></P><B>
