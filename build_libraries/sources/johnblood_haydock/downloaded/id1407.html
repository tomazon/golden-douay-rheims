                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 But if he be afraid to pass over, and camp on the other side of the
                                    river, we will pass over to them and shall prevail against him. 42 Now when Judas came near the torrent of water, he set the
                                    scribes of the people by the torrent, and commanded them, saying: Suffer no man to stay behind: but let all come to the battle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 And he passed over to them first, and all the people after him, and
                                    all the heathens were discomfited before them, and they threw away their weapons, and fled to the temple that was in Carnaim.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 And he took that city, and the temple he burnt with fire, with all
                                    things that were therein: and Carnaim was subdued, and could not stand against the face of Judas.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">45 And Judas gathered together all the Israelites that were in the land
                                    of Galaad, from the least even to the greatest, and their wives and children, and an army exceeding great, to come into the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">46 And they came as far as Ephron: now this was a great city, situate
                                    in the way, strongly fortified, and there was no means to turn from it on the right hand or on the left, but the way was through
                                    the midst of it.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">47 And they that were in the city, shut themselves in, and stopped up
                                    the gates with stones: and Judas sent to them with peaceable words,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">48 Saying: Let us pass through your land, to go into our country: and
                                    no man shall hurt you; we will only pass through on foot. But they would not open to them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">49 Then Judas commanded proclamation to be made in the camp, that they
                                    should make an assault, every man in the place where he was.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">50 And the men of the army drew near, and he assaulted that city all
                                    the day, and all the night; and the city was delivered into his hands: </font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">51 And they slew every male with the edge of the sword; and he razed
                                    the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed through all the city over them that were slain.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">52 Then they passed over the Jordan to the great plain that is over-against

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">53 And Judas gathered together the hindmost, and he exhorted the people,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">54 And they went up to Mount Sion with joy and gladness, and offered
                                    holocausts, because not one of them was slain, till they had returned in peace.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">55 Now in the days that Judas and Jonathan were in the land of Galaad,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">56 Joseph, the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captain of the soldiers,
                                    heard of the good success, and the battles that were fought,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">57 And he said: Let us also get us a name, and let us go fight against

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">58 And he gave charge to them that were in his army, and they went towards

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">59 And Gorgias and his men went out of the city, to give them battle.</font></p>

                                    borders of Judea: and there fell on that day, of the people of Israel, about two thousand men, and there was a great overthrow
                                    of the people:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">61 Because they did not hearken to Judas and his brethren, thinking that

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">62 But they were not of the seed of those men by whom salvation was brought

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">63 And the men of Juda were magnified exceedingly in the sight of all

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">64 And people assembled to them with joyful acclamations.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">65 Then Judas and his brethren went forth and attacked the children of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">66 And he removed his camp to go into the land of the aliens, and he

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">67 In that day some priests fell in battle, while desiring to do manfully

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">68 And Judas turned to Azotus, into the land of the strangers, and he
                                    threw down their altars, and he burnt the statues of their gods with fire: and he took the spoils of the cities, and returned
                                    into the land of Juda. </font></p>
