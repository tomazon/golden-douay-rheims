                           latter as most plausible. David, however, seems to have written this last most beautiful piece, when he placed his son upon
                           the throne; (3 Kings i. 47.) and being transported with a divine enthusiasm, he described the reign of the Messias, (Calmet)
                           to whom alone many of the passages can be applied, (St. Augustine; Worthington) as the Jews, Chaldean, Kimchi, &amp;c., confess,

                           governors, as obedience is that of subjects. Solomon acted with the greatest sagacity, 1 Paralipomenon xxii. 10., and xxix.

                           under God's protection. To him even judges and monarchs must give an account, Deuteronomy i. 17., and 2 Paralipomenon xix.

                           justice and peace, Micheas vi. 1. Solomon was to enjoy a perpetual peace, (1 Paralipomenon xxii. 9.) as he was a figure of
                           Jesus Christ, who has procured a more solid one for us, Ephesians ii. 14., John xiv. 27., and Isaias lii. 7. (Calmet) ---
                           Hebrew has "by righteousness," as this is the source of true peace, Romans xiv. 17. These virtues are publicly enforced in
                           the Church, as from a mountain, Isaias ii. 2. (Berthier) --- Christ, the rock, (Haydock) and his ministers, the <i>hills,</i>

                           Isaias xi. 4. Solomon was also the reverse of those wicked princes, who receive bribes, and neglect the poor, Isaias i. 23.

                           do not insinuate that he will ever cease to be. (Theodoret) --- The kingdom of David and Solomon is described in the same
                           poetic language, (Psalm lxxxviii. 28., and 37.; Calmet) as it will remain for ever in the hands of the Messias. (Haydock)
                           --- Hebrew makes a sudden address to the king, "they shall fear thee with the sun," which Houbigant dislikes. Some letters
                           may have been changed, though the sense is not bad. (Berthier) --- "They shall fear thee at the rising of the sun, and shall
                           pray to they by the light of the moon," Chaldean, both day and night. (Calmet) --- Solomon, as a figure of Christ, was good
                           for some time; but no king, except our Saviour, will reign for ever. (Worthington) --- The mind of the prophet is now raised

                           the utmost eloquence, 3 Kings iv. 34. (Calmet) --- Some supply His <i>justice,</i> (ver. 7.) or rather, "his word" shall come,

                           Chaldean, "till those who adore the moon be exterminated." This idolatry pervaded almost all the east. Solomon's reign was
                           very peaceable, 3 Kings iv. 25. But this was only a feeble representation of the peace which Christ should bring. At his birth,
                           the whole world was at peace. Angels proclaimed it to all the earth, Luke ii. 14., and Isaias ii. 4. (Calmet) --- It is certain,
                           that the internal peace of Solomon's reign did not continue to the end, (Haydock) much less till the moon should be taken

                           all Arabia tributary to him, (Haydock) and the countries as far as Syria; so that he enjoyed all that had been promised by
                           God, Genesis xv. 18., Numbers xxxiv. 3., and 2 Paralipomenon ix. 26., and 3 Kings iv. 24. --- <i>The earth,</i> denotes this
                           kingdom. (St. Jerome in Isaias xiii. 4.) But if we explain it of Christ, his Church has no limits. In spite of the corruption
                           of the world, she still asserts her title of Catholic. (Calmet) --- She is universal, both as to time and place, and always
                           visible, ver. 15. (Worthington) --- Her divine head began to propagate this kingdom, after he had been baptized in the <i>river</i>
                           Jordan, (Berthier) as the Fathers agree. This unlimited dominion was promised, (Psalm ii. 7.; Calmet) and the prophet Zachary,
                           (Zacharias ix.) seems to quote this passage, when speaking of the Messias alone; so that it is best to understand it in this

                           as well as those in islands, and ships, shall submit to Solomon, (3 Kings x. 11.) as all shall yield to Christ, (Calmet) at

                           in Timothy, &amp;c.) and more under Eleutherius; though the English nation received the faith from St. Augustine of Canterbury
                           and others, sent by Pope Gregory the Great, A.D. 596. (Worthington) --- <i>Saba.</i> Hebrew <i>Seba.</i> The preceding Arabia

                           xviii. (Calmet) --- If the former term, <i>presents,</i> (Hebrew <i>mincha,</i> "a sacrifice of flour," &amp;c.; Haydock)
                           be taken in the strict sense, the text cannot be applicable to any but the true God, the Messias. (Berthier) --- The wise

                           blood is precious," Psalm cxv. 15., and 1 Kings xxvi. 21. Solomon repressed all injustice, so that usury was banished, and
                           the poor was so much enriched, as not to be forced to borrow. (Calmet) --- Yet, after his fall, he laid heavy burdens on his
                           people. (Haydock) --- How much has the name and blood of Christians cost! Yet we fear not to scandalize those (Berthier) for
                           whom Christ died! The most beautiful qualification of all in power is, to protect the poor, and to promote the work of God,
