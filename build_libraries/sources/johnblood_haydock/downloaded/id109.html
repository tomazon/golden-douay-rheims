                           for a short continuance; and this absence will be honourable and glorious for me, and extremely advantageous for you. If you
                           were fully persuaded of this, you would inquire, how long I should be absent, and whither I was going; as one friend in the
                           act of parting, is always accustomed to ask another. But you only torture your minds with the pain and grief you will have

                           soon he was to return to them, or if to return at all. For it is customary with friends, to put the most minute questions

                           have occasioned a great many expositions. I here follow St. Cyril, that the Holy Ghost will condemn the Jews, and all obstinate
                           unbelievers, <I>of</I> their <I>sin,</I> in not believing, after so many miracles, and so many pregnant motives, that ought

                           and also, that true justice and sanctification cannot be obtained, but by his grace. 3rdly, Of <I>judgment,</I> by shewing
                           that the world, and the prince of this wicked world, the devil, is justly condemned, his empire in a great measure destroyed,
                           and that all the wicked will be justly condemned, and punished with him. (Witham) --- The Holy Ghost, by his coming, brought
                           over many thousands, 1st, To a sense of their sin, in not believing in Christ. 2ndly, To a conviction of the justice of Christ,
                           now sitting at the right hand of his Father. And 3rdly, To a right apprehension of the judgment prepared for them that choose
                           to follow Satan, who is already judged and condemned. (Challoner) --- The Greek text, in addition, has&nbsp;<I><U>oti ou pisteuousin
                           eis eme</U>.</I> Because they have not believed in me. This accusation and conviction of sin, cannot naturally fall on any,
                           but the incredulous Jews. St. Augustine, Ven. Bede, St. Chrysostom, Theophylactus, and many others, are of opinion, that this
                           sin was their unbelief in Jesus, after all the miracles he had done in their presence, after so many prophecies so clearly
                           accomplished in his person, after so many prodigies and wonders, which happened at his death, at his resurrection, and after
                           his resurrection. They are accused, and convinced of sin, particularly by sensible effects of the Holy Spirit, in the apostles,
                           by the gift of miracles and tongues, and that supernatural knowledge, which was communicated, not only to the apostles, but
                           also to all the first Christians. These are the means, which the Paraclete, the consoling and assisting Spirit, makes us of,
                           to condemn, and convince the world of sin; that is, of incredulity, which is the source and foundation of all other sins.
                           The world had calumniated and despised its Saviour. It had condemned him, as a liar, as a seducer, magician, a man possessed
                           by the devil, a destroyer of the law of God. To which the Son of God made no resistance; he only replied, that he did not
                           wish to take the execution of justice upon himself, and that he was not come into the world to judge the world. Therefore,
                           he committed all to the Holy Spirit, who, in the persons of the apostles, did justice to the Son, by shewing to the whole
                           world, his doctrines, his life, his miracles, and the accomplishment of all the ancient prophecies in his person. All that
                           the apostles preached, they confirmed by most stupendous miracles, gained the hearts of pagans to believe Jesus as their Redeemer,
                           and called down imprecations upon the heads of the incredulous Jews, who had rejected a prophet, visibly sent by God, a Saviour
                           and Redeemer of his people, who, in his person, bore all the characters of the divinity. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           &amp;c.) (Witham) --- If he shall teach all truth, and that for ever, (chap. xi; ver. 26.) how is it possible, that the Church
                           can err, or hath erred in matters of faith, at any time, or in any point of doctrine? In this supposition, would not the Holy
                           Ghost have forfeited his title of <I>Spirit of Truth?</P></I></FONT></FONT><B>

                           words in this manner: that after a little while, you shall not see me, because even to-morrow, I shall be taken from you by
                           death: and again, <I>after a little while, you shall see me,</I> because the third day I shall rise again, and converse with
                           you, till my ascension. St. Augustine gives another interpretation, (tract. 101.) that by the first <I>little while,</I> may
                           be understood, the short time till Christ's ascension, and by the latter <I>little while,</I> the short time that the apostles
                           were to live in this world; after which they should <I>see,</I> and enjoy Christ for ever in the kingdom of heaven. And this
                           exposition seems to agree better with the following promise. (Witham) --- In a few hours, I shall be separated from you, to
                           be delivered up to my enemies, and put to the cruel death of the cross; and after a short time, I shall rise again; then you
                           shall see me in my new state of glory. St. Chrysostom, both Sts. Cyrils, Theophylactus, Euthymius, St. Augustine, and others,
                           interpret this verse differently; thus: Not long hence, I shall be entirely separated from you; you shall not see me, because
                           I shall go to the Father, by my ascension; but you shall see me again, after a short time, at my second coming, to judge the
                           living and the dead. All the time, that shall pass between my ascension, and my second coming, is in the eyes of God only
                           as a moment. For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday, which is past and gone. (Psalm lxxxix. ver. 4.) And the
                           apostle calls all time a moment, a time that soon passes. (1 Corinthians vii. and 2 Corinthians iv.)</FONT></P><B>
