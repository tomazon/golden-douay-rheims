                           are divided in their opinions about the nature of St. Paul's employment: but it is generally supposed to be making tents of
                           skins, such as were formerly used by travellers and soldiers. (Tirinus) --- Hence the expression, esse sub pellibus. The apostle
                           submitted to this labour, that he might be no burden to those to whom he preached the gospel. (St. Augustine, tract. in Joan.)
                           --- The Jews, with their characteristic good sense, in matters of this kind, made it the first duty of parents, to teach their
                           children some trade, by which they might gain their livelihood. To neglect this was supposed to be equivalent to teaching
                           them to steal. Hence their learned men were likewise practitioners in some laborious trade. They were ignorant of the distinction
                           between low, and honourable professions, which refinement and vanity have introduced among us. Every employment was honourable,
                           which was conducive to the good of their neighbour, and compatible with virtue and modesty; and the more so, in proportion
                           as the wants of mankind made it more necessary. See Fleury's Manners of the Israelites. (Passim.)</FONT></P><B>

                           Gallio was brother to the great Seneca, Nero's preceptor, as that author himself assures us. (Præf. lib. v. Quæs. Natur.)
                           He was called Annæus Novatus, but took the name of Gallio by adoption, and was made proconsul by his brother's interest, whose
                           honours and disgraces he equally participated. Being condemned to death by Nero, he laid violent hands upon himself. It is
                           probable St. Paul became acquainted with Seneca. St. Jerome and St. Augustine say, many letters passed between them, which
                           are not now extant. (Tirinus) See also Eusebius. An. Christi 66. [The year A.D. 66.]</FONT></P><B>

                           &amp;c. It was customary among the Jews to make vows of abstaining from all inebriating liquor, not to cut their hair for
                           a limited time, &amp;c. This was the vow of the Nazarites, mentioned in Numbers vi. 18; Acts xxii. 24.[xxi. 24.?]&nbsp;St.
                           Paul had probably taken upon himself some obligation of this kind; perhaps in condescension to the Jews, who were yet weak
                           in faith. The time being now expired, he cut his hair as before. It was lawful for converts to observe these legal ceremonies,
                           till the gospel was perfectly established, provided they did not place their hopes of salvation in them, or believe that the
                           faith and grace of Christ were ineffectual without them. (Denis the Carthusian) --- <I>For he had a vow,</I> that is, Paul,
                           not Aquila. This seems to have been such a vow, as those called Nazarenes, used to make, of abstaining from wine for a time,
                           of not cutting their hair, and of making some offerings in the temple at Jerusalem. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           extraordinary that St. Luke should have omitted the express mention of the city. But having told us his object was to be at
                           Jerusalem, he perhaps thought it was enough to say, <I>he went up.</I> (Calmet) --- In Palestine, the expression, <I>to go
                           up,</I> was sometimes taken for going up to Jerusalem. (John vii. 8. 10; John xii. 20; Acts xxiv. 11) And reciprocally in
                           Acts chap. xxiv. 1. <I>to go down,</I> is taken for going down from Jerusalem to Cæsarea. (Bible de Vence) --- <I>He went
                           up.</I> In the Scripture, when Antioch and Cæsarea are simply mentioned, Antioch, in Syria, and Cæsarea, in Palestine, are

                           we shall not be so much surprised, that this zealous convert should not yet be perfectly instructed in every doctrine of Christianity.
