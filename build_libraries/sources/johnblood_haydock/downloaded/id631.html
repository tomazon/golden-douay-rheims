                           A city in the tribe of Benjamin, to which the tabernacle of the Lord had been translated from Silo. (Challoner) --- It was
                           about 12 miles south-west of Gabaa. (Tudelensis.) --- There was another Nobe on the east side of the Jordan, to which Serarius
                           thinks David was three days in travelling. But when David made that assertion, he wished to conceal the real state of his
                           affairs, as he had not seen Saul since he was at Najoth, ver. 5. Nobe was afterwards accounted a sacerdotal city, ver. 19.,
                           and 2 Esdras xi. 32. --- <I>Achimelech,</I> who is perhaps the same with Achia (chap. xiv. 3,) and Abiathar, Mark ii. 32.

                           to understand that he had some attendants, (ver. 2) as the gospel relates, Matthew xii. 3. He dismissed them before he entered

                           it is essentially evil. (Calmet) --- <I>And such,</I> which he deems it unnecessary to specify. Septuagint retain the Hebrew

                           to our tremendous mysteries? And what reason hath the Church of God to admit none to be her ministers, to consecrate and daily
                           receive this most pure sacrament, but such as devote themselves to a life of perpetual purity. (Challoner) --- <I>Women.</I>
                           God required this on many occasions, Exodus xix. 15. Urgent necessity determined Achimelech to grant the loaves, as our Saviour
                           intimates, though it is probable that he first consulted the Lord, chap. xxii. 16. (Calmet) --- David perhaps went to Nobe
                           on purpose to ask advice. (Menochius) --- We have here an example of a dispensation, and of the distinction between <I>lay,</I>

                           Septuagint, "the journey is (of a disagreeable nature, or) impure, therefore it will be rendered holy by my vessels," or arms,

                           He is elsewhere called Achimelech. This bold step was taken by God's order, (Salien) or secret impulse, as the high priest
                           and Doeg knew not whither David had directed his course. (Haydock) --- Sanchez thinks David received no express declaration,
                           as the event was not very prosperous. (Menochius) --- Many great men have taken refuge among their greatest enemies, as Themistocles,
                           Alcibiades, and Coriolanus fled respectively to the Persians, Lacedæmonians, and Volscians, and were received with great respect.
                           Indeed the acquisition of such men is equivalent to a victory. (Calmet) --- Though David might expect that his name would
                           be hateful at Geth, as he had slain their great champion, &amp;c., yet he had done it in an open manner, and had displayed
                           the most heroic courage, so that the king and nobility might raise their thoughts above the vulgar sentiments of jealousy
                           and revenge. (Salien) --- David only retired from the court of this king, to avoid the hatred of the courtiers; he returned
                           again, and was kindly received, chap. xxvii. 1. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           double translation. St. Augustine says, "we cannot understand how David could be carried in his own hands. But we understand
                           how it was verified in Christ. For Christ was carried in his own hands at his last supper, when he gave, <I>or</I> commending,
                           his own body, he said, This, &amp;c., for he then carried his own body in his own hands." (In Psalm xxxiii. conc. i.) <I>Ferebat
                           enim illud corpus in manibus suis.</I> Amama may laugh at St. Augustine's ignorance of Hebrew, but the holy doctor was at
                           least a sincere Catholic. (Haydock) --- <I>Beard.</I> We find some wretched objects doing the same, Mark ix. 17. The spittle
                           was deemed infectious. <I>Et illic isti qui sputatur, morbus interdum venit.</I> (Plautus in Captivis.)</FONT></P><B>

                           David had not rushed into the palace of his own accord, but wished to remain concealed. Some of the people however knew him,
                           and would have him to enlist as one of the soldiers of Achis; (Menochius) or even designed to get him put to death, which
                           made him have recourse to this expedient. Some of the saints have imitated him, to avoid worldly honours and dignities of
                           the Church. (Haydock) --- Thus the conduct of Jesus Christ himself, was accounted foolishness by worldlings, Mark iii. 21.,
                           Luke xxiii. 11., and 1 Corinthians i. 23. (Ven. Bede) (Worthington)</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT><FONT

                                    and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.</font></p>

                                    women, we have refrained ourselves from yesterday and the day before, when we came out, and the vessels of the young men were
                                    holy. Now this way is defiled, but it shall also be sanctified this day in the vessels.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 *The priest therefore gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, within

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And David said to Achimelech: Hast thou here at hand a spear, or a

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And the priest said: Lo here is the sword of Goliath, the Philistine,
                                    whom thou slewest in the valley of Terebinth, wrapped up in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take this, take it, for
                                    here there is no other but this. And David said: There is none like that, give it me.</font></p>

                                    to Achis, the king of Geth:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And the servants of Achis, when they saw David, said to him: Is not
                                    this David, the king of the land? Did they not sing to him in their dances, saying: *Saul hath slain his thousands, and David
                                    his ten thousands?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 But David laid up these words in his heart, and was exceedingly afraid
                                    at the face of Achis, the king of Geth.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And he changed his countenance before them, and slipt down between
                                    their hands: and he stumbled against the doors of the gate, and his spittle ran down upon his beard.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And Achis said to his servants: You saw the man <i>was </i>mad: why
