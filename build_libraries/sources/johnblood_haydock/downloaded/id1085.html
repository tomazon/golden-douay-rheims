                           Chap. xxvii. 2. Job had used this expression, but only to intimate that strict justice did not take place, as he thought his
                           faults had not deserved so severe a chastisement. He did not pretend that God was unjust, or that he was quite blameless;
                           and he had so explicitly declared his sentiments, that Eliu could not well be ignorant of them. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           xix. 6., and xxiii. 7. But great deductions must be made from such hyperboles; and he had frequently praised the mercy and
                           justice of God, and his just punishment of the wicked. He had indeed excepted himself from the number; and Eliu ought to have
                           proved that he was wrong in this respect. But he seems to have all along evaded or mistaken the point under dispute. (Calmet)

                           indeed visited by the Lord." (Haydock) --- Eliu wrests Job's words, in order that he may have something to say against him.

                           A hypocrite denotes one infected with all sorts of crimes. (St. Irenæus v. 24.) Such a king is sometimes given to punish a
                           wicked people, Osee xiii. 11., and Isaias iii. 4. This sense is beautiful, and followed by the Chaldean, Septuagint, &amp;c.
                           We may explain the Hebrew in like manner, by neglecting the Masoretic points. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "That the hypocrite
                           reign not, lest the people be ensnared." (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "He overturns the throne of hypocrites, on account of the scandal
                           of the people," or "he delivers the people from servitude." The sense of the Vulgate seems preferable. (Calmet) --- Eliu insinuates
                           that Job had been a hypocrite and an oppressor; but God exculpates him. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           From God all the rights of a father spring, Ephesians iii. 15. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "No indeed: but learn Job, answer
                           not like fools." Protestants, "my desire is, (marginal note, my father) that Job may be tried unto the end, because of <I>his</I>
                           answers for the wicked." (Haydock) --- He has imitated their wicked discourses; let his chastisement deter others. (Calmet)

                           and pressed by arguments. (Menochius) (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "since he adds crime (Calmet; Protestants, rebellion) to his sin,
                           and clappeth <I>his hands</I> among us, and multiplieth his words against the Lord." Eliu concluding that Job was obstinate,
                           (Haydock) invites his friends to join in prayer, that he might be still more severely chastised, to make him enter into himself.
                           Such a strange petition might possibly proceed from charity. But Eliu had given too many proofs of passion, to allow this
                           interpretation. Had he evinced that Job as a criminal? and were not his sorrows already too great, so that he might rather
                           have prayed that God would alleviate them, or grant him more patience?</FONT></P><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>
