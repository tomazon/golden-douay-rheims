                           God made use of the ill-will of the Philistines to punish Saul, and to make way for David to the throne. (Salien) --- Each
                           of the five lords brought their armies into the field, where they were united. Achis, placing the greatest confidence in David,
                           requires his attendance. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           or "can do." Thou wilt be convinced of my valour and fidelity. (Haydock) --- But could David lawfully fight against his brethren?
                           or could he desert Achis in the heat of the engagement? His answer is ambiguous. (Calmet) --- He prudently committed his cause

                           juncture, so that Cajetan blames him unjustly. (Salien; Menochius; Tirinus) --- <I>Guard.</I> Septuagint, "captain of my body

                           had appointed some priests, and had fabricated a fresh ephod, with the Urim, &amp;c., after the departure of Abiathar. (Calmet)
                           --- But Salien calls this in question, and there might neither be priests nor prophets for Saul to consult. (Haydock) ---

                           perfection, so as to deceive the company, and make them think that some one was calling them from a great distance; as was
                           the case with one Farming in England, 1645. (Dickenson, c. 9.) --- Brodeus mentions that the valet of Francis I could thus
                           counterfeit the speech of people deceased, and by these means prevailed upon a rich young woman to marry him, and a banker
                           of Lyons to give him a large sum of money. James Rodoginus, a possessed person in Italy, 1513, could make articulate sounds
                           from the hollow of his belly, when his lips and nostrils were closed up. The oracles of idols were generally given in a low
                           tone, as if they proceeded from the earth. <I>Submissi petimus terram &amp; vox fertur ad aures.</I> (Virgil) --- Those of
                           Apollo were the most famous, and hence a divining spirit is called a <I>Python.</I> Saul must have been stupidly blind, thus
                           to depend on what he had formerly banished with such care. (Calmet) --- He flattered himself that some would still be left,
                           especially among the women, who are most addicted to superstition, as well as to religion. (Menochius) --- <I>Endor</I> was
                           distant from Gelboe about four hours' walk. (Adrichomius) --- But Saul made a long circuit to avoid the enemy. (Salien, v.

                           The Rabbins pretend that she was Abner's mother, (Calmet) which is extremely improbable, as he was of the tribe of Benjamin,
                           and a man of such renown. (Salien) --- Theodoret follows their opinion, in supposing that the woman was startled, because
                           Samuel appeared in a standing posture, and not with his feet upwards, or lying down on his back, as in a coffin, which they
                           say (Calmet) is the usual manner of spirits appearing to people of her character. (Bellarmine, Purgat. ii. 6.) --- She <I>cried

                           (Haydock) in great majesty, or she pretended to see him, the better to impose upon the king; for some think that all was a
                           delusion. (Calmet) --- <I>Saul.</I> This she learnt either from Samuel, (Josephus) or from her familiar spirit. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           that it was Samuel.</I> It is the more common opinion of the holy fathers, and interpreters, that the soul of Samuel appeared
                           indeed; and not, as some have imagined, an evil spirit in his shape. Not that the power of her magic could bring him thither,
                           but that God was pleased for the punishment of Saul, that Samuel himself should denounce unto him the evils that were falling
                           upon him. See Ecclesiasticus xlvi. 23. (Challoner) --- The passage is decisive; (Tirinus) <I>he slept and he made known to
                           the king, and shewed him the end of his life, and he lifted up his voice from the earth, in prophecy,</I> &amp;c. Those who
                           have called in question the reality of Samuel's apparition, seem not to have remembered this passage. (Haydock) --- Yet his
                           soul was not united to his body, (Salien) nor was he adduced by the power of the devil, but (Du Hamel) by a just judgment
                           of God, to denounce destruction to the wicked king. (St. Augustine, &amp;c.) (Tirinus) --- The woman, beholding Samuel, fled
                           out of the place, to Saul's companions, and left him alone with the king, ver. 21. --- <I>Adored</I> Samuel with an inferior
                           honour, as the friend of God, exalted in glory. (Salien) --- That Samuel really appeared, is the more common opinion of the
                           fathers. (St. Augustine, Cura. xv.) (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           To inform a person of something very terrible, is distressing; and though the saints deceased cannot partake in the afflictions
                           of mortals, yet we read that "the angels of peace will weep, but they will approve of the just sentence of the judge" against
                           the reprobate. (Haydock) --- The Scripture language conforms itself to the opinions of the people, who thought that such avocations
                           disturbed the soul's repose. Hence the fathers at [the Synod of] Elvira (Canon xxxi.) forbid "the lighting of wax candles
                           in church-yards during the day, for the spirits of the saints are not to be disquieted." Isaias (xiv. 9,) represents hell
                           all in commotion, at the approach of the king of Babylon. These expressions are figurative. (Calmet) --- God does not encourage
                           magical arts, on this occasion, but rather prevents their operation, as he did, when Balaam would have used some superstitious
                           practices, Numbers xxiv. (Du Hamel)</FONT></P><B>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And Saul said to his servants: Seek me a woman that hath a *divining

                                    at Endor.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 Then he disguised himself: and put on other clothes, and he went, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice, and

                                    and adored.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And Samuel said to Saul: *Why hast thou disturbed my rest, that I
                                    should be brought up? And Saul said: I am in great distress: for the Philistines fight against me, and God is departed from
                                    me, and would not hear me, neither by the hand of prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayst shew
                                    me what I shall do.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And Samuel said: Why askest thou me, seeing the Lord has departed
                                    from thee, and is gone over to thy rival?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 For the Lord will do to thee as he spoke by me, and he will rend thy
                                    kingdom out of thy hand, and will give it to thy neighbour David:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Because thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord, neither didst thou
                                    execute the wrath of his indignation upon Amalec. Therefore hath the Lord done to thee what thou sufferest this day.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And the Lord also will deliver Israel with thee into the hands of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And the woman came to Saul, (for he was very much troubled) and said

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also the voice of thy handmaid,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 But he refused, and said: I will not eat. But his servants and the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she made haste and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And set it before Saul, and before his servants. And when they had
