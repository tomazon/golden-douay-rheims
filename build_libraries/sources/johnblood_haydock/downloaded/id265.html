                           your vain conversation of the tradition of your fathers.</I> St. Peter teacheth what St. Paul repeats in many places, that
                           it was in vain for them to hope to be saved by the ceremonies and precepts of the former law, to which their forefathers had
                           added many unnecessary and groundless traditions. They could only hope for salvation by believing in Christ, by the price
                           of whose precious blood they were redeemed from their sins, as they had heard by the word of the gospel preached to them.
                           His doctrine is the same with that of St. Paul, of St. James, of St. John, and of the other apostles, that to be saved it
                           is not enough to have faith or hope in Christ, but it must be a faith joined and working by charity, obeying the law of Christ
                           in the spirit of charity with a sincere and brotherly love of every one, without setting our hearts upon the vanities and
                           corruptible things of this world, remembering that all flesh is as grass, or the flowers of the field, which wither and pass
                           away in a very short time. Thus presently vanish all riches, honours, pleasures, and all the glory of this life, but the word
                           of God and his promises will bring us to happiness which will last for ever. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>
