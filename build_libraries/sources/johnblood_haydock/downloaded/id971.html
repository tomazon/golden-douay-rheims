                           of Roboam. (Challoner) --- It was the 16th of Asa. We read that Baasa died in the 26th year of Asa, 3 Kings xvi. 8. How then
                           could he fight with him in the 36th? (Tirinus) --- <I>Rama</I> was on an eminence, and commanded the pass below. Baasa wished
                           to cut off all communication with the kingdom of Juda, as he knew many of his subjects had emigrated for the sake of the true
                           religion, chap. xv. 9. (Calmet) --- He had taken the city from the tribe of Benjamin. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B></B>

                           induces the king of Damascus to act perfidiously. (Calmet) --- Otherwise it is not unlawful to make use of the arms of infidels,
                           unless where God has forbidden it. (Grotius, Jur. ii. 15, 9.) (Masius in Jos. ix. 15.) --- David had recourse to Achis, and
                           the Machabees to the Romans. (Calmet) --- Some kings are blamed for making leagues with the princes of Israel, because they
                           had been warned to the contrary; and Asa was severely reprehended, as he had already received such assurances of the divine
                           protection, (chap. xiv. 12., and xv. 7.) that nothing but pusillanimity could have induced him (Haydock) to give away the

                           It seems more natural to read Israel. (Calmet) --- But we must remember that Benadad was an ally of Israel; and if he had
                           not been bribed, he would have come to the assistance of Baasa, (Haydock) and thus both might have fallen a prey to Asa, as

                           explain it (Calmet) of the stocks to enclose the neck. (Vatable) --- <I>Time,</I> either because they expressed the same sentiments

                           gout generally proves fatal. (Cornelius a Lapide) --- Septuagint, "till he was very ill:" (Haydock) a just punishment for
                           his having confined the prophet in fetters; but of a temporal nature, as he sinned through passion, and died penitent, his

                           delight in, (Proverbs vii. 16,) to entice the sensual. (Du Hamel) --- Hebrew <I>zenim,</I> may be derived from <I>zana, fornicari.</I>
                           It denotes a mixture of perfumes. (Menochius) --- But here the Vulgate read <I>zunim.</I> (Du Hamel) --- Hebrew and Septuagint,
                           "they laid him on a bed, and filled it with aromatical spices, and with various sorts of perfumers' ointments, and they made
                           him a very great funeral,<I> or</I> (Haydock) burning." (Protestants) --- It is not clear whether the body was placed on a
                           bed of state, and these perfumes were used to remove every disagreeable smell, or the body itself was rather consumed along
                           with them, a practice which seems to have become more common since the days of Asa, Jeremias xxxiv. 5., 1 Kings xxxi. 12.,
                           and Amos vi. 10. Joram was deprived of this honour, chap. xxi. 19. (Calmet) --- Sanctius adduces many examples, to prove that
                           the spices were burnt only near the body; (Tirinus) and the Hebrews generally preferred to inter the corpse. <I>Corpora condere
