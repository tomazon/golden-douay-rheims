                           history, though different in some circumstances from that related by St. Matthew, chap. viii., is most likely a relation of
                           the same event, and the apparent discrepancies may be easily reconciled. St. Matthew says it was the centurion's boy; St.
                           Luke calls him his servant: but in these terms there is no necessary contradiction. And whereas the former says the centurion
                           went himself to Christ, St. Luke mentions that he sent the ancients, or senators, of the Jews. Here, as in other places, we
                           may suppose, that the former evangelist, for the sake of brevity, attributes to the centurion what was done in his name and
                           with his authority; and through the whole narrative he represents our Saviour answering the centurion as if personally present.

                           St. Luke says that the centurion begs of our Lord to come to him, he must not be supposed to contradict St. Matthew, who says,
                           that the centurion objected he was not worthy to receive him under his roof. St. Luke seems here to relate the words of the
                           Jews, who most probably would stop the centurion as he was going to Christ, and promise to intercede with our Lord for him.
                           (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxvii. in Matt.) --- Some pretend that the centurion, after having sent to Jesus, went himself; but
                           there is no necessity for such a supposition. We see in another case, that the petition of the sons of Zebedee, made by them
                           to Jesus Christ, according to St. Mark (x. 35.) was made to him by the mouth of their mother, according to St. Matthew xx.
                           20. And this the old adage also teaches: <I>qui facit per alium, facit per se;</I> what a man does by another, he does by
                           himself.</FONT></P><B>

                           Christ went with them, not because he could not cure him, when absent, but that he might set forth the centurion's humility

                           of his consequence and riches; but he went to the centurion's servant, that he might appear to despise his humble condition.

                           is a city of Galilee, about two miles from Mount Thabor. It was by divine dispensation, that so very great a multitude was
                           present on this occasion, in order to witness this stupendous miracle. (Ven. Bede) --- The burying-places of the Jews were
                           out of the precincts of the city, as well for the preservation of health as decency. Thus Joseph of Arimathea, had his sepulchre
                           in the rock of Mount Calvary, which was out of the city. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           evangelist seems to relate this miracle, as if it had happened by mere accident; though, beyond a doubt, divine Providence
                           disposed all things to increase the splendour of the miracle. Jesus Christ would not raise this young man to life before he
                           was carried out to be buried, that he might meet him near the gates of the city, where the assembly of the people took place.
                           Besides this, there were present both the multitude that followed Jesus, and the multitude that followed the corpse, to the
                           end that all these might be eye-witnesses to the miracle, and many might praise God, as Ven. Bede remarks. It was very proper
                           that Christ should work this miracle just as he was entering the city, that he might preach the gospel with better success,
                           from the opinion they must form of him, after beholding so great a miracle, and so great a favour bestowed upon them. (Maldonatus)
                           --- In a few words, the evangelist paints to life the affliction of this distressed widowed parent: a mother and a widow,
                           without the least hopes of children, deprived of him who was her only support, the life of her habitation, the source of all
                           her maternal tenderness and satisfaction, now in the prime of health, the only branch of her succession, and the staff of
                           her old age. (St. Gregory of Nyssa, de hominis opificio.)</FONT></P><B>

                           is one of those places upon which modern sectaries lay so much stress, in order to prove that faith alone can save us. But
                           if they will attentively consider the different parts of this history, they will easily discover the fallacy of their argument.
                           Because, before&nbsp;Christ spoke these words: <I>thy faith,</I> &amp;c. he had said to Magdalene: <I>many sins are forgiven
                           her, because she hath loved much.</I> Therefore she was justified not so much through her faith, as her charity: still she
                           had faith, or she would not have come to Jesus, to be delivered from her sins. It was therefore her faith, working by charity,
                           that justified her: and this is the doctrine of the Catholic Church. Nevertheless, she had not that faith, which modern sectaries
                           affirm to be necessary for their justification, viz. a belief that they are already justified, and that their sins are forgiven:
                           this faith the woman here mentioned had not before Christ spoke those words to her; for it was to obtain the remission of
                           her sins, that she performed so many offices of charity, washing his feet with her tears, &amp;c. But is may be asked, why
                           then does Christ attribute her salvation to her faith? The answer is easy, and has often been given, viz. that faith is the
                           beginning of salvation; for it was her faith that brought her to Christ: for had not the woman believed in him, she never
                           would have come to him to obtain the remission of her sins. (Maldonatus)</FONT></P>
