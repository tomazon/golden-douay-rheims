                                    armour, and of harnesses of all sorts.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 Wherefore all men prayed that these prodigies might turn to good.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 Now when there was gone forth a false rumour, as though Antiochus had
                                    been dead, Jason taking with him no fewer than a thousand men, suddenly assaulted the city: and though the citizens ran together
                                    to the wall, the city at length was taken, and Menelaus fled into the castle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 But Jason slew his countrymen without mercy, not considering that prosperity
                                    against one's own kindred, is a very great evil, thinking they had been enemies, and not citizens, whom he conquered.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 Yet he did not get the principality, but received confusion at the
                                    end, for the reward of his treachery, and fled again into the country of the Ammonites.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 At the last, having been shut up by Aretas, the king of the Arabians,
                                    in order for his destruction, flying from city to city, hated by all men, as a forsaker of the laws, and execrable, as an
                                    enemy of his country and countrymen, he was thrust out into Egypt:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And he that had driven many out of their country, perished in a strange
                                    land, going to Lacedemon, as if for kindred sake he should have refuge there:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 But he that had cast out many unburied, was himself cast forth both
                                    unlamented and unburied, neither having foreign burial, nor being partaker of the sepulchre of his fathers.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 Now when these things were done, the king suspected that the Jews
                                    would forsake the alliance: whereupon departing out of Egypt with a furious mind, he took the city by force of arms,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And commanded the soldiers to kill, and not to spare any that came
                                    in their way, and to go up into the houses to slay.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 Thus there was a slaughter of young and old, a destruction of women
                                    and children, and killing of virgins and infants.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And there were slain in the space of three whole days fourscore thousand,
                                    forty thousand were made prisoners, and as many sold.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 But this was not enough; he presumed also to enter into the temple,
                                    the most holy in all the world, Menelaus, that traitor to the laws, and to his country, being his guide.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And taking in his wicked hands the holy vessels, which were given
                                    by other kings and cities, for the ornament and the glory of the place, he unworthily handled and profaned them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Thus Antiochus going astray in mind, did not consider that God was
                                    angry for a while, because of the sins of the inhabitants of the city: and therefore this contempt had happened to the place:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Otherwise had they not been involved in many sins, *as Heliodorus,
                                    who was sent by king Seleucus to rob the treasury, so this man also, as soon as he had come, had been forthwith scourged,
                                    and put back from his presumption.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 But God did not choose the people for the place's sake, but the place
                                    for the people's sake.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And therefore, the place also itself was made partaker of the evils
                                    of the people: but afterwards shall communicate in the good things thereof, and as it was forsaken in the wrath of&nbsp; Almighty
                                    God, shall be exalted again with great glory, when the great Lord shall be reconciled.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 So when Antiochus had taken away out of the temple a thousand and
                                    eight hundred talents, he went back in all haste to Antioch, thinking through pride, that he might now make the land navigable,
                                    and the sea passable on foot: such was the haughtiness of his mind.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 He left also governors to afflict the people: at Jerusalem, Philip,
                                    a Phrygian by birth, but in manners more barbarous than he that set him there:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And in Garizim, Andronicus and Menelaus, who bore a more heavy hand
                                    upon the citizens than the rest.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And whereas he was set against the Jews, he sent that hateful prince,
                                    Apollonius, with an army of two and twenty thousand men, commanding him to kill all that were of perfect age, and to sell
                                    the women and the younger sort.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 Who, when he was come to Jerusalem, pretending peace, rested till
                                    the holy day of the sabbath: and then the Jews keeping holiday, he commanded his men to take arms.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And he slew all that were come forth to see: and running through the
                                    city with armed men, he destroyed a very great multitude.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 But Judas Machabeus, who was the tenth, had withdrawn himself into
                                    a desert place, and there lived amongst wild beasts in the mountains with his company: and they continued feeding on herbs,
                                    that they might not be partakers of the pollution.</font></p>
