                           captivity, of riches," &amp;c., means a captive or a rich man. (Calmet) --- God spoke such words to David as tended to promote
                           solid virtue and piety. (Haydock) --- We may explain <I>the ruler,</I> &amp;c., of the Messias, who shall diffuse grace and

                           But is this sense? Is not the sun the light of the morning? The oldest Hebrew manuscript in England has the word <I>Jehova</I>
                           before <I>Sun,</I> which seems to have been acknowledged by the Septuagint, though now unintelligible; and thus we are freed
                           from this difficulty, and the passage is proved to be prophetical of the great sun of justice, Malachias iv. 2., and Isaias
                           lx. 2. (Kennicott, Dis. i., p. 471.) --- The Hebrew is extremely obscure. (Calmet) --- Protestants, And <I>he shall be</I>

                           out of the earth by clear shining after rain. (Haydock) --- These comparisons may be applied to the Psalms and other inspired
                           writings, which enlighten the eyes; (Psalm xviii. 9,) or to Christ, whose glory surpasses that of the sun, (Psalm lxxi. 5,)
                           and whose graces produce the just, Isaias xlv. 8. (Menochius) --- We might expect that David was going to compare the glory
                           of his reign and of his family, with that of the rising sun, Judges v. 31. But he does not finish the comparison, being filled
                           with a sense of his own misery. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           my house, through his blessing, have sprung up, and succeeded in all things. (Challoner) --- He clearly distinguishes between
                           the covenant made with him as to his earthy kingdom, and that which regards Christ. (Worthington) --- Even the former should
                           be of long duration, Psalm cxxxi. 11. (Haydock) --- <I>Up.</I> Hebrew seems to contradict all that had gone before; "for it
                           shall not flourish." (Calmet) --- Protestants, "although he make <I>it</I> not to grow;" (Haydock) unless we read with an
                           interrogation, "And shall not my family flourish?" which was a natural reverence to ver. 4. (Calmet) --- God had blessed David
                           with the dew of heaven, and with the fatness of the earth. (Menochius) --- His glory and happiness should not be of short

                           the son of Hachamoni. For this was the name of this hero, as appears from 1 Chronicles xi. 11. (Challoner) --- But then <I>sitting,</I>
                           &amp;c., should not be retained. (Haydock) --- <I>Most tender,</I> &amp;c. He appeared like one tender and weak, but was indeed
                           most valiant and strong. It seems the Latin has here given the interpretation of the Hebrew name of the hero, to whom <I>Jesbaham</I>
                           was like, instead of the name itself, which was <I>Adino</I> the <I>Eznite,</I> one much renowned of old for his valour. (Challoner)
                           --- The Vulgate has, contrary to custom, translated many of the proper names. (Calmet) --- The French version would suppose
                           that Adino, the Heznite, was the hero's name; and queen Elizabeth's version (1599) is, "He that sat in the seat of wisdom,
                           being chief of the princes, was Adino, the Eznite." (Haydock) --- But no such person is mentioned any where else, in the Bible;
                           and these words have been corrupted, like many others in this chapter, as may be gathered from collating it with Chronicles,
                           &amp;c. Kennicott was encouraged to continue, if not to begin his labours, to shew the imperfection of the printed Hebrew,
                           by comparing these passages, though he had formerly imagined that the text had been preserved in its original purity. See
                           Diss. ii. p. 496. He shews the inaccuracy of queen Elizabeth's version, and observes that some have very abruptly inferred,
                           that David was the first of his own mighty men, from the Vulgate, which is literally, "These are the names of the valiant
                           men of David. Sitting in the chair, the most wise prince among the three. The same is like the most tender," &amp;c. No name
                           is here specified, (Haydock) though the catalogue be given expressly to honour their names. --- <I>In the chair.</I> Hebrew
                           <I>Bashebeth, </I>"seems to be carelessly transcribed in here from the line above," as <I>Oregim</I> was taken from the subsequent
                           line, chap. xxi. 19. --- <I>Wisest.</I> Hebrew, "the Hachmonite." --- <I>Three;</I> it is in Hebrew, "the third;" and in Chronicles
                           <I>thirty,</I> improperly. Protestants, "the Tachmonite, that sat in the seat, chief among the captains, (the same was Adino,
                           the Eznite) against 800 whom he slew at one time," is therefore inaccurate. --- <I>Tachmonite</I> has the <I>th</I> corrupted,
                           from <I>e,</I> which stands for <I>ben,</I> "<I>the son</I> of Hachmoni;" though, as the father of Jashobeam was Zadiel, it
                           would be better rendered the Hachmonite, being his family or local name. It is not always possible to know which is meant.
                           The ellipsis in the Protestant version, and the confounding of Jashobeam with Adino, cannot be excused. <I>Adinu</I> seems
                           to be (Haydock) corrupted from <I><I><FONT size=3>á</I></FONT>uror,</I> (as ver. 18, and 1 Paralipomenon) "lifted up;" <I>eatsnu,</I>
                           a word retained in the Arabic language, for "his spear;" (Vulgate) <I>wood.</I> Le Clerc reads <I>eatsni,</I> which he deems
                           inexplicable, no less than <I>Adinu:</I> but the best copies have <I>eatsnu;</I> so that we need not reject it. --- <I>Killed,</I>
                           or "wounded," is the general interpretation of <I>elol;</I> but it signifies also, "a soldier." --- <I>Eight</I> is <I>three,</I>
                           in Paralipomenon. Similar mistakes have probably arisen from the use of numeral letters. See 4 Kings viii. 26. We read, that
                           <I>Abisai lifted up his spear against</I> 300. This was, perhaps, an usual number for a regiment of three companies, 1 Kings
                           xxix. 2. Both Jesbahan and Abisai ventured to contend, singly, with so superior a force; but the latter displayed rather less
                           valour, so that he did not attain unto the glory of the former; which he ought to have done, if both had killed the same number.
                           Kennicott would therefore translate, "These are the names of the mighty men, whom David had: Jashobeam, the Hachmonite, chief
                           of the Three: He lifted up his spear against 300 soldiers, at one time." He observes that thirty-seven heroes are particularly
                           specified: (ver. 39) Joab, (the captain-general) Jashobeam, Eleazar, Shammah, (the first ternary) Abishai, Benaiah, and Asael;
                           (the second ternary) after whom follow thirty, whose exploits are not recorded. If any should still maintain that this verse
                           is correct, we must say (Haydock) that Adino is a different person from Jesbaham, (as the Vulgate reads it, 1 Paralipomenon)
                           and that he killed 800; whereas the latter was only <I>like</I> him, in as much as he slew 300. (Menochius) --- The marvellous
                           is greatly diminished by substituting 300 instead of 800, and by allowing that the heroes contended with, though they might
                           not kill, the whole company of 300 soldiers. See Kennicott. It seems most rational to admit some corrections, to which we
                           are led by the Septuagint, "Jesbaath, (Vatican, Jesbosthe, the Chanaanite) the son of Thakemoni. He was the chief of the three.
                           <I>Adino, the Asonean,</I> is useless, (Calmet) as a proper name: when corrected, it is rendered, (Haydock) "he drew," &amp;c.
                           Whence have they taken this, as it is not in Hebrew at present, unless they read, (Calmet) <I><I><FONT size=3>á</I></FONT>uror,
                           elevavit,</I> "he lifted up his spear." (Kennicott) --- The number of 300 slain by one man, in one engagement, is also more
                           credible than 800. (Calmet) --- Josephus increases the number to 900; but then he supposes they were slain in various battles.
                           "The king had thirty-eight, chiefly renowned for their achievements....The first, Issaimos, the son of Achamani, who rushing,
                           not once, but frequently, into the midst of the enemy, did not cease from slaughtering till he had killed 900." We may observe
                           that he increases the number of the mighty men. (Haydock) --- Delany reduces it to thirty-six, though he afterwards reckons
                           thirty-seven, erroneously making thirty-one commanders of the third order, when he ought to have allowed the odd one to be
                           the captain-general, and placed him before the two ternaries. Lightfoot also reckons thirty-six, and mentions them in this
                           remarkably false order: 1, Joab; 2, Adino, of Ezni, called Jashobeam, by office; 3, Eleazar. And in the second rank: 1, Abishai;
                           2, Shammah; 3, Benaiah. (Kennicott) --- All these officers were styled, <I>Shalischim.</I> See Exodus xiv. 7. (Calmet) ---
                           A body of "Thirty" was, perhaps, originally formed by David; and, though he afterwards admitted a greater number, they all
                           went by the first name. (Salien)</FONT></P><B>

                           precision as it had been already done. (Kennicott) --- Asael was slain by Abner, chap. ii. 23. He was captain of the fourth
                           band, 1 Paralipomenon xxvii. 7. --- <I>Elehanan,</I> the first of the thirty. --- <I>Dodo.</I> Literally, <I>patrui ejus,</I>
                           "of his (Asael's) uncle," which might, perhaps, be as well translated as 1 Paralipomenon xi. 26. See chap. xxi. 19. The Septuagint
                           give both, "Dodei, the son of his father's brother," as ver. 9; (Haydock) or "rather those two translations are by some transcriber,
                           or editor, injudiciously thrown together." (Kennicott)</FONT></P><B>

                           introduced a new mode of pronunciation, and that it has been adopted by the Protestants, so that it is almost impossible to
                           recognize in their work the scriptural names of the most ancient versions of the Septuagint and Vulgate. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>
