                           and death of his Son; that having decreed to bring many sons, or <I>children,</I> to eternal glory, he was pleased to send
                           his divine Son to become man, and so to consummate the <I>Author</I>[3] of man's <I>salvation by suffering;</I> i.e. to make
                           him a perfect and consummate sacrifice of expiation for the sins of all men, and to satisfy the justice of God in the most
                           perfect manner. (Witham) --- By <I>suffering,</I> Christ was to enter into his glory, (Luke xxiv. 26.) which the apostle here
                           calls being made perfect. (Challoner) --- In this and the above verses we may observe three different states of Jesus Christ.
                           The first, that of his humiliation by his passion and death; the second, that of his glory at his resurrection and ascension
                           into heaven; the third, that of his consummated glory in heaven after the last judgment. In his first state, viz. his passion,
                           he was made not only less than the Angels, but as the last of men; novissimus virorum. In his second, all power was given
                           to him in heaven and earth; but this power he will not fully exercise till after the general judgment, when all things, without
                           exception, will be made subject to him; and this is the third state, the permanent state of his glory, which is never to end.
