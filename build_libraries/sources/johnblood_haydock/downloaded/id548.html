                           Josue was now 100 years old. He lived ten more, (Calmet) having governed the people in all 17. (Haydock) --- During the first
                           seven years, he had performed all that could be expected from an able general, and he probably designed to conquer the whole
                           country before he divided it. But God, who chose to leave some of the ancient inhabitants in the country, to try the fidelity
                           of his people, &amp;c., ordered him to proceed to the distribution, that the different tribes might take care to exterminate
                           those idolaters, who might be found in their territory. --- <I>Lot.</I> Hebrew, "to be possessed." Only the country east of
                           the Jordan was yet divided.</FONT></P><B>

                           As Josue had been making such conquests in that part lately, some would translate <I>Geliloth,</I> "the confines" of the Philistines,
                           in which sense it seems to be taken, chap. xviii. 18., and xxii. 10. (Calmet) --- Bonfrere suspects that St. Jerome wrote
                           <I>Galila.</I> --- <I>Gessuri,</I> either near Mount Hermon, (Menochius) or bordering upon Arabia, 1 Kings xv., and xxvii.

                           Hebrew, "from the <I>Shicor,</I> (or <I>Sichor</I>) which is on the face, (or over-against) Egypt." Jeremias (ii. 18,) informs
                           us that this river was <I>in Egypt</I> which is not true of the torrent of Rhinocorure; which the Septuagint and many commentators,
                           understand in this place to be the boundary fixed for the promised land. Strabo, &amp;c., attribute that torrent to Ph&#339;nicia;
                           which they extend as far as Pelusium. St. Jerome (in Amos vi.) seems dubious whether the branch of the Nile passes by that
                           city, or the aforesaid torrent be meant. David collected all his forces from the Sichor, or the torrent of Egypt, to the entrance
                           of Emath, 1 Paralipomenon xiii. 5. Epiphanes constituted Lysanias governor of all the countries between the Euphrates and
                           the river of Egypt, (2 Machabees iii. 32,) and he undoubtedly had extended his conquests as far as the Nile. Though the country
                           beyond Gaza be now mostly barren, and therefore little inhabited or noticed, yet the Israelites were entitled to assert their
                           right to it, as they seem to have done by taking possession of Gosen, chap. x. 41. Some parts were formerly well peopled,
                           1 Kings xxvii. 8. It is not unusual for the Nile, and other great rivers, to be styled torrents. The Hebrew <I><I><FONT size=3>n</FONT><FONT

                           to rivers, Ecclesiastes i. 7. The <I>troubled</I> state in which the waters of the Nile generally appear, is very remarkable,
                           as their taste is most excellent. The natives have discovered a method of rendering them clear, by the mixture of almond powder.
                           The names of this river bear some relation to the Hebrew term which is here used. It was formerly called <FONT size=3>Siris;
                           and the star, which rose when it overflowed, received the name of&nbsp;</FONT>Sirius. The Ethiopians style it Schichri. Another
                           name was Melas, or Egyptus, denoting "blackness." The people of the country idolized this river, because it supplied the want
                           of rain. (Tibul, i. 8.) (Calmet) --- <I>Accaron,</I> the most northern city of the Philistian principalities, (Haydock) attributed
                           to Juda or Dan, though neither held it for any length of time. Beelzebub was chiefly adored here, 4 Kings i. 2. --- <I>Lords,</I>
                           who seem to have been independent. They are styled <I>Sornim,</I> as the next in dignity to the king of Persia was a <I>Surena.</I>
                           (Marcellin. 24.) The Philistines took this country from the Chanaanites, or Eveans, (Calmet) who are a different people from
                           the Hevites. (Bochart)</FONT></P><B>

                           The Israelites were satisfied with what they had already conquered. (Menochius) --- But herein they deserved blame, as they
