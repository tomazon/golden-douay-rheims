                           <i>Hiram.</i> Josephus says, that the temple was built in the 11th year of this prince. He must therefore have been the son
                           of David's friend, as the former had sent artificers to build David's house, (2 Kings v. 11.; Calmet) above 30 years before.
                           But there may be a mistake in the number, as the Scripture evidently speaks of the same king; and Josephus had said before,
                           "Hiram rejoiced exceedingly that Solomon had succeeded to the throne; (for he had been the friend of David) and he sent ambassadors
                           to congratulate with him on his present felicity, by whom Solomon wrote," &amp;c. The mutual letters of these kings were still
                           preserved in the archives of Tyre; and this author confidently appeals to them, as he deems it "impious to insert any fiction"
                           in his history. (Josephus, Antiquities viii. 2.) He quotes Dius and Menander; who asserted, that these princes proposed enigmas
                           to each other; and that Hiram was obliged to pay a large sum of money, as he could not explain that which Solomon had proposed,
                           &amp;c. (Josephus, contra Apion i.) (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           chap. ix. 19. The cedar-trees grow chiefly towards Phenicia, above Biblos. They bear a great resemblance with fir-trees, and
                           grow in a pyramidical form. The wood is hard and bitter, so that worms will not molest it. Hence it was much used in the temple

                           the God of Israel, as he supposed that there was a god for each nation. See chap. xx. 28., and 4 Kings xvii. 27. (Calemt)

                           The devil will be satisfied, if he can share the divine honours: but God will admit of no rival, nor can he sanction any but
