                           by degrees. They had been apprised of the injustice done to Samson, and did not strive to hinder it, so that they all deserved

                           and Lamentations v. 15. (Menochius) --- Hence many places received the name of <i>Sual,</i> Josue xv. 28., and xix. 42. Pompey
                           exhibited 600 lions at Rome, and the Emperor Probus 5000 ostriches, and as many wild boars, &amp;., in the theatre. (Vopisc.;
                           Pliny [Natural History?] viii. 16.; Cornelius a Lapide) --- Is it more incredible that Samson should collect 300 foxes? By
                           this means he cleared his country of a pernicious animal, the most proper for carrying flambeaux, and spreading fire far and
                           wide among the fields of the enemy. By tying the foxes together, he hindered them from retiring into their holes, and gave
                           the fire time to take hold of the corn and vineyards. (Calmet) --- Ovid mentions a Roman custom of burning foxes in the theatre,
                           with torches tied upon their backs, in the month of April; which some have imagined was in memorial of this transaction. (Serarius,

                           the victory to his own strength, was thus punished. But others are more favourable to the hero, (Calmet) and suppose that
                           his thirst was occasioned by the extraordinary fatigue. He sufficiently testifies that he had received all from God, (Menochius)
