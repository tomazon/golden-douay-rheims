                           the words of God, chap. xxxviii. 2. Each of my friends has only rendered the ways of Providence more obscure, and I myself
                           have not perfectly understood them. (Haydock) --- <i>Unwisely.</i> See chap. xxxix. 35. (Worthington) (Du Hamel) --- Hebrew,
                           "without knowledge, things wonderful to me, which I knew not." (Haydock) --- Now I comprehend that thou didst not afflict
                           me, but hast given me into the hands of the enemy, as thou wilt hereafter do others of the greatest virtue, that their patience

                           accuse himself of any sin or false assertion, but acknowledges his infirmity in not having understood this before, ver. 6.
                           (Houbigant) --- Septuagint, "I have been told what I knew not, things great and wonderful, of which I was not apprized." (Haydock)

                           But all now agree that he only enlightened his understanding, and made known his designs more clearly. (Calmet) --- Job now
                           perceived that he had spoken too boldly, in saying, Hear, and I will speak, &amp;c., ver. 4. The rest of this book is in prose.

                           <i>Reprehend.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "vilify." (Haydock) --- I recall the obscure expression which has occasioned my friends
                           to mistake. (Du Hamel) --- <i>Penance.</i> Hebrew, "groan." Septuagint, "pine away, I look upon myself as dust and ashes."
                           Such are the sentiments which every one will entertain the nearer he approaches to the divine Majesty. (Haydock) --- I no
                           longer assert my innocence, but wait patiently in my present forlorn condition, till thou shalt be pleased to dispose of me.
                           How much would the reputation and authority of Job sink, if some of his assertions had been destitute of truth, particularly
                           as the sacred author does not mention which they were! But God exculpates his servant, ver. 8. (Houbigant) --- Chaldean, "I
                           have despised my riches, and I am comforted with respect to my children, who are now reduced to dust and ashes." I find a
                           consolation in submitting patiently to my sufferings, which I may have deserved on account of my unguarded speeches. (Calmet)
                           --- Job waits not for God's answer, ver. 4. He at once feels an interior light, and is resigned. (Haydock) --- He had defended
                           the truth against men: now, with more resignation, he is content to suffer, and does penance for himself and others. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Two friends.</i> It is astonishing that Eliu is not also reprehended, as he was no better than the rest. Some answer, that
                           God had passed sentence upon him first. Others maintain, that he spoke with greater dignity of God's judgments, and that his
                           ignorance was blameless; while others remark, that he was connected with some of the three friends, or only came accidentally
                           to enter into the debate. God gives sentence in favour of Job, though with some reproof for his manner of speaking. --- <i>As.</i>
                           They had maintained false doctrines, and shewed a want of due respect and compassion for their friend; (Tirinus) whereas Job's
                           assertions were true. (Calmet) --- How then can he be accused of denying the divine justice, or of speaking disrespectfully
                           of Providence? God seemed to interrogate him on this account, though he approved of his sentiments, because some might draw
                           such inferences from his words as all his friends did. But Job entertained no such ideas. He was not guilty of such <i>folly,</i>
                           ver. 8. Septuagint, "Thou hast sinned, and thy two friends, for you have spoken in my presence nothing true like my servant
                           Job."</font></p><b>

                           <i>Offer.</i> Septuagint, "Thou shalt make an oblation, <i><u>karpoma</u>,</i> for you." (Haydock) --- Yet holocausts seem
                           to have been the only species of sacrifice before Moses. The number seven, has always been in a manner sacred; (Calmet) being
                           doubled, it shews the greatness of the offence. (St. Gregory) (Worthington) --- Job was to present these victims to God, (Calmet)
                           as the priest and mediator, (Du Hamel) of whom God approved. He officiated for his family, (Calmet) and was the most honourable
                           person there. (Haydock) --- It seems Job was not present when God gave this injunction; perhaps some time after their debates.
                           (Calmet) --- <i>Pray.</i> Behold the efficacy of the prayers of the saints, even while upon earth. How much greater will it
                           be, when their charity is greater and unfailing! (Haydock) --- The many sacrifices would not have sufficed, if Job had not
                           joined his prayer, as St. Chrysostom (or 5 con. Jud&#339;os) observes. His mediation did not derogate from God's mercy, under
                           the law of nature; not does that of other men injure Christ's, under the law of grace, 2 Corinthians i. 11. We have here also
                           a proof that both sacrifice and the devotion of the offerer, have their distinct effects; <i>opus operatum,</i> and <i>opus
                           operantis,</i> as the schoolmen speak. Thus Job was honourably acquitted, while his friends were justly rebuked. Eliu needed
                           no express condemnation; as what God says to one, must be applied to another in the same circumstances, chap. xxxiii. 14.
                           Protestants are therefore inexcusable, who preach a doctrine not only condemned in their fellows, Luther, &amp;c., but long
                           before in ancient heretics: as the justification by faith alone was in the apostles' time, the rejection of ceremonies in
                           baptism, of confirmation and penance, in the Novatians, &amp;c. See St. Cyprian iv. ep. 2. (Worthington) --- <i>Face.</i>
                           Septuagint, "For I would not accept his face, and if it were not on his account, I had surely destroyed you. For you have
                           not said to me any thing good (Roman Septuagint, <i>true,</i>) against (or concerning, <i><u>kata</u>,</i>) my servant Job."
                           They acted both against charity and truth. (Haydock) --- <i>Before.</i> Protestants, "of me <i>the thing which is</i> right."
                           The words underlined were not so in the earlier edition by Barker, printer to James I, (1613) where some of the margin translations
                           are also omitted, ver. 14, &amp;c. The matter is of no farther consequence, than to shew that alterations have taken place
                           since the days of James I, whose Bible is supposed to be the standard of the English Church. The marginal version is also
                           frequently neglected altogether, (the year of our Lord 1706) though the authors seem to have looked upon it as equally <i>probable</i>
                           with that in the text. (Pref.) (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           well live twice as long as he had done, if we suppose that he was about (Haydock) 50 when he was so much distressed (Petau);

                           change for the better. They helped to restore him to affluence, in conformity with the will of God, who caused their presents
                           of multiply. The kindred and friends of Job were undoubtedly numerous. (Haydock) --- <i>Ewe.</i> Kesita, "lamb," as most of
                           the ancients agree, (Spanheim) or a piece of money, (Bochart) marked with the figure of a lamb. (Grotius) See Genesis xxxiii.

                           (Haydock) --- Oleaster supposes that the nose was perforated, like the ear. But the ornament would thus be very inconvenient,
                           and we may rather conclude that it hung down from the forehead upon the nose. (St. Jerome, in Ezechiel xvi.) (Pineda)</font></p><b>

                           that she only lived that space of time. (Haydock) --- Authors are much divided about the length of Job's life. Some suppose
                           that he was afflicted with the leprosy at the age of 70, for several months, (Tirinus) or for a whole year, (Calmet) or for
                           seven, (Salien) and that he lived twice as long after his re-establishment, in all 210. (Calmet) (Tirinus) Septuagint, "Job
                           lived after his chastisement 170," (Grabe substitutes 140 years. Then he marks with an obel as redundant) "but all the years
                           which he lived were 248;" and adds from Theodition, "And Job saw his sons and their children, <i>even</i> the fourth generation."
                           (Haydock) --- The old Vulgate had also 248 years; while some Greek copies read 740. But Grotius thinks the life of Job was
                           not extended beyond 200. Petau and Spanheim say 189, (Calmet) and Pindea 210, or rather 280, years. Yet the life of man, in
                           the days of Moses, his contemporary, was not often longer than 120; so that if we allow Job 140, he would be an old man, and
                           might see the fourth generation, ver. 10. (Haydock) --- The Greeks celebrate his festival on the 6th, the Latins on the 10th
                           of May. (Pineda) --- <i>Days.</i> Here a long addition is found in the Greek, Arabic, and old Vulgate; and Theodotion has
                           also inserted it in his version, as it seems to contain a true and ancient tradition, (see Eusebius, præp. ix. 25.) though
                           the Fathers have properly distinguished it from the inspired text. It stands thus in the Alexandrian Septuagint with an obel
                           prefixed: "But it is written, that he shall be raised again, with those whom the Lord will restore <i>to life.</i>" He, this
                           man, as it is translated from the Syriac book, lived in the land of Ausites, (Hus.) on the borders of Idumea, and of Arabia,
                           and was before called Jobab. But marrying an Arabian woman, he begot a son by name Ennon. But his father was Zareth, a descendant
                           of the sons of Esau, and his mother was Bossora; (Arabic, a native of Bosra) so that he was the 5th (Arabic, the 6th) from
                           Abraham. Now these were the kings who reigned in Edom; over which country he also ruled. First, Balac, <i>son</i> of Semphor;
                           (others have <i>Beor</i>) and the name of his city was Dennaba. After Balak, Jobab, who is called Job. After him, Assom, a
                           leader from the country of Theman. After this man, Adad, son of Barad, who slew Madian in the plain of Moab; and the name
                           of his city was Gethaim. But the friends who came to him <i>were,</i> Eliphaz, <b>[</b>son of Sophan<b>]</b> of the sons of
                           Esau, king of the Themanites; Baldad, <b>[</b>son of Amnon, of Chobar<b>]</b> of the Auchite tyrant; (Grabe substitutes the
                           tyrant of the Saucheans, as they call our Suhites) Sophar, king of the Mineans." What is marked with crotchets, (Haydock)
                           has been probably taken from Theodotion. See the Greek Catena. What follows occurs in the Alexandrian manuscript. (Calmet)
                           --- "<b>[</b>Theman, son of Eliphaz, he, as the Syriac book is rendered, lived in the land of Ausites, on the borders of the
                           Euphrates. His former name was Jobab, but Zareth was his father, from the sun rising."<b>]</b> <i>or</i> eastern country.
                           (Haydock) --- Job might very well be the 5th or 6th from Abraham, if he were a contemporary with Moses, as Levi and Amram
                           would live at the same time with Rahuel and Zare; (See 1 Paralipomenon i. 35, 44.) so that this tradition agrees with history.
                           But what is said of the Syriac version is not so certain. (Calmet) --- Some think the Syriac or Arabic was the original text,
                           as the Greek seems to indicate, <i><u>outos ermeneuetai ek tes Suriakes Biblou, en men ge katoikon</u>,</i> &amp;c. The passage
                           at the end, where this is repeated, may be an interpolation, as the latter part seems rather to belong to Job. For how could
                           Theman have both Eliphaz and Zareth for his <i>father?</i> Grabe therefore, marks it as such. It would be too long for us
                           to transcribe (Haydock) the praises which the Fathers have given to Job, and the resemblance which they have discovered between
                           him and Jesus Christ. See Hebrews iv. 15 and xiii. 12.; Tertullian, patient.; St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxiv. in Matt. St. Ambrose,
                           in Psalm xxxvii. 21., observes, that his behaviour on the dunghill was the greatest condemnation of satan, who fell by pride,
                           though so highly favoured. (Calmet) --- Besides the literal sense of this book, which displays the trials and victories of
                           Job, we may consider him as a lively figure of Christ; who was perfectly innocent, and yet a man of sorrows: we may raise
                           our minds to the contemplation of the greater glory which will attend the bodies of the just, after the resurrection; and,
                           above all, we may discover lessons of morality, enforcing the observance of every virtue, and particularly of patience and
                           resignation. (St. Gregory, &amp;c.) (Worthington) --- The books of Machabees, which are the only remaining pieces of sacred
                           history, might have been here inserted, as they are in Calmet's edition, that so all the historical part might come together.
                           But it is more common to place those books after the prophets. They only relate a few of the transactions which took place
                           during the 400 or 500 years preceding the Christian era. The rest must be borrowed from Josephus, or from profane authors.
                           It would, however, be proper to read those books, and to have an idea of that period, before we attempt to explain the prophecies.
