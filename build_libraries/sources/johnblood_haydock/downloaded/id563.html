                           the sins of his people. In the Hebrew it is <i>shignoth:</i> which some take to signify a musical instrument, or tune, with
                           which this sublime prayer and canticle was to be sung. (Challoner) --- The term is omitted in several Latin manuscripts. The
                           precise import cannot be ascertained; yet it seems to imply a song of comfort. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "with a canticle."
                           (Haydock) --- St. Jerome follows Aquila and Symmachus, and the 5th edition. Theodotion has, "for voluntary" transgressions.
                           (Calmet) --- All sins proceed in some degree from ignorance, (Worthington) and are all the effects of free-will. (Haydock)
                           --- The prophet prays to be freed from sin, and foretells the coming of Christ, &amp;c. (Worthington) --- The Fathers apply
                           this canticle to Him, as the Church herself does in her office. We cannot go astray, following such guides. Yet some think
                           that an allusion is made to the return from captivity, and from Egypt, which were noble figures of the world's redemption.
                           The prophet concludes with adoring the ways of God, (Calmet) which at first he had not comprehended. (Haydock) --- He is astonished
                           at God's mercy, in becoming incarnate for man's sake. (Worthington)</font></p><b style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica,

                           --- I saw that the unjust would not escape. (Calmet) --- <i>Work.</i> The great work of the redemption of man, which thou
                           wilt <i>bring to life</i> and light <i>in the midst of the years,</i> when our calamities and miseries shall be at their height.
                           (Challoner) --- <i>Years,</i> at the time appointed. (Worthington) --- Septuagint read, "Lord, I considered thy works, and
                           was astonished; in the midst of two living creatures, <i>or</i> lives, thou shalt be known," (Haydock) or found, between an
                           ox and an ass, as the Church has it. (Nat. and Circumc.[Nativity and Circumcision?]) (Worthington) --- Christ appeared when
                           the world was most dissolute. (Menochius) --- The tradition of two animals being near the crib where he was born, is not of
                           earlier date than about the fifth century. Some explain this of the Father between the Son and the Holy Ghost; others of Christ
                           between the thieves, or the two testaments, or collecting his Church from Jews and Gentiles, &amp;c. (Sanct.; Calmet) ---
                           Moderns agree with St. Jerome's version. The prophet begs that God would perform his ancient miracles in his days, (Calmet)
                           by relieving the captives, as he had formerly delivered their ancestors. (Haydock) --- <i>Make.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint,
                           "when the years approach, thou shalt be made known; when the time shall come, thou shalt be manifested; when my soul shall
                           be troubled, in wrath thou," &amp;c. (Haydock) --- God never shuts the gate of mercy to the penitent, Nahum i. 3. (Calmet)</font></p><b

                           (Worthington) --- The term seems to denote a pause. There might be many in the same canticle, (Calmet) as we find three here,
                           (ver. 9, 13) and many placed at irregular distances in the Psalms. (Haydock) --- The Hebrews had long sojourned in the Stony
                           Arabia, under the guidance of the Lord. We should render in the past time to ver. 16. (Calmet). --- Christ was born (Haydock)
                           at Bethlehem, to the south of Jerusalem, (Worthington) and had given the law, as a Jew interpreted this passage to St. Jerome.
                           He was probably a convert. (Haydock)</font></p><b style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;

                           hidden,</i> by which he overcame the world, and drove out <i>death</i> and <i>the devil.</i> (Challoner) --- Horns may also
                           designate the nails, the prints of which remained in our Saviour's hands after his glorious resurrection. (Haydock) --- God
                           appeared hurling his thunderbolts (ver. 11., and Psalm xvii. 16.; Calmet) with a <i>fiery law in his right hand,</i> all shining
                           with glory, Exodus xix. 18., and xxxiv. 29., and Deuteronomy v. 22. (Haydock) --- Sinai seemed to be all on fire. Nothing

                           by the Septuagint and Theo.[Theodotion?]; "the plague," by Aquila, &amp;c. After Christ was baptized, the devil came to tempt

                           and to reduce them to nothing. For all heaven and earth disappear when they come before his light, Apocalypse xx. 11. (Challoner)
                           --- The Chanaanites were dismayed at the approach of God's people. He routed the nations, and determined the portion which
                           he had chosen for Israel, Josue ii. 9. (Calmet) --- <i>Mountains.</i> By the <i>mountains</i> and <i>hills</i> are signified
                           the great ones of the world, that persecute the Church, whose power was quickly crushed by the Almighty. (Challoner) --- The
                           roughest roads in the wilderness were made smooth. God is poetically described at the head of his people, Deuteronomy viii.
