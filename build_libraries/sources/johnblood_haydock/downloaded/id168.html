                           concerning.</I> The heads of the Church of Corinth had written to St. Paul, desiring to know whether he thought it more expedient
                           to marry or not. This was a question which the sages of antiquity had frequently taken into consideration. To this question
                           St. Paul here delivers his opinion. (Calmet) --- Others, with greater probability, suppose the chief question proposed to
                           St. Paul was, whether they were not bound, upon their conversion, to abstain from their infidel wives. (St. Jerome, cont.
                           Jovin. chap. iv.; St. Chrysostom, on this location, hom. xix.) --- To this he answers in ver. 12. and 13. --- <I>It is good.</I>
                           That is, according to the style of the Scriptures, <I>it is better,</I> if we consider the advantage of every particular,

                           But <I>because of fornication, let every man have,</I> and live with <I>his own wife,</I>[1] and not leave her, nor dismiss
                           her. Take notice, that St. Paul speaks these words to those that are already married, and speaks not of the unmarried till
                           the 8th verse. He does not then here exhort every one to marry, but admonishes married persons to live together, and not to
                           refuse the marriage duty, which neither the husband nor the wife can do without mutual consent, because of the marriage engagement.
                           Yet he advises them to abstain sometimes from what they may lawfully do, that they may <I>give themselves to prayer,</I>[2]
                           and as it is added in the common Greek copies, <I>to fasting.</I> St. Chrysostom observes, that the words of St. Paul, are
                           not only, that <I>they may pray,</I> (which no day must be omitted) but that they <I>may give themselves to prayer,</I> that
                           is, may be better disposed and prepared for prayer, contemplation, and for receiving the holy Sacrament, as we find the priests
                           even of the ancient law, were to abstain from their wives, when they were employed in the functions of their ministry. But
                           such kind of advice is not relished by all that pretend to be reformers. <I>And return together again....yet I speak this
                           by way of indulgence,</I> of what is allowed to married persons, and not commanded them, unless when one of the married couple
                           is not willing to abstain. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>as I do.</I> From hence it is evident, that St. Paul was not then married, who according to the opinion of the ancient
                           fathers, was never married. But when the apostle says, <I>I would</I> this as to <I>you all,</I> he only signifies what could
                           be wished for, the particular good of every one considered as a particular person, but what cannot be hoped for, considering
                           the state of mankind in general, and the temptations, and frailty of men. --- <I>But every one hath his proper gift from God,</I>
                           so that some prudently embrace a single life, and also make a religious vow of always living so, as it has been practised
                           by a great number both of men and women in all ages, ever since Christ's time. Others have not this more perfect gift: they
                           find themselves not disposed to lead, or vow a single life, they marry lawfully: <I>it is better to marry than to burn,</I>
                           or be burnt by violent temptations of concupiscence, by which they <I>do not contain themselves</I> from disorders of that
                           kind. It is against both the Latin and Greek text to translate, <I>they cannot contain themselves,</I> as in the Protestant
                           and Mr. N....'s translation. Dr. Wells, in his paraphrase, gives the sense of this place in these words: The inconveniences
                           of marriage are to be undergone, rather than such sinful imaginations, or practises, as arise from the flames of an ungovernable
                           lust. They therefore that are unmarried or widows, (to whom St. Paul speaks in these two verses) may have recourse to marriage
                           as a remedy. But let it be observed, that when St. Paul allows of marriage, he speaks not of those who have already made a
                           vow of living always a single life. Vows made to God must be kept. (Psalm lxxv. 12.; Ecclesiastes v. 3.) And St. Paul expressly
                           says of such persons, who have made a vow of perpetual continency, and afterwards marry, <I>that they incur damnation, because
                           they violate their first faith,</I> or vow made to God. See 1 Timothy v. 12. This saying, therefore, <I>it is better to marry
                           than to burn,</I> cannot justify the sacrilegious marriages of priests, or of any others who were under such vows. There are
                           other remedies which they are bound to make use of, and by which they may obtain the gift of continency and chastity. They
                           must ask this gift by fervent prayers to God, who gives a <I>good spirit to them that ask it.</I> (Luke xi. 15.[13.?]) They
                           must join fasting, alms, and the practice of self-denials, so often recommended in the gospel. See the annotations on Matthew
                           xix. The like remedies, and no others, must they use, who being already in wedlock, are under such violent temptations, that
                           they are continually in danger of violating, or do violate the chastity of the marriage-bed. For example, when married persons
                           are divorced from bed and board, when long absent from one another, when sick and disabled, when one has an inveterate aversion
                           to the other: they cannot marry another, but they can, and must use other remedies. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>For to the rest,</I> &amp;c. This was a case entirely new, which the wisdom of the apostle regulates according to the laws
                           of charity. Tertullian thinks that some of the faithful, who had been converted from paganism, did not esteem it lawful to
                           live any longer with their wives, who were yet buried in the superstitions of idolatry, which scruples St. Paul answers, guided
                           as he was, by the particular lights of the Holy Ghost. (Calmet) --- <I>Not the Lord.</I> That is, it is the command of the
                           Lord, for such even as are separated, not to marry to another, but when I advised the unmarried not to marry, this is a counsel,
                           or advice, not a divine precept, which doctrine he repeats again before the end of this chapter, ver. 25, 28, and 39. ---
                           <I>If any brother have a wife that believeth not,</I> &amp;c. St. Paul speaks of two that were joined by a contract of marriage,
                           when both of them were infidels, and that one of them is converted to the Christian faith: we do not read of any precept that
                           Christ gave, as to those marriages, but the apostle seems to order by his apostolical authority, that they continue as man
                           and wife, unless the party that remains still an infidel, will needs depart; then, says the apostle, <I>let</I> such an one
                           <I>depart.</I> There is also another case, to wit, when the man or woman remaining an infidel, will not live without continual
                           injuries and blasphemies against God and the Catholic religion, so that there can be no <I>peace</I> on that account betwixt
                           them. In these two cases, according to the canons of the Church, it is looked upon as no marriage, so that the party converted
                           may marry another. And this seems grounded on the reason, which the apostle here gave, <I>that God hath called us in peace.</I>
                           (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>Is sanctified.</I> The meaning is not that the faith of the husband, or the wife is of itself sufficient to put the unbelieving
                           party, or their children, in the state of grace and salvation: but that it is very often an occasion of their sanctification,
                           by bringing them to the true faith. (Challoner) --- Sanctification which has different significations, cannot here signify
                           that an infidel is truly and properly sanctified, or justified, by being married to a faithful believer; therefore we can
                           only understand an improper sanctification, so that such an infidel, though not yet converted, need not be looked upon as
                           unclean, but in the dispositions of being converted, especially living peaceably together, and consenting that <I>their children</I>
                           be baptized, by which they are truly <I>sanctified.</I> --- <I>How knowest thou, O wife?</I> &amp;c. These words seem to give
                           the reason, why they may part, when they cannot live peaceably, and when there is little prospect that the party that is an

                           But[3] <I>as the Lord hath distributed,...</I>and <I>called every one,</I> &amp;c. St. Paul proceeds to other points of discipline,
                           that persons converted may remain and continue in the same employments, and lawful state of life as before, that it is nothing
                           to the purpose, whether before his conversion he was a <I>circumcised</I> Jew, or an <I>uncircumcised</I> Gentile, circumcision
                           being no longer of obligation in the new law. If any one that is converted was a <I>bond-man,</I> or a slave, let him not
                           be concerned at this, <I>but use it rather,</I>[4] which many interpret, let him rather endeavour to be made free, though
                           St. Chrysostom and others understand, let him rather remain content with his servile condition. Perhaps it was an admonition
                           to those new converts, who might imagine that their Christian liberty exempted them from being <I>servant of men.</I> However,
                           he gives them this great comfort, that such <I>an one is the Lord's free-man,</I> that is, whoever is a Christian, and in
                           the grace of God; but he adds, let him not be a <I>slave to men,</I> that is, not follow their sinful ways, nor consent to
                           any thing that is criminal. (Witham) --- All consists in doing the will of God, by loving him with our whole heart; without
                           this, all is illusion. To attach ourselves to exterior practices contrary to the order of God, is the superstition of circumcision;
                           to despise what comes from God, is the pride of uncircumcision.</FONT></P><B>

                           It is very strange if any one, who reads this chapter without prejudices, does not clearly see, that St. Paul advises, and
                           prefers the state of virginity to that of a married life. --- <I>I think that I also have the spirit of God.</I> He puts them
                           in mind, by this modest way of speaking, of what they cannot doubt of, as to so great an apostle. (Witham) --- It is worthy
                           our notice, that St. Paul on every occasion avoids the least appearance of vanity, and frequently when delivering his own
                           opinion, gives us only a hint, hoping that we shall supply the rest. Of this apostle's modesty in this particular, we have
                           many instances in his writings, as in ver. 26. "I think, therefore, that this is good;" and likewise in chap. iv. ver. 9.
