                           place, doubtless, had its name from the great number of olive-trees that grow upon it. It lay a little out of Jerusalem, on
                           the east side, about five furlongs from the city, according to Josephus; but he must be understood of the nearest part of
                           it, since St. Luke makes the distance to be a sabbath-day's journey, i.e. eight furlongs, or a mile; unless we suppose he
                           meant the summit of the hill, from which our Saviour ascended. (Acts i. 12.) Mr. Maundrell says: I and my companions going
                           out of Jerusalem, at St. Stephen's gate and crossing the valley of Josaphat, began immediately to ascend the mountain; and
                           being about two-thirds of the way up, we came to certain grottos, cut with intricate windings and caverns, under ground, which
                           were called, <I>the sepulchres of the prophets;</I> that a little higher up, were twelve arched vaults under ground, standing
                           side by side, and built in memory of the apostles, who are said to have compiled their creed in this spot. Sixty paces higher,
                           we came to the place where Christ is said to have uttered his prophecy, concerning the final destruction of Jerusalem; and
                           a little on the right hand, to another, where he is said to have dictated (a second time) the <I>Lord's prayer</I> to his
                           disciples. A little higher, is the cave of a saint called Pelagia; a little lower, a pillar denoting the place where an angel
                           gave the blessed Virgin three day's warning of her death; and, at the top of all, we saw the place of our blessed Lord's ascension.
                           See Maundrell's Journey to Jerusalem. --- In the Greek, being between Bethphage and Bethania. Bethania, which they had just
                           left, was about one mile and a half from Jerusalem: Bethphage was between the two. (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>

                           the servants of God. Many strew their garments in the way, by subduing their bodies in fasting and abstinence, and thus affording
                           good example to those that follow them. Those cut down branches from the trees, who in their instructions take their seeds

                           to do with usurpers and intruders. ... If it be pretended that they had <I>extraordinary</I> mission, immediately derived
                           from God, why did they not shew their credentials, stamped with the broad seal of heaven; that is, why did they not by clear
                           and evident miracles, such as Christ and his apostles wrought, attest their being thus extraordinarily commissioned for the
                           extraordinary work of the Reformation? Without such proofs as these, no pretensions to an extraordinary mission, in opposition
                           to the ordinary Church authority, can be admitted. Otherwise every fanatic or enthusiast, following his own caprice, may pretend
                           to a call from heaven; and, upon this foolish plea, preach up his own dreams for the pure word of God, in contempt of all
                           authority, whether of Church or State. If it be said that the missions of the first reformers were <I>ordinary,</I> and derived
                           to them by the ministry of men, it behoves them to point out what men these were from whom they received this ordinary power.
                           Were they Catholics or Protestants? Not Protestants, for they cannot name any such who commissioned them to preach; not Catholics,
                           because the religion which Luther and his reforming brethren endeavoured to propagate, was a new religion, directly opposite
                           to that of Catholics, and therefore could not be taught, in virtue of any commission from Catholics. <I>And how can they preach
                           unless they be sent?</I> (Romans x. 15.) If it be urged that Luther had received his orders in the Catholic Church, it is
                           easily answered that this could not authorize him to commence preacher and teacher of another religion, any more than the
                           orders which Mr. Whiston and Mr. Wesley might receive in the Protestant church of England could authorize them to teach a
                           doctrine anathematized by that Church. (Rutter)</FONT></P><B>
