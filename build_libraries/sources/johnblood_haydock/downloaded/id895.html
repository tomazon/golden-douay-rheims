                           he goes intrepidly to meet Achab, he flees before a woman, God being desirous that he should exercise humility, (Theodoret,

                           and his servants. See ver. 10. (Challoner) --- He does not wish to fall into the hands of Jezabel, lest the idolaters should
                           triumph: but he is willing to die, if God so order it. (Calmet) --- Mathathias entertained the like sentiments, 1 Machabees
                           ii. 7. --- <I>Fathers: </I>that I should live longer than they did. (Menochius) (Ecclesiasticus xxx. 17.) --- If he had been

                           (Haydock) --- The idolaters threw them <I>down,</I> chap. xviii. 30. Such altars would have been unlawful in Juda. (Calmet)
                           --- <I>I alone am left;</I> viz., of the prophets in the kingdom of Israel, or of the ten tribes; for in the kingdom of Juda,
                           religion was at that time in a very flourishing condition, under the kings Asa and Josaphat. And even in Israel there remained
                           several prophets, though not then known to Elias. See chap. xx. 13, 28, 35. (Challoner) (Worthington) --- Hebrew repeats <I>I,</I>

                           Something similar happened at the giving of the law, and at the propagation of the gospel, Exodus xix. 9, 16., and Acts ii.
                           2. The Lord was pleased to shew his prophet the difference between the two laws: the one was full of terror, the other of
                           mildness. (Grotius) --- He insinuated likewise, that he could easily exterminate the offenders, but he chose to bear patiently
                           with them; (Tirinus) and taught his prophet to moderate his zeal, and, after terrifying sinners, to being them to a sense
                           of their duty by gentle means. (Sanctius) (Calmet) --- "His spirit is most indulgent and mild." ....<I>est teneræ serenitatis,

                           God does not send Elias again into the midst of danger, at Achab's court. (Haydock) --- <I>Hazael.</I> God exercises his authority
                           over all nations, and disposes of crowns. He appoints Hazael to punish his people. It does not appear that Elias performed
                           this commission in person, but by the hand of Eliseus, 4 Kings viii. 12. Neither do we find that Hazael was <I>anointed,</I>
                           but he was "declared king;" in which sense the term is used, Judges ix. 8. (Salien) (Calmet) --- Yet Torniel believes, that
                           Elias really anointed both Hazael and Jehu. He foretold, at least, (Haydock) that they should reign. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           to anoint him, (4 Kings ix. 1.; Calmet) with common oil; the sacred was reserved for priests and the kings of Juda, according

                           (Sanctius) --- Elias had complained that he was left alone. God appoints him a coadjutor, and successor; a person who seemed
                           to have yet made no immediate preparation for the office. His parents were probably known for their probity, and had taken
                           no part in the worship of idols. (Calmet) --- <I>Abelmeula</I> was in the great plain, ten miles south of Scythopolis. (Eusebius)</FONT></P><B>

                           to be king of Israel, with commission to extirpate the house of Achab. (Challoner) --- They left nothing imperfect in the

                           Abulensis (q. 23.) thinks that he might put many false prophets to death, as the Scripture does not mention every thing, (Menochius)

                           first part of the prophet's complaint, and informing him that the guilty should not pass unpunished, God lets him know that
                           he is not left alone, but that many thousands (Calmet) even in Israel still continue faithful; so far was the true Church
                           from being in danger of perishing entirely. (Haydock) --- <I>Seven</I> is often put for a great number, Proverbs xxiv. 16.
                           Yet some suppose, (Calmet) that only this number served God out of 1,110,000 men in Israel, 1 Paralipomenon xxi. 5. (Grotius,

                           or the statue itself, when they could reach it, to testify their veneration. <I>Inter adorandum, dexteram ad osculum referimus.</I>
                           (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxviii. 2.) Cicero (in Ver. 4.) mentions a beautiful statue of Hercules, the cheeks and beard of
                           which had been rather worn with kissing; <I>non solum id venerari, sed etiam osculari solent.</I> See Genesis xviii. 2. (Calmet)

                                    <p>1 And Achab told Jezabel all that Elias had done, and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.</p>
                                    <p>2 And Jezabel sent a messenger to Elias, saying: Such and such things may the gods do to me, and add still more, if by
                                    this hour to-morrow I make not thy life as the life of one of them.</p>
                                    <p>3 Then *Elias was afraid, and rising up, he went whithersoever he had a mind: and he came to Bersabee of Juda, and left
                                    his servant there,</p>
                                    <p>4 And he went forward, one day's journey into the desert. And when he was there, and sat under a juniper-tree, he requested
                                    for his soul that he might die, and said: It is enough for me, Lord; take away my soul: for I am no better than my fathers.</p>
                                    <p>5 And he cast himself down, and slept in the shadow of the juniper-tree: and behold an angel of the Lord touched him, and
                                    said to him: Arise and eat.</p>
                                    <p>6 He looked, and behold there was at his head a hearth-cake, and a vessel of water: and he ate and drank, and he fell asleep
                                    again.</p>
                                    <p>7 And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched him, and said to him: Arise, eat: for thou hast yet
                                    a great way to go.</p>
                                    <p>8 And he arose, and ate and drank, and walked in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights, unto the mount
                                    of God, Horeb.</p>
                                    <p>9 And when he was come thither, he abode in a cave: and behold the word of the Lord <i>came </i>unto him, and he said to
                                    him: What dost thou here, Elias?</p>
                                    <p>10 And he answered: With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy
                                    covenant: they have thrown down thy altars, they have slain thy prophets with the sword, and I alone am left, and they seek
                                    my life to take it away.</p>
                                    <p>11 And he said to him: Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord: and behold the Lord passeth, and a great and
                                    strong wind before the Lord, overthrowing the mountains, and breaking the rocks in pieces: but the Lord is not in the wind.
                                    And after the wind, an earthquake: <i>but</i> the Lord is not in the earthquake.</p>
                                    <p>12 And after the earthquake, a fire: but the Lord is not in the fire. And after the fire, a whistling of a gentle air.</p>
                                    <p>13 And when Elias heard it, he covered his face with his mantle, and coming forth, stood in the entering in of the cave,
                                    and behold a voice unto him, saying: What dost thou here, Elias? And he answered:</p>
                                    <p>14 With zeal have I been zealous for the Lord God of hosts: *because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant:
                                    they have destroyed thy altars, they have slain thy prophets with the sword; and I alone am left, and they seek my life to
                                    take it away.</p>
                                    <p>15 And the Lord said to him: Go, and return on thy way, through the desert, to Damascus: and when thou art come thither,
                                    thou shalt anoint Hazael to be king over Syria;</p>
                                    <p>16 *And thou shalt anoint Jehu, the son of Namsi, to be king over Israel: and Eliseus, the son of Saphat, of Abelmeula,
                                    thou shalt anoint to be prophet in thy room.</p>
                                    <p>17 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall escape the sword of Hazael, shall be slain by Jehu: and whosoever shall
                                    escape the sword of Jehu, shall be slain by Eliseus.</p>
                                    <p>18 *And I will leave me seven thousand men in Israel, whose knees have not been bowed before Baal, and every mouth that
                                    hath not worshipped him, kissing the hands.</p>
                                    <p>19 And Elias departing from thence, found Eliseus, the son of Saphat, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen: and he was one
                                    of them that were ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen: and when Elias came up to him, he cast his mantle upon him.</p>
                                    <p>20 And he forthwith left the oxen, and ran after Elias, and said: Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and
                                    then I will follow thee. And he said to him: Go, and return back: for that which was my part, I have done to thee.</p>
                                    <p>21 And returning back from him, he took a yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled the flesh with the plough of the oxen,
                                    and gave to the people, and they ate: and rising up, he went away, and followed Elias, and ministered to him.</p>
