                           two days before the Passover; and because on this day Judas sold Christ, and the Jews decreed his death, the ancient custom,
                           according to St. Augustine, originated of fasting on Wednesdays; (Ep. xxxvi. t. 3. p. 80,) and the general custom of abstaining
                           from flesh on Fridays, because on that day Jesus suffered death for our redemption. --- In the notes on these two following
                           chapters, I shall join all the chief circumstances related by the other evangelists that the reader may have a fuller and
                           more exact view of the history of Christ's sufferings and death. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           know that after two days shall be the Pasch;</I>[1] or the feast of the Pasch. The Protestants translate, <I>of the Passover.</I>
                           The French all retain the same word in their language, <I>Paque;</I> as the author of the Latin Vulgate and all other Greek
                           versions have done. It is indeed an evident mistake, (as St. Augustine observed) to take <I>Pascha</I> for a Greek word, as
                           Mr. N... has done, who in his note on this place says, <I>Pascha,</I> in Greek, is a passion or suffering. It is certain that
                           the word <I>Pascha,</I> or <I>Pasche,</I> is from a Hebrew derivation, signifying a <I>passing by</I> or <I>passing over.</I>
                           Yet it must also be observed, that this same word <I>Pascha,</I> has different significations; sometimes it is put for the
                           <I>Paschal Lamb,</I> that was sacrificed; as Luke xxii. 7, elsewhere for the <I>first day</I> of the <I>Paschal feast</I>
                           and solemnity, which lasted seven days; as in this place, and Ezechiel xlv. 21. Again it is taken for the sabbath-day, that
                           happened within the seven days of the solemnity. (John xix. 14.) And it is also used to signify all the sacrifices, that were
                           made during the seven days' feast; as John xviii. 28. (Witham) --- <I>And the Son of man.</I> Jesus Christ informed his disciples
                           of the bloody transactions, which were soon to be perpetrated at Jerusalem, lest they might be disheartened, when they saw
                           their Master condemned to die on a cross. Christ was delivered up to death by his heavenly Father out of love for man; he
                           is betrayed by Judas for base lucre, condemned by the priests out of envy, and persecuted by the common enemy of mankind,
                           who feared that his empire and reign might be destroyed among men by the preaching of our Redeemer; not perceiving, that man
                           would be freed from his empire more by his death, than by his preaching. (Origen)</FONT></P><B>

                           Judas informed them how he could and would put him into their hands on Thursday night. St. Jerome takes notice, that when
                           they said, <I>Not on the festival,</I> it was not through a motive of religion that they made this objection, but only lest
                           a tumult should happen in his favour among the people; (Witham) for they looked upon him as a great prophet. --- Behold how
                           fearful these people are, not of offending God, nor of increasing the enormity of their most atrocious crime, by committing
                           it on the solemnity of the Passover, but of offending men by raising a tumult. Still boiling over with rage, they no sooner
                           found the Traitor, than yielding to the impulse of their blind fury, they gladly seized the opportunity offered, and immolating
                           their victim in the middle of their solemnity. Though this their wickedness was the instrument of the divine dispensation,
                           to bring about the greatest good, still they will not go without receiving condign punishment; which the perversity of their
                           wills so richly deserved, for murdering innocence itself; and at a time when guilt was accustomed to meet with mercy and forgiveness.
                           (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxxx.) --- We know that by a decree of divine Providence, what had been so long and so earnestly sought
                           for by the Jewish princes, viz. an opportunity of murdering the innocent Lamb of God, was not granted to them, except on the
                           very feast of the Pasch. For it was only fitting, that what had been for such a length of time figuratively promised, should
                           be manifestly fulfilled; that the true Lamb should supersede the figurative one; and that by one grand sacrifice, the vast
                           variety of offerings and holocausts should be done away. (St. Leo the great)</FONT></FONT></P><B>

                           Jesus was in Bethania,</I> &amp;c. St. Augustine observes, that this pouring of the ointment on Jesus is not related by St.
                           Matthew in due order of time. It was not done on this Wednesday, but as St. John expressly tells us, (xii. 1.) <I>six days
                           before the Pasch,</I> or <I>Paschal feast,</I> began. This anointing was different from that done in the house of the Pharisee,
                           and in Galilee, set down by St. Luke, Chap. vii. 37. (Witham) --- St. Matthew mentions the fact in this place, because it
                           was in some measure the occasion of Judas's treason. (Bible de Vence) --- St. Ambrose seems to assert, that the Simon here
                           mentioned was at that time a leper, in the following words: "Hence, it appears, that Christ did not flee the company of lepers;
                           he kept company with the unclean, that he might purify them from their uncleanness." St. Jerome is of opinion that Simon was
                           not then a leper, but had been cured of a leprosy by our Lord; and that he afterwards retained the name of leper, as St. Matthew,
                           after he was called by our Saviour, continued to be called the Publican. The latter sentiment seem most probable, because
                           the Jews were not permitted to associate with lepers. (Denis the Carthusian)</FONT></P><B>

                           of things, which is blameworthy. That man is not to be blamed, who does not exceed the rules followed by good, honourable,
                           and conscientious men, with whom he associates. What, therefore, in some is often reprehensible, in another is highly commendable.
                           A good reputation is a sweet perfume, which a man merits for his worthy deeds; and whilst he follows the footsteps of Christ,
                           he may justly be said to anoint our Redeemer's feet with a most precious ointment. (St. Augustine)</FONT></P><B>

                           It was chiefly Judas, who blamed aloud this profusion. (Bible de Vence) --- St. Matthew and St. Mark mention the disciples.
                           But such of them as spoke, were persuaded to what they said either by Judas's words, or by their feeling and affection for
                           the poor; but the only motive of Judas was avarice. (St. Thomas Aquinas)</FONT></P><B>

                           do you trouble this woman?</I> By this, our Saviour teaches us, that we are not to expect the more perfect acts of virtue

                           the tender bud of her faith might not be blasted, but that her virtues might be watered with tenderness, and thus assisted
                           to produce greater fruit for the future. When, therefore, we behold any good action done, though some imperfection may creep
                           in with it, still ought we to behold it with kindness, and assist it to bring forth more perfect acts for the time to come.

                           St. Mark (xiv. 8.) says, <I>She hath prevented the time to anoint me,</I> which is done at burials, for my time of being buried

                           manner, as if we had conferred the same charity on himself. This saying does not contradict what he afterwards said: <I>behold,
                           I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world;</I> (Chap. xxviii. 20.) because in the former, he only speaks

                           for a trifling gain. There is no vestige of honour or justice, or probity, remaining in the heart of that man who is possessed

                           consideration of thirty pieces of silver, about £3 15. the price of a common slave. See Exodus xxi. 32. It is probable that

                           first day of the azymes;</I> unleavened bread. St. Mark (xiv. 12.) adds, <I>when they sacrificed the Pasch:</I> and St. Luke
                           (xxii. 7.) says, <I>And the day of the unleavened bread came; on which it was necessary that the Pasch</I> (i.e. the Paschal
                           lamb) <I>should be killed.</I> From hence it follows, that Christ sent his apostles that very day (the 14th day of the month
                           of Nisan) on which, in the evening, or at night, <I>the Pasch</I> was to be eaten; and which was to be with unleavened bread.
                           It is true, the 15th <I>day</I> of that month is called (Exodus xii. 1.[2.?]) <I>the first day of unleavened bread:</I> but
                           we must take notice, that the Jews began their feasts, or festivals, from sunset of the evening before; and consequently on
                           the evening of the 14th day of the moon: at which time there was to be no leavened bread in any of their houses. This shews
                           that Christ eat the <I>Pasch,</I> or <I>Paschal lamb,</I> after sunset. And when the Paschal supper was over, he consecrated
                           the blessed Eucharist, in unleavened bread, as the Latin Church doth. There are two or three difficulties relating to this
                           matter in St. John, of which in their proper places. (Witham) --- There were four passovers during Christ's public ministry.
                           The 1st was after the marriage feast of Cana, in the 31st year of Jesus, and the 779th from the foundation of Rome. to derive
                           <I>pascha</I> from the Greek, <I><U>paschein</U>,</I> <I>to suffer,</I> is a mistake, as St. Augustine observes; tract. lv.
                           in Joah. It is certainly taken from the Hebrew, and signifies <I>a passing by,</I> or <I>passing over:</I> 1st, because the
                           children of Israel passed in haste on that night out of the land of Egypt; 2d, because the angel, who on that night killed
                           all the first-born of the Egyptians, seeing the doors of the Israelites stained with the blood of the paschal lamb, passed
                           by all theirs untouched; 3d, because that was a figure of our Saviour passing out of this life to his eternal Father. Yet
                           it must be observed that this same word, <I>pascha,</I> or passover, is used sometimes for the <I>paschal lamb,</I> that was
                           sacrificed; (Luke xxii. 7.) elsewhere, for the first day of the paschal feast and solemnity, which lasted seven days; (Matthew
                           xxvi. 2; Ezechiel xlv. 21.) for the sabbath-day, which occurred within the seven days of the solemnity; (John xix. 14.) and
                           also for all the sacrifices made during the seven days' feast. The Passover was the most solemn rite of the old law. When
                           God ordered the Israelites to sprinkle the blood of the lamb upon their door-posts, it was solely with a view of signifying,
                           that the blood of the true Lamb was to be the distinctive mark of as many as should be saved. Every thing was mysteriously
                           and prophetical. A bone of the lamb was not to be broken; and they broke not the arms or legs of Jesus Christ, on the cross.
                           The lamb was to be free from blemish; to express the perfect sanctity of Jesus Christ, the immaculate Lamb of God. The paschal
                           lamb was to be sacrificed and eaten; because Christ was to suffer and die for us: and unless we eat his flesh, we shall have
                           no life in us. The door-posts of the Israelites were to be sprinkled with blood, that the destroying angel might pass over
                           them; for with the blood of Christ our souls are to be purified, that sin and death may not prevail against us. In every house
                           was eaten a whole lamb; and Christ, at communion, is received whole and entire by every faithful soul. --- The manner in which
                           it was to be eaten, shews the proper dispositions for Christians when they receive the blessed sacrament. The roasting by
                           fire, expresses divine charity; the unleavened bread, sincerity, truth, and a good conscience; the bitter herbs, repentance
                           and contrition for sin; the girded loins and shod feet, the restraint upon our passions and lusts, and a readiness to follow
                           the rules of the gospel; the staff, our mortal pilgrimage, and that having no lasting dwelling here, we should make the best
                           of our way to our true country, the heavenly Chanaan. --- On this day the passover was to be eaten, at least by a part of
                           the people, according to St. Matthew, St. Mark, and St. Luke; i.e. according to some, by the Galileans; for, according to
                           St. John, it appears that the priests, and the Jews properly so called, such as dwelt in Judea, did not immolate it till the
                           next day. (John xiii. 1, xviii. 28, and xix. 14.) (Bible de Vence) --- But we have here again to remark, that the Jews began
                           their day from sunset of the previous day.</FONT></P><B>

                           they being very much troubled.</I> There were three motives for this great sorrow in the disciples: 1st, because they saw
                           their innocent and dear Master was so soon to be taken from them, and delivered up to a most cruel and ignominious death;
                           2d, because each of them was afraid lest, through human frailty, he might fall into so great a crime; for they all were convinced,

                           question with the rest. (Origen) --- It is remarkable that Judas did not ask, <I>is it I, Lord?</I> but, <I>is it I, Rabbi?</I>
                           to which our Saviour replied, <EM>thou hast said it</EM>: which answer might have been spoken in so low a tone of voice, as

                           may succeed to the figure in one and the same banquet; and to impress more deeply upon our minds the remembrance of so singular
                           a favour, his last and best gift to man. He would not institute it at the beginning of his ministry; he first prepares his
                           disciples for the belief of it, by changing water into wine, and by the miraculous multiplication of the loaves. --- <I>Whilst
                           they were,</I> &amp;c. before they parted: for by St. Luke (xxii. 20.) and 1 Corinthians (xi. 25.) the blessed sacrament was

                           thanks. This blessing</I> and <I>giving thanks,</I> was not the consecration itself, but went before it. See the Council of
                           Trent, session xiii. chap. i. (Witham) --- <I>This is my body.</I> He does not say, <I>this is the figure of my body</I>---but,
                           <I>this is my body.</I> (2d Council of Nice. Act. vi.) Neither does he say <I>in this,</I> or <I>with this is my body,</I>
                           but absolutely <I>this is my body;</I> which plainly implies transubstantiation. (Challoner) --- Catholics maintain, after
                           the express words of Scripture, and the universal tradition of the Church, that Christ in the blessed sacrament is <I>corporally</I>
                           and <I>substantially</I> present; but not <I>carnally;</I> not in that gross, natural, and sensible manner, in which our separated
                           brethren misrepresent the Catholic doctrine, as the Capharnaites did of old; (John vi. 61, 62.) who were scandalized with
                           it. ... If Protestants, in opposition to the primitive Fathers, deny the connection of the sixth chapter of John with the
                           institution, <I>it is from the fear of giving advantage to the doctrine of transubstantiation,</I> says Dr. Clever, Protestant
                           bishop of Bangor. --- <I>This is my body.</I> By these words, and his divine power, Christ changed that which before was bread
                           into his own body; not in that visible and bloody manner as the Capharnaites imagined. (John vi.) Yet so, that the elements
                           of bread and wine were truly, really, and substantially changed into the substance of Christ's body and blood. Christ, whose
                           divine power cannot be questioned, could not make use of plainer words than these set down by St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke,
                           and St. Paul to the Corinthians: <I>this is my body; this is my blood:</I> and that the bread and wine, at the words of consecration
                           are changed into the body and blood of Christ, has been the constant doctrine and belief of the Catholic Church, in all ages,
                           both in the east and west, both in the Greek and Latin churches; as may be seen in our controvertists, and particularly in
                           the author of the books of the <I>Perpetuity of the Faith.</I> The first and fundamental truths of the Christian faith, by
                           which we profess to believe the mystery of the holy Trinity, i.e. <I>one God </I>and <I>three divine Persons,</I> and of the
                           <I>incarnation,</I> i.e. that the true Son of God was made man, was born, suffered and died upon the cross for our salvation,
                           are no less obscure and mysterious, no less above the reach of human capacity, than this of the real presence: nor are they
                           more clearly expressed in the sacred text. This change the Church hath thought proper to express by the word, <I>transubstantiation:</I>
                           and it is as frivolous to reject this word, and to ask where it is found in the holy Scriptures, as to demand where we read
                           in the Scriptures, the words, <I>trinity, incarnation, consubstantial to the Father,</I> &amp;c. --- Luther fairly owned that
                           he wanted not an inclination to deny Christ's real presence in the sacrament, by which he should vex and contradict the Pope;
                           but this, said he, is a truth that cannot be denied:[3] <I>The words of the gospel are too clear.</I> He and his followers
                           hold, what is called <I>impanation,</I> or <I>consubstantiation;</I> i.e. that there is really present, both the substance
                           of the bread and wine, and also the substance of Christ's body and blood. --- Zuinglius, the Sacramentarians, and Calvinists
                           deny the real presence; and hold that the word <I>is,</I> (<I>est</I>) importeth no more, than it <I>signifieth,</I> or is
                           a <I>figure</I> of Christ's body; as it hath been lately translated, <I>this represents my body,</I> in a late translation,
                           or rather paraphrase, 1729. I shall only produce here the words and reasoning of Luther: which may deserve the attention of
                           the later reformers. [4]"Who," saith Luther, (tom. vii. Edit. Wittemb. p. 391) "but the devil, hath granted such a license
                           of wresting the words of the holy Scripture? Who ever read in the Scriptures, that <I>my body</I> is the same as <I>the sign

                           then the <I>devil,</I> that imposeth upon us by these fanatical men. ... Not <I>one</I> of the Fathers, though so numerous,
                           ever spoke as the Sacramentarians: not one of them ever said,<I> It is only bread and wine;</I> or, <I>the body and blood
                           of Christ is not there present.</I> Surely it is not <I>credible,</I> nor <I>possible,</I> since they often speak, and repeat
                           their sentiments, that they should never (if they thought so) not so much <I>as once,</I> say, or let slip these words: <I>It
                           is bread only;</I> or <I>the body of Christ is not there,</I> especially it being of great importance, that men should not
                           be deceived. Certainly in so many Fathers, and in so many writings, the <I>negative</I> might at least be found <I>in one
                           of them,</I> had they <I>thought the body and blood of Christ were</I> not really present: but they are all of them unanimous."
                           Thus far Luther; who, in another place, in his usual manner of writing, hesitates not to call the Sacramentarians, men <I>possessed,
                           prepossessed,</I> and <I>transpossessed by the devil.</I>[5] --- <I>My body.</I> In St. Luke is added, <I>which is given for

                           yet as it was the true <FONT size=3>body of Christ, that was to be crucified,so it was the same true body </FONT>which Christ
                           gave to his apostles, at his last supper, though in a different manner. --- The holy Eucharist is not only <I>a sacrament,</I>
                           but also a <I>sacrifice,</I> succeeding to all the sacrifices of the ancient law, which Christ commanded all the priests of
                           the new law to offer up. Luther was forced to own, that divers Fathers, taught this doctrine; as Irenæus, Cyprian, Augustine:
                           and in his answer to Henry VIII. of England: The king, says he, brings the testimonies of the Fathers, to prove the sacrifice
                           of the mass, for my part, I care not, if <I>a thousand Augustines, a thousand Cyprians, a thousand Churches,</I> like that
                           <I>of Henry,</I> stand against me. The Centurists of Magdeburg own the same to have been the doctrine of Cyprian, Tertullian,
                           and also of Irenæus, in the end of the second age; and that St. Gregory of Nazianzen, in the fourth age, calls it an <I>unbloody

                           the bread and wine as bare and common elements, for they are the body and blood of Christ; as our Lord assures us. Although
                           thy senses suggest this to thee, let faith make thee firm and sure. Judge not of the thing by the taste, but be certain from
                           faith that thou has been honoured with the gift of Christ's body and blood. When he has pronounced and said of the bread,
                           <I>this is my body,</I> who will after this dare to doubt? And when he has assured, and said, <I>this is my blood,</I> who
                           can ever hesitate, saying it in not his blood? He changed water into wine at Cana; and shall we not him worthy of our belief,
                           when he changed wine into blood? Wherefore, let us receive them with an entire belief, as Christ's body and blood; for under
                           the figure of bread, is given to thee his body, and under the figure of wine, his blood; that when thou hast received Christ's
                           body and blood, thou be made one body and blood with him; for so we carry him about in us, his body and blood being distributed

                           Milan, who died in 396, proving that the change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, is really possible
                           to God, and really takes place in the blessed Eucharist, uses these words: "Will not the words of Christ have power enough
                           to change the species of the elements? Shall not the words of Christ, which could make out of nothing things which did not
                           exist, be able to change that, which already exists, into what it was not? It is not a less exertion of power to give a new
                           nature to things, than to change their natures. Let us propose examples from himself and assert the truth of this mystery
                           from the incarnation. Was it according to the course of nature, that our Lord Jesus Christ should be born of the Virgin Mary?
                           It is evident that it was contrary to the course of nature for a virgin to bring forth. Now this body, which we produce, was
                           born of the virgin. Who dost thou seek for the order of nature in the body of Christ, when our Lord Jesus Christ was born
                           of a virgin. (St. Ambrose, lib. de initiandis, chap. ix.)</FONT></P><B>

                           speak less clearly on this subject. "He," (i.e. Jesus Christ,) says the holy doctor, hom. l. in Matt. "has given us himself
                           to eat, and has set himself in the place of a victim sacrificed for us." And in hom. lxxxiii.: "How many now say they could
                           wish to see his form, his garments, &amp;c.; you wish to see his garments, but he gives you himself not only to be seen, but
                           to be touched, to be eaten, to be received within you. Than what beam of the sun ought not that hand to be purer, which divides
                           this flesh! That mouth, which is filled with this spiritual fire! That tongue, which is purpled with this adorable blood!
                           The angels beholding it tremble, and dare not look thereon through awe and fear, on account of the rays, which dart from that,
                           wherewith we are nourished, with which we are mingled, being made one body, one flesh with Christ. What shepherd ever fed
                           his sheep with his own limbs? Nay, many mothers turn over their children to mercenary nurses; whereas he feeds us with his
                           own blood!" --- On another occasion, to inspire us with a dread of profaning the sacred body of Christ, he says: "When you
                           see Him exposed before you, say to yourself: this body was pierced with nails; this body which was scourged, death did not
                           destroy; this body was nailed to a cross, at which spectacle the sun withdrew his rays; this body the Magi venerated." ---
                           "There is as much difference between the loaves of proposition and the body of Christ, as between a shadow and a body, between
                           a picture and the reality." Thus St. Jerome upon the epistle to Titus, chap. i. See more authorities in the notes on St. Mark's

                           sacrament; because Christ upon this same occasion, and as I may say, with the same breath, bid the apostles do so, in these
                           words, (St. Luke xxii. 19,) <I>Do this for a commemoration of me.</I> (Challoner) --- It is a point of discipline, which the
                           Church for good reasons may allow, or disallow to the laity, without any injury done to the receiver, who according to the

                           bread shall live for ever.</I> (John vi.) ... When our adversaries object to us, in opposition to the very clear and precise
                           proofs we produce from the primitive writers of the doctrine of the <I>real presence,</I> that is called sometimes bread,
                           a figure, a sign; we reply, that they can only mean that the outward forms of bread and wine, which remain after consecration,
                           are a figure, a sign, a commemoration. They nowhere teach that the consecrated species are barely figures or signs, and nothing
                           more. On the contrary, with St. Cyril above quoted, they say: "Let your soul rejoice in the Lord, being persuaded of it, as
                           a thing most certain, that the bread, which appears to our eyes, in not bread, though our taste do judge it to be so, but
                           the body of Christ: and that the wine which appears to our eyes, is not wine, but the blood of Christ" (Myst. catech. 4, p.
                           528); and with St. Gregory of Nyssa, born in 331, "the bread, which at the beginning was common bread, after it has been consecrated
                           by the mysterious word, is called, and is become, the body of Christ." And with St. Paulinus, in the same age, "the flesh
                           of Christ, with which I am nourished, is the same flesh as that fastened to the cross; and the blood, with which my heart
                           is purified, is the same blood that was spilt upon the cross."</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>This is my blood of the New Testament, which shall be shed for many for the remission of sins.</I> The Greek text in St.
                           Luke shews that the words <I>shall be shed,</I> or <I>is shed,</I> cannot, in construction, be referred to the <I>blood of</I>
                           Christ shed on the cross, but to the <I>cup,</I> at the institution of the holy sacrament. <I>This </I>cup (says Luke xxii.
                           20,) <I>is the New Testament in my blood; which </I>cup[6] <I>shall be shed, or is shed for you.</I> St. Paul also saith:
                           <I>this cup is the New Testament in my blood.</I> And if any one will needs insist upon the words, as related by St. Matthew
                           and St. Mark, the sense is still the same; viz. that this cup was not wine, but the blood of Christ, by which the New Testament
                           was confirmed, or alliance betwixt God and man. --- <I>For many.</I> St. Luke and St. Paul, instead <I>of many,</I> say <I>for

                           in these words: <I>This is the blood of the Testament,</I> (Hebrews ix. 20,) so here is the institution of the New Testament,
                           in Christ's blood, by these words: <EM>This is the blood of the New Testament,</EM> which God contracts with you, to communicate
                           to you his grace and justice, by the merits of this blood, which shall be shed for you on the cross; and which is here mystically
                           shed for many, for the remission of sins: for the Greek is in the present tense in all the three evangelists, and in St. Paul,

                           will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine.</I> In St. Luke, (xxii. 15, 16,) Christ said to his disciples; <I>I
                           earnestly desired to eat this Pasch with you before I suffer;</I> (or this <I>paschal sacrifice</I>) <I>for I say to you,

                           no more, than that it was the last time he would eat and drink with them in a mortal body. And if, as some expound it, Christ,
                           by the <I>generation of the vine,</I> understood the consecrated cup of his blood, he might call it <I>wine,</I> or the <I>fruit
                           of the vine;</I> because he gave them his blood under the appearance of wine; as St. Paul calls the body of Christ <I>bread,</I>
                           because given under the appearance of bread. (1 Corinthians xi. 26.) (Witham) --- <I>Fruit of the vine.</I> These words, by
                           the account of St. Luke, (xxii. 18,) were not spoken of the sacramental cup, but of the wine that was drunk with the paschal
                           lamb. Though the Sacramental cup might also be called the <I>fruit of the vine,</I> because it was consecrated from wine,
                           and retains the likeness, and all the accidents, or qualities, of wine. (Challoner) --- As St. Paul calleth the body of Christ
                           <I>bread,</I> so the blood of Christ may still be called <I>wine,</I> for three reasons: 1. Because it was so before; as in
                           Genesis xi.[ii.?] 23, Eve is called Adam's bone; in Exodus vii, Aaron's <I>rod devoured their rods,</I> whereas they were
                           not now rods but serpents; and in John ii, He <I>tasted the water made wine, </I>whereas it was now wine not water. 2. Because
                           the blessed Eucharist retaineth the forms of bread and wine, and things in Scripture are frequently called from their appearance;
                           as Tobias v, the archangel Raphael, is called a young man; and Genesis xviii, three men appeared to Abraham; whereas they
                           were three angels. 3. Because Jesus Christ in the blessed Sacrament is the true bread of life, refreshing us in soul and body
                           to everlasting life. (Bristow) --- <I>Drink it new,</I> after a different manner most wonderful and hitherto unheard of, not

                           will never be.</I> After our Saviour had assured them of the prediction of the prophet, that the flock should be dispersed,
                           and had confirmed it himself, still Peter denied it; and the more Christ assured him of his weakness, the more, according
                           to St. Luke, (chap. xxii.) did Peter affirm that he would not deny him. Whence this confidence in Peter? who when our Lord
                           had said, that one of them would betray him, feared for himself, and though conscious of nothing, still prevailed on St. John
                           to put the question to our Saviour. Freed now from that solicitude and anxiety, which had so much oppressed him concerning
                           the treason of Judas, he began to trust to himself. Let us learn from this fall of the chief of the apostles, ever to assent

                           our senses and understanding contradictory; for, the word of God can never be made void; but our senses may easily be deceived.

                           This is the true meaning of that law, so very ill understood by many. See also Menochius, who on these very words of Leviticus
                           says: if any one shall be called upon to say what he knows of a point that another has confirmed by oath, he shall carry his
                           iniquity, i.e. the punishment of his iniquity, which God will inflict. (Menochius) --- See 1 Kings xiv. 24. 27; Numbers v.
                           19; 1 Thessalonians v. 27. The confession or denial of a person thus interrogated was decisive. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>
