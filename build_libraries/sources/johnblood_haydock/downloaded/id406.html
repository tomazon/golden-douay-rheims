                           seem to signify the light of doctrine, and the integrity of life, with which the priests of God ought to approach to him.
                           (Challoner) --- <I>Aurim</I> means things <I>brilliant,</I> "declarations," Septuagint, and <I>thomim,</I> "perfections,"
                           or "truths." Some imagine, that God required the stones of the rational to be of the utmost brilliancy and perfection; Oleaster
                           and Josephus (Antiquities iii. 8,) say, it was by the appearance of those stones that the high priest was enlightened, when
                           he consulted God. If God approved of what was in agitation, they assumed a surprising brightness, as well as those on the
                           high priest's shoulders. But this had not happened for 200 years before he began his history. The Urim and Thummim were not
                           in the second temple, 1 Esdras ii. 63. Some think these words were engraven on stones in the rational. Whether God explained
                           his will by articulate sounds, as (Matthew iii. 17,) <I>this is my beloved son,</I> or internally instructed the high priest,
                           when he was consulted, cannot be determined. (Calmet) --- St. Chrysostom is of the former opinion. "If any thing was to be
                           known, a voice came from between the cherubim, from the propitiatory, to declare what would happen." As the Jews lost the
                           propitiatory, when they were led captives to Babylon, it seems they never afterwards obtained this privilege of having an
                           oracle. God sometimes instructed them by his prophets. But, for a long time, none had appeared; that all might attend more
                           earnestly to the voice of the Messias. (Tirinus) --- <I>Judgment.</I> He shall be the supreme judge in religious matters,
                           and must strive to pass sentence according to the dictates of my law, with truth. (Haydock) --- The chief judge in Egypt wore
                           a golden chain, hanging from the neck on the breast, to which was attached the image of Truth, on a sapphire stone. Olian
                           (Var. Hist. xxxiv. 14,) also observes, that this office was always held by a venerable and honest priest.</FONT></P><B>

                           This means, perhaps, that he shall wear these grand vestments and crown only on the solemn day of expiation, when he makes
                           atonement for all the sins of the people, as a figure of Jesus Christ. Josephus tells us, that on other occasions, he wore
                           a less costly attire. (Jewish Wars v. 6. or 15.) (Calmet) --- By bearing on his forehead <I>kodesh la Yehovah,</I> "Holiness
                           to the Lord," he confessed that all mankind were sinners, and stood in need of pardon. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           In Ezechiel (xliv. 17,) woollen garments are forbidden to be worn by priests. Many of the pagans required their priests to
                           be clothed in white linen. All these prescriptions of God, which seem to us so minute, had a more sublime and mysterious meaning.
                           <I>For in the priestly robe....was the whole world,</I> by the colours denoting the air, light, earth, and water: the two
                           stones on his shoulders, signified the sun and moon, as the 12 did the signs of the zodiac, or <I>the glory of the fathers;
                           and thy majesty was written upon the diadem of his head,</I> Wisdom xviii. 24. Thus the priest was a mediator between God
                           and his people, and was to be solicitous for the welfare of all. (St. Thomas Aquinas, 1, 2, q. 102, a. 5; St. Augustine; St.

                           breeches,</I> descending as far as the knees. (St. Jerome) In chap. xxxix. 29, they seem to have been made of byssus, or cotton.
                           But as linen is prescribed in all other places, perhaps a word has crept in there, by mistake of the transcribers. They were
                           intended to remind the priests of superior modesty, as they were not commonly worn. Homer never mentions them. Virgil only
                           specifies the cloak and tunic of Evander. Augustus wore breeches and stockings in winter. (Suetonius) --- But the ancient
                           breeches were not like ours, but resembled rather an apron or girdle, enveloping both thighs, and hanging from the waist.
