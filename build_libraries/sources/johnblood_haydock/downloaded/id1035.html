                           the title of the Median, the latter of the Persian, monarchs. This king reigned over both nations, and was most probably Darius
                           Hystaspes, the third king of the Persians, (Tirinus) who subdued India, &amp;c. (Herodotus) (Calmet) (Tirinus) --- Some understand
                           Cambyses, (1 Esdras iv.; Genebrard) or Xerxes (Scalig.) or Artaxerxes Longimanus, (Bellarmine; Salien) or Memnon, (Eusebius)
                           or Ochus. (Serarius) --- But (Calmet) the author of 3 Esdras iii. 1., and iv. 43., seems clearly declared for Hystaspes. (Tirinus)
                           --- Though that work be not canonical, (Du Hamel) it may claim some authority, as an ancient history. (Haydock) --- This king
                           gave orders for the building of the temple, 1 Esdras vi. 1, 14. --- <i>India.</i> Part had been (Calmet) subject to Xerxes.
                           (Herodotus vii. 65.) --- But Darius subdued the country, and imposed a heavy tribute. (Herodotus iv. 44.) --- <i>Ethiopia,</i>
                           beyond Egypt, paid an acknowledgment. Cambyses had taken possession of this country. (Calmet) --- Some understand a part of
                           Arabia to be meant. (Du Hamel) --- <i>Seven:</i> 120 had been regulated by Darius, the Mede, Daniel vi. 1. (Haydock) --- The
                           number might vary as the monarch chose. (Du Hamel) --- Herodotus (iii. 89.) only specifies "twenty." But he speaks of large
                           departments, to which he intimates that several others were subordinate. (Calmet) --- <i>Provinces.</i> Hebrew <i>medina,</i>
                           "seat of judges." (Haydock) --- Prefecture. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           (Calmet) (Ælian, Anim. xiii. 18.) (Tirinus) --- He seems to have resided here almost constantly. The preceding kings (Calmet)
                           spent the winter in this warm climate, and perhaps the spring. See 2 Esdras i. 1. They spent other parts of the year at Ecbatana

                           (Athen. iv. 13.) --- The Roman emperors sometimes treated all the citizens of Rome, and Alexander did the like to 9000 of
                           his chief officers for one day. But the magnificence of Assuerus surpasses all the rest. The Persians were famous on this

                           left arm, and having his feet behind the next. (Tirinus) --- These beds were made very low, in Persia; so that Alexander had
                           one put under his feet, when he sat on the throne of Darius, as he was not so tall. (Curtius v. 7.) --- Their magnificence

                           a king of the feast, whose orders all were obliged to obey in drinking. (Horace i. Ode 4.) (Ecclesiasticus xxxii. 1.) ---
                           This was an occasion of quarrels, (St. Jerome) and of intoxication. Agesilaus followed the example of Assuerus. Darius, and
