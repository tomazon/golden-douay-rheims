                           His title to the crown was incontestable, so that he might justly make war, particularly in his own defence, and receive those
                           who flocked to him to screen themselves from the persecution of Saul, and from their debtors, whom they would thus enable
                           themselves to repay in time, by the plunder which they would take from the enemy. David maintained the strictest discipline,
                           and withheld his men from making any disturbance, always manifesting the greatest respect for the person of the king. (Calmet)

                                    me, especially when even my son hath entered into league with the son of Isai? There is not one of you that pitieth my case,
                                    nor that giveth me any information: because my son hath raised up my servant against me, plotting against me to this day.</font></p>

                                    of Saul, answering, said: I saw the son of Isai, in Nobe, with Achimelech, the son of Achitob, the priest.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And he consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 Then the king sent to call for Achimelech, the priest, the son of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And Saul said to Achimelech: Hear, thou son of Achitob. He answered:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And Saul said to him: Why have you conspired against me, thou, and

                                    me, continuing a traitor to this day.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And Achimelech answering the king, said: And who amongst all thy servants

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Did I begin to-day to consult the Lord for him? far be this from me:
                                    let not the king suspect such a thing against his servant, <i>or any one </i>in all my father's house: for thy servant knew
                                    nothing of this matter, either little or great.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And the king said: Dying thou shalt die, Achimelech, thou and all

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And the king said to the messengers that stood about him: Turn, and

                                    And the king's servants would not put forth their hands against the priests of the Lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And the king said to Doeg: Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And
                                    Doeg, the Edomite, turned, and fell upon the priests, and slew in that day eighty-five men that wore the linen ephod.</font></p>
