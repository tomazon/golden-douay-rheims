                           <i>Joarib.</i> This family was the most distinguished, as Josephus, who sprung from it, asserts, (Haydock) being the first
                           of the twenty-four families of priests, 1 Paralipomenon xxiv. 7, 19. (Menochius) --- Mathathias was probably a descendant
                           of <i>Phinees,</i> (ver. 54.) and was officiating when the impious orders arrived. Whereupon he retired to Modin, (Calmet)
                           near Diospolis. (St. Jerome) --- Many say he was chosen high priest; and therefore decided the question about fighting on
                           the sabbath. But any other, in similar emergencies, might have given that decision. (Calmet) --- Judas was chosen, (Josephus)
                           and Jonathas exercised the functions. (Antiquities xx. 8.) --- To verify the prediction of Jacob, some have concluded that
                           the Machabees were allied to the tribe of Juda by the mother's side. (St. Jerome; St. Augustine, contra Faust. i. 72.) ---
                           Yet this is not proved, nor requisite. They were called Asmoneans, either from the town of Asamon, (Josue xv. 27.) or from
                           Assamoneus, great grandfather of Mathathias. (Josephus, Antiquities xii. 8.) --- This family ruled till Herod, 128 years.
                           (Calmet) --- Here an account is given of their wars, and more fully in the eight last chapters of the second Book[2 Machabees].
                           (Worthington) --- Perhaps John, Mathathias, &amp;c., were chosen high priests by the people, while the king sent others. (Selden)</font></p><b>

                           particularly as the word is written <i>Machabee.</i> (Calmet) --- Yet this is liable to the objection of <i>c</i> being placed

                           Luke xiv. 5. The law has thus been variously explained. The Machabees judged with prudence. Yet superstition had again gained
                           ground, when Josephus (vita) would not fight or assemble his forces on the sabbath, as being contrary to the law. In a storm,
                           a Jewish pilot abandoned the helm till the danger was evident. (Synes. ep. iv.)</font></p><b>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 Then Mathathias answered, and said with a loud voice: Although all

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 I and my sons, and my brethren will obey the law of our fathers.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 God be merciful unto us: it is not profitable for us to forsake the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 We will not hearken to the words of king Antiochus, neither will we

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Now as he left off speaking these words, there came a certain Jew

                                    wrath was kindled according to the judgment of the law, and running upon him he slew him upon the altar:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 Moreover the man whom king Antiochus had sent, who compelled them

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And shewed zeal for the law, *as Phinees did by Zamri, the son of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And Mathathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying: Every

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 So he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that they

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 Then many that sought after judgment, and justice, went down into

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 And it was told to the king's men, and to the army that was in Jerusalem,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 And forthwith they went out towards them, and made war against them

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And they said to them: Do you still resist? come forth, and do according

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And they said: We will not come forth, neither will we obey the king's

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And they made haste to give them battle. </font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 But they answered them not, neither did they cast a stone at them,
                                    nor stopped up the secret places,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 Saying: Let us all die in our innocency: and heaven and earth shall

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 So they gave them battle on the sabbath: and they were slain with

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 And every man said to his neighbour: If we shall all do as our brethren

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 And they determined in that day, saying: Whosoever shall come up against

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 Then was assembled to them the congregation of the Assideans, the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 And they gathered an army, and slew the sinners in their wrath, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">47 And they pursued after the children of pride, and the work prospered
