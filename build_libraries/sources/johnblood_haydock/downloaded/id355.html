                           land given to idolatry. He begins to suspect that the place had been formerly consecrated to the worship of the true God,
                           (Calmet) as it probably had by Abraham, who dwelt near Bethel, (Chap. xii. 8, ) and built an altar on Mount Moria, chap. xxii.
                           14. Interpreters are not agreed on which of these places Jacob spent the night. St. Augustine, q. 83, supposes it was on the
                           latter, "where God appointed the tabernacle to remain." The Chaldean paraphrases it very well in this sense, ver. 17, "How
                           terrible is this place! It is not an ordinary place, but a place beloved by God, and over against this place is the door of
                           heaven." (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           of Jacob. (Rabanus, Instit. i. 45.) If pagans did the like, this is no reason why we should condemn the practice. They were
                           blamable for designing thus to worship false gods. (St. Clement of Alexandria, strom. vii; <FONT size=3>Apuleius,</FONT> Florid.

                           was built after his return, was called by the same name. Hence those famous animated stones or idols, received their title
