                           sacred mysteries, and becoming thereby one mystical body with Christ. From whence he infers, (ver. 21.) that they who are
                           made partakers with Christ, by the eucharistic sacrifice, and sacrament, must not be made partakers with devils, by eating

                           all we, being many, are one body, who partake of that one bread.</I> For it is by our communicating with Christ and with one

                           of many grains of corn, closely united together. (Challoner) --- From the sacrament of the real body of Christ in the eucharist,
                           he passeth to the effect of this sacrament, which is to unite all those who partake of it, as members of the same mystical
                           body of Christ, which is his Church: and from hence he presently draws this consequence, that such as are members of that
                           body, of which Christ is the head, cannot have any communication with idolaters, or with those that offer sacrifices to idols
                           and devils. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           all this discourse, a comparison is instituted between the Christian host and oblation, its effects, conditions and properties,
                           with the altars, hosts, sacrifices and immolations of the Jews and Gentiles; which the apostle could not have done, had there
                           not been a proper sacrifice in the Christian worship. The holy Fathers teach the same with the ancient Councils. This in the
                           council of Nice: <I>The lamb of God laid upon the altar.</I> Conc. Ephes., <I>The unbloody service of the sacrifice.</I> In
                           St. Cyril of Alexandria, in Conc. Ephes., Anath. 11, <I>The quickening holy sacrifice; the unbloody host and victim.</I> Tertullian,
                           de coron. milit.,<I> The propitiatory sacrifice both for the living and the dead.</I> This Melchisedech did most singularly
                           prefigure in his mystical oblation of bread and wine; this also according to the prophecy of Malachias, shall continue from
                           the rising to the setting sun, a perpetual substitute for all the Jewish sacrifices; and this, in plain terms, is called the

                           he teaches us, that on some occasions it is necessary to abstain even from things in themselves lawful, as in the case of

                           of any thing, </I>&amp;c. Here at length St. Paul prescribes them a rule by which they were to govern themselves, as to meats
                           that they met with. Buy and eat any thing sold in the market, or of any thing that you meet with at the table of infidels,
                           when they invite you, for all <I>are the Lord's</I> creatures, and may be taken <I>with thanksgiving,</I> as we ought to take
                           whatsoever we eat. --- But <I>if any man say, this hath been sacrificed to idols, do not eat of it for his sake,</I> &amp;c.
                           And why must they not then eat of it? because either he is an infidel that says it: and then by saying so, he may mean that
                           they who eat it, ought to eat it in honour of their gods. Or if a weak brother says so, he thereby signifies, that his conscience
                           judges it not lawful to be eaten; so that in one case, you seem to consent that things are to be taken in honour of idols:
                           in the other, you give offence to your weak brother: and I would have you to be without <I>offence,</I> both to <I>Jews</I>
                           and <I>Gentiles;</I> and not to think it enough that you can eat such things with thanksgiving. It may be asked here why the
                           apostle should not absolutely forbid them ever to eat any thing offered to idols, as this seems a thing absolutely forbidden
                           in the council of Jerusalem? (Acts xv. 23.) To this some answer, that the apostle here expounds the true sense of that decree,
                           which was only to be understood, when eating such meats gave scandal. Others say, the prohibition was only for a short time,
                           and now was out of date. Others take notice, that the prohibition was not general, nor for all places, but only for the new
                           converted Gentiles that were at Antioch, or in Syria and Cilicia, as specified in the decree. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>
