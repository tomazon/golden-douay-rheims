                                    had revolted also from him, he put an end to his life by poison.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And assaulting them with great force, won the holds, killed them that
                                    came in the way, and slew altogether no fewer than twenty thousand.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And whereas some were fled into very strong towers, having all manner

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 Machabeus left Simon and Joseph, and Zacheus, and them that were with
                                    them, in sufficient number to besiege them, and departed to those expeditions which urged more.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 Now they that were with Simon, being led with covetousness, were persuaded
                                    for the sake of money by some that were in the towers: and taking seventy thousand didrachmas, let some of them escape.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 But when it was told Machabeus what was done, he assembled the rulers

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 So he put these traitors to death, and forthwith took the two towers.</font></p>

                                    he slew more than twenty thousand in the two holds.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 But Timotheus, who before had been overcome by the Jews, *having called

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 But Machabeus, and they that were with him, when he drew near, prayed
                                    to the Lord, sprinkling earth upon their heads, and girding their loins with haircloth,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And lying prostrate at the foot of the altar, besought him to be merciful
                                    to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and an adversary to their adversaries, as the law saith.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And so after prayer taking their arms, they went forth further from
                                    the city, and when they were come very near the enemies they rested.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 But as soon as the sun was risen both sides joined battle: the one

                                    leader in battle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 But when they were in the heat of the engagement, there appeared to
                                    the enemies from heaven five men upon horses, comely, with golden bridles, conducting the Jews:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 Two of them took Machabeus between them, and covered him on every

                                    confounded with blindness, and filled with trouble.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 And there were slain twenty thousand five hundred, and six hundred
                                    horsemen.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 But Timotheus fled into Gazara, a strong hold, where Chereas was governor.</font></p>

                                    blasphemed exceedingly, and cast forth abominable words.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 But when the fifth day appeared, twenty young men of them that were
                                    with Machabeus, inflamed in their minds, because of the blasphemy, approached manfully to the wall, and pushing forward with
                                    fierce courage, got up upon it:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 Moreover, others also getting up after them, went to set fire to the
                                    towers and the gates, and to burn the blasphemers alive.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 And having for two days together pillaged and sacked the fortress,
                                    they killed Timotheus, who was found hid in a certain place: they slew also his brother, Chereas, and Apollophanes.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 And when this was done, they blessed the Lord with hymns and thanksgiving,
