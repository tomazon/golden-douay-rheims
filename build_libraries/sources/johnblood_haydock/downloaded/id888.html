                           Alexander, (1 Machabees i. 7,) and the warriors of Sesostris, whose father ordered all the male children who were born on

                           but he adopted their spirit. (Calmet) --- He insinuates that he was twice as old as his father when he began to reign, (Pineda

                           contend with the other tribes (Calmet) with advantage. (Haydock) --- Even at first, Roboam put himself at the head of 180,000

                           is the same with <i>Adoniram,</i> chap. iv. 6. Roboam impudently sent him to appease the people, (Salien) or haughtily to
                           demand the usual tribute; unless the king abandoned him to the fury of the populace, as an object of their horror. The people

                           had retired as soon as Roboam had given his decision. But the people having stoned Aduram, and thus rendered a reconciliation
                           very difficult, Jeroboam was invited to accept the crown. (Calmet) --- As this was conformable to his utmost desires and the

                           as one tribe. (Challoner) --- Perhaps <i>Benjamin</i> at first hesitated; but, considering the greater danger to which it

                           that they resembled the cherubim, and were intended to represent the true God; thus endeavouring to excuse the Israelites
                           from idolatry, on this occasion, as well as when they came out of Egypt, Exodus xxxii. 4. But his arguments are weak, and
                           Jeroboam is constantly condemned as a most wicked and idolatrous prince, chap. xiv. 9., 4 Kings xxiii. 15., and Osee viii.

                           of the subjects of Jeroboam dwelt in it; so that it was the most southern city of his dominions. It had been consecrated by
                           Jacob, (Genesis xxviii. 19.) and was a famous place of devotion, 1 Kings x. 3. Septuagint (Alexandrian) and St. Cyril (in
