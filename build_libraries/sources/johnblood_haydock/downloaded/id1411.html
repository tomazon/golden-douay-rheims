                           He[Josephus] elsewhere (B.[Antiquities?] xx. 8.) asserts that Jonathas was next high priest to Alcimus, who certainly officiated

                           Mat.) and St. Ambrose (Of. i. 41.) highly extols his bravery, in "prefering death before slavery and shame."</font></p><b>

                           The Roman legion consisted of 6726, (Veget.) or 6666. The two phalanxes were in each wing supported by cavalry, which endeavoured

                           <i>Slain.</i> Gorionides relates that the sight of Judas made Bacchides flee towards Azotus. He lost 15,000, when the rest
                           of the army came upon Judas now fatigued; and as Bacchides returned to the charge, the hero fell upon heaps of the slain.
                           Thus died this great man <i>who saved Israel,</i> ver. 21. (Calmet) --- <i>Gloriosiorem triumphis mortem invenit.</i> The
                           most mighty in the sight of men may fall; but the fortitude of Judas, proved by former heroic actions and by success, was
                           now rendered perfect by this most glorious death. (St. Ambrose, Of. i. 41.) (Worthington) <font size="3">--- Never was there
                           a more accomplished and virtuous champion. He had all the qualities of a holy priest and a valiant soldier, as well as of
                           a religious prince, always bent on promoting the glory of his people, chap. iii. 3. He was an admirable copy of Jesus Christ,
                           the great original of all the saints. In the most dismal times he was chosen to save religion and the people. Almost alone,
                           and wandering from place to place, he gains the most signal victories, forms a league with Gentiles, purifies the temple,
                           acts both as high priest and as prince of the nation, and at last gives his life for his brethren. Thus Christ by his life
                           and death unites all in one Church, and procures the remission of sin. (Calmet)</font></font></p><b>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 After this it was told Jonathan, and Simon, his brother, that the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 And Jonathan said to his company: Let us arise, and fight against

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">50 And they built strong cities in Judea, the fortress that was in Jericho,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">59 So they went, and gave him counsel.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">60 And he arose to come with a great army: and he sent secretly letters

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">61 And he apprehended of the men of the country, that were the principal

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">63 And when Bacchides knew it, he gathered together all his multitude:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">64 And he came, and camped above Bethbessen, and fought against it many

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">65 But Jonathan left his brother, Simon, in the city, and went forth

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">66 And struck Odares, and his brethren, and the children of Phaseron,

                                    burnt the engines,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">68 And they fought against Bacchides, and he was discomfited by them:
                                    and they afflicted him exceedingly, for his counsel, and his enterprise was in vain.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">69 And he was angry with the wicked men that had given him counsel to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">70 And Jonathan had knowledge of it, and he sent ambassadors to him to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">71 And he accepted it willingly, and did according to his words, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">72 And he restored to him the prisoners which he before had taken out

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">73 So the sword ceased from Israel: and Jonathan dwelt in Machmas, and
