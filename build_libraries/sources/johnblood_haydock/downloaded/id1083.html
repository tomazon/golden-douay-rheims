                           <i>Buzite,</i> a descendant of Buz, the son of Nachor, Genesis xxii. 21. (Calmet) --- <i>Of,</i> &amp;c. Septuagint, "of the
                           country of Hus." --- <i>Ram.</i> Chaldean, "Abraham;" (Menochius) or rather (Haydock) this is put for <i>Aram.</i> Symmachus,
                           "Syria," 2 Paralipomenon xxii. 5. Some suppose that Eliu sprung from Aram, the son of Esron, of the tribe of Juda. Others
                           think that (Calmet) he was the same with Balaam. (St. Jerome; Ven. Bede) --- He is never ranked among the friends of Job,
                           as he perhaps did not come from a distance. His speech, or good intention, is not condemned by God; and Job seems to have
                           acquiesced in what he said. (Calmet) --- This silence of the latter might rather proceed from a just (Haydock) contempt, as
                           Eliu said nothing to the purpose; many of his observations being palpably false, and others not at all controverted. Yet with
                           his private spirit he comes forth, not much unlike Protestants and Puritans, who pretend that they will overturn the Catholic
                           faith by arguments which have escaped the sagacity of all preceding ages! (Worthington) --- God also did not let Eliu pass
                           entirely unnoticed; but, in one line, showed his displeasure: (chap. xxxviii. 2.; Houbigant) as Job perhaps did likewise,
                           by repeating the same decision, chap. xlii. 3. (Haydock) --- Eliu vainly explains why he had not spoken before. He arraigns
                           Job for asserting his own innocence, though the holy man only maintained that he was not punished thus for his crimes, according
                           to the laws of vindictive justice; (chap. xxvii. 2.) much less did he pretend that he was juster than God, (chap. xxxv. 2.)
                           as his adversary asserts; taking thence occasion to praise the divine wisdom and power, as if Job had called them in question.
                           (Calmet) --- <i>God,</i> whose eyes behold the smallest faults. (Menochius) --- Hebrew, "rather on, or (Haydock) above God."
                           (Calmet) --- This young man, who was learned and proud, is the pattern of those hot disputants who set themselves above their
                           elders. (St. Gregory xxiii. 2.) (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Found.</i> Hebrew, "produced an answer, but had <i>still</i> condemned Job;" (Haydock) or, "had made Job wicked," by giving
                           him occasion to blaspheme, in order to defend his own righteousness. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "they took it for granted (or
                           laid it down as a fact, <i><u>ethento</u></i>) that he was a wretch." This was not true: (Haydock) but they had also done
                           their best to prove it. (Calmet) --- <i>Job.</i> Almost all the Rabbins assert that the original copies read <i>Jehova,</i>
                           "the Lord;" (Haydock) and that the Masorets changed it, to avoid the apparent blasphemy; as if the three friends had rendered
                           themselves guilty by not answering Job. But the Chaldean, &amp;c., are silent on this head, and Abenezra allows that the change
                           is very doubtful. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           Job has addressed himself to you; (Calmet) but I shall not answer him as you have done. (Menochius) --- Those who neither
