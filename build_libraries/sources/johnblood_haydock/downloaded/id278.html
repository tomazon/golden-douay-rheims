                           to think that the teachers they met with in those days had a good spirit, were of God, if they confessed and acknowledged
                           Jesus Christ to have come from heaven and to have been made flesh, or made man; i.e. to be truly God and truly man. But if
                           (ver. 3) they met with teachers of such a spirit as <I>dissolveth Jesus,</I>[1] by denying him either to be the Messias or
                           to be truly God, or to be a true man, they might conclude for certain that such men had not a true spirit, but were heretics,
                           antichrists, and forerunners of the great antichrist. Such, even in St. John's time, was Simon the magician, who, according
                           to St. Epiphanius, (hær. xxi. p. 55. Ed Petav.) pretended among his countrymen, the Samaritans, that he himself was God the
                           Father, and among the Jews that he was God the Son, and that Jesus suffered death in appearance only. His disciple also, Menander,
                           said he was sent from heaven for the salvation of men. See St. Epiphanius, hær. xxii. p. 61. 3. Cerinthus, as also Carpocras,
                           held that Jesus was a mere man, born of Joseph and Mary, and also different from Christ. See St. Epiphanius, hær. xxxvii.
                           and xxix. p. 102. and 110. 4. Ebion held much the same. See the same St. Epiphanius, hær. xxx. p. 142. These heretics and
                           divers of their followers divided Jesus, and destroyed the faith and mystery of the incarnation. (Witham) --- <I>Every spirit
                           which confesseth,</I> &amp;c. Not that the confession of this point of faith alone, is at all times and in all cases sufficient;
                           but that with relation to that time, and for that part of the Christian doctrine, which was then particularly to be confessed,
                           taught, and maintained against the heretics of those days, this was the most proper token by which the true teachers might
                           be distinguished from the false. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           us love one another.</I> This is the repeated admonition of St. John, the evangelist, both in this epistle and to the end
                           of his life, as St. Jerome relates in his Epist. ad Galat. (cap. vi. tom. 4, part 1, p. 414) that the apostle being very old,
                           and when carried to Church meetings of the Christians, being desired to give them some exhortation, he scarce said any thing,
                           but "love one another;" and it being tedious to his disciples to hear always the same thing, they desired some other instruction,
                           to whom (says St. Jerome) he gave this answer, worthy of St. John: that this was the precept of our Lord, and that if complied
                           with, it was sufficient. --- <I>Charity is of God,</I> is love, is the fountain and source of all goodness and mercy, infinitely
                           good in himself, and in his love and mercy towards mankind. This love and charity of God hath appeared by his sending his
                           only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. See John i. 14. --- Thus God having <I>first loved us,</I>
                           (ver. 10) when we were sinners, and his enemies, let us not be so ungrateful as not to love him, and to love one another after
                           his example. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           that loveth not his brother, whom he seeth, how can he love God, whom he seeth not?</I> By this is signified, that it is more
                           easy and natural to love the things that we see, and that enter by the senses. Pretend not then to love the invisible God,
                           whose perfections are hidden from you in this life, unless you love your brother whom you see. But he adds another reason
                           to prove that no man can love God unless he love his brother; because saith he, (ver. 21.) this is God's express command,
                           <I>that he who loveth God love also his brother:</I> so that a man cannot love God unless he also love his neighbour. (Witham)</FONT></P>
