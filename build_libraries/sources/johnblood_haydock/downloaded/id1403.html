                           <p><strong>Notes &amp; Commentary:</strong></p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 1.</b> <i>Now.</i> Literally, "And." (Haydock) --- Thus many Hebrew books commence, as Exodus, Josue, Baruch,
                           &amp;c. (Calmet) --- <i>Greece,</i> over the whole. He was chosen generalissimo. (Haydock) --- He conquered many of the Greeks,
                           and overthrew Darius Condomanus, the year of the world 3674. (Calmet) --- His dominion in Syria may be meant. (Grotius) ---
                           Alexander [the Great] was the first who reigned in that great monarchy, which he founded. (Worthington)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 2.</b> <i>Holds.</i> He was never defeated. (Just. xii.)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 3.</b> <i>Earth,</i> even to India, beyond which the ancients knew of nothing. --- <i>Quiet,</i> or silent;
                           depopulated, (Isaias xiv. 7.) and obedient, Habacuc ii. 20.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 4.</b> <i>Up.</i> He was spoiled by prosperity, (Calmet) and would pass for a god, and be styled "king of the
                           world." (Just. xii.)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 6.</b> <i>Bed.</i> Some suppose through poison, (Diodorus xvii.; St. Jerome, ad Lætam.) or excess of wine.
                           (Atheneus x. 11.) --- This was enough. (Haydock) --- So perished the man who would claim divine honours! (Calmet)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 7.</b> <i>Servants.</i> On the ninth day of sickness which preceded his death, he admitted all his soldiers
                           to kiss his hand. Then he asked his friends, if they thought they should find such another king? As they were silent, he predicted
                           what bloodshed would ensue, and told them to bury him in the temple of Ammon. When they asked to whom he left the throne,
                           he said, "to the most worthy." He gave his ring to Perdiccas; whence all inferred, that he should be regent till the proper
                           heirs came of age. Perdiccas desired to know when he would have divine honours: to which Alexander [the Great] replied with
                           these his last words, "when you are happy:" (Just. xii.; Diodorus xvii.) as much as to say, never. (Haydock) --- This seems
                           contrary to the sacred historian. But his authority is far superior. (Calmet) --- <i>Kingdom.</i> This is otherwise by Q.
                           Curtius; though he acknowledges that divers were of that opinion, and that it had been delivered by some authors. (liber[book]
                           x.) But here we find from the sacred text that he was in error. (Challoner) --- By delivering his ring to Perdiccas, Alexander
                           gave him authority to make this division. (Worthington) --- Many assert, that he gave him directions in his last will. This
                           was observed for some time, ver. 10.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 8.</b> <i>Twelve.</i> Josephus, &amp;c. Some add, a few months. He was about thirty-three years old.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 10.</b> <i>Death,</i> twelve years being expired, when all the posterity of Alexander [the Great] were dead.
                           His generals gradually destroyed each other, and four took the diadem at the same time: Ptolemy, in Egypt; Seleucus, in Syria;
                           Cassander, in Macedonia; and Lysimachus, in Thrace. (Just. xiii., and xv.) (Calmet) --- Those who choose to read in order,
                           may, after the preface [in] 2 Machabees ii. 20., read the above, then 2 Machabees iii. 1. (Worthington)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 11.</b> <i>Antiochus the illustrious;</i> Epiphanes, the younger son of Antiochus the great, who usurped the
                           kingdom, to the prejudice of his nephew Demetrius, son of his elder brother, Seleucus Philopater. (Challoner) --- Epiphanes
                           means "renowed." (Worthington) --- He took this title, particularly after the Samaritans had offered it to him. (Josephus,
                           Antiquities xii.; Vaillant. A. 145.) --- His medals have always <i>God</i> prefixed, "the god appearing;" as he came opportunely,
                           like a god, to defend the kingdom against the Egyptians, after he had been fourteen years a hostage at Rome. (Calmet) ---
                           Nothing could be more abject than his character. (St. Jerome, in Daniel viii., and ix.) (Atheneus v. 4., and x. 12.) --- <i>Greeks,</i>
                           counting not from the beginning of the reign of Alexander [the Great], but from the first year of Seleucus Nicator. (Challoner)
                           --- The era of the Seleucides began in spring or autumn, the year of the world 3692, the year before Christ 312, though the
                           Chaldeans and Ptolemy date from the following spring. (Calmet) --- The Grecian monarchy had then stood twenty years. (Eusebius)
                           (Worthington)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 12.</b> <i>Men.</i> Jason attempted to supplant Onias III and introduced pagan customs, when he was dead. Menelaus
                           treated him in like manner. Being cited to pay what he had promised, he left Lysimachus in his place, who was slain in the
                           temple, which he was robbing, 2 Machabees iv. --- <i>Us.</i> Thus the Jews complained in the days of Jeremias, (xliv. 18.)
                           and the Christian religion was blamed for all the miseries which fell upon the Roman empire. (Calmet) --- St. Augustine proves
                           in his City of God, that this accusation was false. (Haydock)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 15.</b> <i>Exercise,</i> to wrestle (Calmet) and teach. (Lyranus)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 16.</b> <i>Made.</i> St. Jerome thinks the attempt useless. But the Jews discovered the art. (St. Epiphanius;
                           Pond. xvi.; Bartol.) (1 Corinthians vii. 18.) --- <i>Sold</i> to the devil, becoming his instruments, 3 Kings xxi. 25., and
                           Romans vii. 14. (Calmet) --- Go to 2 Machabees iv. 7.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 17.</b> <i>Egypt.</i> He coveted this kingdom, having Syria already. (Worthington) --- He was not very fit
                           for war: but Egypt was not under Philometor a child, and Ephphanes made an easy conquest. This was his second visit to that
                           country. While he besieged Alexandria, a report of his death was spread; and as he was informed that the Jews rejoiced at
                           it, he fell upon them, ver. 21. (Calmet) --- After ver. 20, read 2 Machabees iv. 21. (Worthington)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 23.</b> <i>Sanctuary.</i> Josephus (Antiquities xii. 6.) writes, that Antiochus slew such as opposed his entrance
                           into the city, and afterwards those who opened the gates, but would have prevented his plundering the temple. (Worthington)
                           --- Menelaus conducted the king, 2 Machabees v. 15. Profane authors condemn this conduct of the king towards a city subject
                           to him. (Josephus, contra Apion 2.) --- Diodorus relates several fables on this occasion. (Calmet)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 30.</b> <i>The chief collector,</i> &amp;c. Apollonius. (Challoner) (2 Machabees v. 24.) (Worthington) ---
                           He basely fell upon the unsuspecting citizens on a sabbath day. (Haydock)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 33.</b> <i>Fire,</i> thus destroying a great part. (Josephus, Antiquities xii. 7.)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 35.</b> <i>The city of David.</i> That is, the castle of Sion. (Challoner) --- In it was placed a garrison
                           of Macedonians. (Worthington) --- This castle had been occupied by Syrians before. It was now enlarged, 2 Machabees iv. 27.,
                           and v. 5.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 38.</b> <i>Sanctuary,</i> to pillage all who came to the temple. (Calmet) --- <i>An evil devil.</i> Literally,
                           an adversary, watching constantly to do harm, as the evil spirit is always watching and seeking whom he could devour. (Challoner)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 40.</b> <i>Fled</i> with Judas, &amp;c. (2 Machabees v.) Josephus (Antiquities xii. 7.) assures us that the
                           Samaritans flattered Epiphanes, and begged their temple might be consecrated to Jupiter, &amp;c. They pretended that they
                           were of Sidonian extraction.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 43.</b> <i>Be one.</i> This reason herself teaches. But the king wished to establish a false religion, or rather
                           he desired to root out all religion, and to shew his authority. (Haydock) --- <i>Demere superstitionem &amp; mores Græcorum
                           dare adnixus.</i> (Tacitus v.) --- He was not content with plunder, unless he ruined souls. (Worthington)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 45.</b> <i>Service,</i> or worship, (Calmet) introduced by Epiphanes. (Haydock)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 49.</b> <i>People.</i> He forced them to eat forbidden meat.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 57.</b> <i>Fifteenth.</i> In all other places the 25th, whence this may be incorrect, (Calmet) or the altar
                           was now set up, (Haydock) though sacrifices were not yet offered. (Calmet) --- <i>Idol.</i> The statue of Jupiter Olympius,
