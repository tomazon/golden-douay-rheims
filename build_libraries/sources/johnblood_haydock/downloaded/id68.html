                           collating the present narrative with that of St. Matthew it appears that Jesus Christ was not tempted till the expiration
                           of forty days. (Bible de Vence) --- Many reasons may be assigned why Christ permitted himself to be tempted. 1st. To merit
                           for man the grace of overcoming temptations. 2d. To encourage us under temptations. 3d. To teach us not to be cast down with
                           temptations, however grievous they may be, since even Jesus Christ submitted to them. 4thly. To point out to us the manner
                           in which we ought to behave in time of temptation. (Dionysius)</FONT></P><B>

                           have the devil here again citing Scripture, (Psalm xc. ver. 11.) (Read what is given on this subject in note on ver. 6, chap.
                           iv. of St. Matthew's gospel) which shews how very dangerous a thing it is to put the Scripture, in the first instance, indiscriminately
                           into every, even the most illiterate person's hands, without any previous disposition of the mind and heart, by study and
                           prayer. How much more satisfactory must it be to be guided by the Church of God, which Christ has promised to secure against
                           all error, and which he commands all to obey! How much more rational to begin with distributing elementary catechisms, approved
                           by the Catholic Church as conformable to the word of God, and then only opening to them the sacred mystic book, when their
                           minds and hearts are better prepared to avail themselves of the inestimable treasure, and of justly appreciating and exploring
                           the golden lore. If humility be a virtue that renders us most pleasing to God, it is a virtue particularly necessary for the
                           proper understanding of Holy Writ. This will teach us to submit (whenever the Scripture is either silent or obscure in points
                           of faith) our own private and unassisted judgment to the judgment and comments of the Church. This was the sentiment of a
                           great philosopher of this nation, who, when charged with scepticism and a love of novelty by his contemporaries, replied:
                           "However fanciful I may be esteemed in matters of philosophy, in religious concerns I like to go the beaten road. Where the
                           Scripture is silent, the Church is my text. Where that speaks, it is but the comment; and I never refer any thing to the arbitration
                           of my own judgment, but in the silence of them both."</FONT></P><B>

                           he could not overcome with sensuality, covetousness, or vanity. The devil now deals with men in the same manner. He tempts
                           them, and, being overcome, leaves them for a time, to prompt them to rest in a fatal security; that indulging indolence, they
                           may at some future period be attacked, with greater certainty of success, when unprepared. Knowing, therefore, the trick and
                           design of our infernal enemy, how much does it behove us to be on our guard; and having overcome in one temptation, prepare
                           ourselves for another; never resting in the presumptuous thought, that we are sufficiently strong in virtue to resist the
                           enemy, without fresh preparation. (Dionysius) --- This history of the various temptations to which our Saviour subjects himself,
                           as related by St. Luke, is exactly the same as that given by St. Matthew with this only difference, that the order in which
                           the temptations took place is not the same in both evangelists: but it does not matter what order is observed, where all the
                           circumstances are related. (St. Augustine)</FONT></P><B>

                           wished to shew that Christ worked a miracle on this occasion, and by it proved his divinity. This is the opinion of Sts. Euthymius,
                           Ambrose, and Thomas Aquinas. St. Ambrose says, we must observe that Christ did not suffer from necessity, but because he wished
                           it. He was not taken by the Jews, but delivered up himself; at his own pleasure he is seized, and at his own pleasure he escapes;
                           when he wills it, he is condemned; and when he wills it, he is freed. The most common opinion is, that he rendered himself
                           invisible on this occasion; though others imagine that he changed their wills, or withheld their hands. (Maldonatus) --- When
                           we observe the outrageous treatment Jesus Christ met with from the people of Nazareth, we are not surprised that he should
                           shut up the fountain of his beneficence against them for their incredulity, and return to Capharnaum. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           preaches therefore in the synagogue, according as Isaias had declared of him, and struck amazement into every heart. The Jews
                           themselves considered him as something very extraordinary; as one of the prophets, or ancient saints. But Christ, that they
                           might conceive a higher opinion of his person, does not make use of the expressions they did, but speaks as Lord and Master
