                           Messiah promised to the Jews: and though he knew him to be innocent, he connived the more at his death through fear lest he
                           might attempt something against the Roman empire, if he were permitted to continue. At the same time, by putting up his cause,
                           he wished to revenge himself of the Jews, for their importunity and obstinacy in compelling him, partly against his will,
                           to condemn him to death. For what could be more ignominious to the Jews than to see their king crucified at their own request,
                           and for no other reason than because he was their king, and they did not wish him to reign over them. Thus did they receive
                           the king for whose coming they had so long sighed, and from whom they had expected delivery from the Roman yoke, and the subjugation

                           the least word. Although Jesus was truly the natural, not the adoptive, Son of God, it is nevertheless probable that the centurion,
                           being a Gentile, did not speak in this manner as if he knew Jesus to be the natural Son of God. He did not know that the Son
                           of God was really true God, equal to the Father, but called him Son of God, as if adopted, on account of his extraordinary
                           sanctity; or, perhaps, he might have called him the Son of God, in order to oppose the Jews, who called our Saviour a blasphemer,
