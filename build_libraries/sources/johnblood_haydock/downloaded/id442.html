                           of Chanaan, at which time these feasts began to be observed. (Menochius) See Leviticus ii. 14. --- Before the harvest commenced,
                           first-fruits were offered to the Lord. A gomer containing about three pints of barley was given to the priests, by the nation
                           at large, as each individual was not bound to make a particular solemn offering. The judges deputed three men to gather this
                           barley on the evening of the 15th [of] Nisan, where the neighbourhood assembled near Jerusalem. It was gathered by them in
                           three different fields, after having been thrice assured that the sun was set, and that they had leave to reap, in answer
                           to their triple demands on each head. Then they placed the ears in three boxes, which they brought to the court of the sanctuary,
                           and having ground the barley, and poured a log of oil and an handful of incense upon it, presented it to the priest, who heaving
                           it in the form of a cross, threw as much as he could hold in his hand upon the altar, and kept the rest for himself. (Josephus,
                           [Antiquities?] iii. 10; &amp;c. Private people offered also in kind or in money their first-fruits, or between the 40th and
                           the 60th part of what their land produced. This custom is almost as ancient as the world, (Genesis iv. 3,) and we may say
                           that it forms a part of natural religion, which all nations have observed. Porphyrius esteems it an impiety to neglect it.
                           He says that the Thoes, living on the borders of Thrace, were in a moment destroyed, because they offered neither sacrifices
                           nor first-fruits. (De Abstin. ii. 7.) The ancient Romans and Greeks were very punctual in this respect. (Pliny, xviii. 20.)
                           Those officers who collected the first-fruits among the latter were styled <I>Parasites.</I> Many of the festivals among the
                           heathens, occurred at the end of harvest. (Aristotle, ad Nicom. viii.) The Jews might reap their wheat, but they could not
                           taste it, before they had offered the first-fruits, at Pentecost. (Chap. xxiii. 17; Exodus xxiii. 16.) --- <I>Of ears.</I>

                           and the next day was Pentecost. (Menochius) --- They began, therefore, to count on the 16th of Nisan, and end on the 6th of
                           the third month Sivan. All the intermediate days took their denomination from this second day of the Passover; so that the
                           next Saturday was called <I>the first sabbath after the second day;</I> in Greek <I>Deuteroproton,</I> the second-first; (Luke
                           vi. 1,) a term which had puzzled all the interpreters until Jos. Scaliger made this discovery. (Emend. vi.) The Samaritans
                           count from the day after that sabbath which follows the Passover; so that if the festival fall on Monday, they celebrate Pentecost
                           later than the Jews. See their Letter to Huntington. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           or a memorable sabbath. This third great festival sanctified the commencement of the civil year in Tisri, the sabbatical month,
                           according to the ecclesiastical calculation. (Tirinus) See Numbers xxix. 3. --- The sound of trumpets, which ushered in the
                           year with great solemnity, reminded the Jews of the approaching fast, ver. 27, (Maimonides) and of those terrible sounds which
                           had been heard at Sinai. (Theodoret, q. 32.) The Rabbins say that a ram's horn was used, because Abraham had sacrificed a
                           ram instead of his son. (Genesis xxii. 11.; Zacharias ix. 14.) The Jews on this day sound the horn 30 times, feast, and wish
                           one another a happy year. (Boxtorf, xyn. xix.) We know not on what account this festival was instituted. But it was probably
                           ordained in order that the people might learn to thank God for the favours received during the past year, and might beg his
                           blessing on that, upon which they were now entering. (Calmet) </FONT></P><B>

                           It was difficult for any grown-up person to be entirely guiltless, amid such a variety of precepts, (Menochius) which St.

                           for the injury done to God by their fellow-members. See Daniel ix. 5. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           10,) says, they took branches of myrtle, willows, and palm trees, on which they fixed oranges. This is the fruit which the
                           Hebrews generally understand to be hereby designated. In the same sense the Arabic and Syriac translate "golden apples." ---

                           only meant, that these branches should be used in forming the tents; but the Jews hold them in their hands, while they go
                           in solemn procession round the pulpit in their synagogues, during every day of the octave, before breakfast, crying out <I>Ana
                           hosiah na,</I> &amp;c., "Save us we beseech thee, O Lord; we beseech thee, grant us good success." They gave the title of
                           hosannah to those branches; in allusion to which, the children sung in honour of Jesus Christ, <I>Hosanna to the Son of David.</I>

                           thus attaching to his worship a carnal people, by intermingling with the most solemn ceremonies some relaxation and pleasure.
                           By calling them together so often in the year, they became also better acquainted with one another, and more in love with
                           their religion and country. The ancient lawgivers entertained the like sentiments. (Seneca, Strabo x.) But the pagans generally
                           carried these diversions to excess. (Calmet) --- In this chapter we find six festivals specified: 1. sabbath; 2. Passover;
                           3. Pentecost; 4. trumpets; 5. expiation; 6. tabernacles, lasting till the octave day of assembly and collection. These three
                           last were celebrated in the 7th month, the 1st of the civil year. There was also a feast on all the new moons, Numbers xxviii.

                           In the institution of these feasts, as in the other regulations of Moses, there was something ceremonial, which might be altered,
                           and something moral, which regards even those times when the Jewish religion was to cease. (St. Augustine, q. 43.) --- Hence
                           we must conclude, that the obligation of keeping certain days holy, must always remain. But those appointed for the Jews,
                           as they foretold the future Messias, must be changed, lest otherwise we might seem to confess that he is still to come. (Romans
                           xiv.; Galatians iv.; Colossians ii.) We are not therefore allowed to <I>Judaize abstaining from work</I> on the Jewish sabbath,
                           (Council of Laodicea,) as Antichrist will require. (St. Gregory, ep. xi. 3.) --- But we must keep Sunday instead, (as even
                           Protestants maintain, though there be no Scripture for it) by authority of tradition, in memory of Christ's resurrection,
                           &amp;c. (St. Jerome, ep. ad Hed. ib.[ibid.?, St. Gregory, ep. xi. 3.?]; St. Augustine, de C.[City of God?] xxii. 30.) So also
                           we observe the Christian festivals, in honour of our Lord and his saints, instead of those which God appointed for the Jews,
                           either by himself or by his ministers: for we find that some were instituted after the time of Moses, (Esther ix., and 1 Machabees
                           iv.) and these were sanctioned by the observance of Christ himself, <I>It was the feast of the dedication, and Jesus walked
                           in the temple,</I> &amp;c., John x. 22-23. (Worthington)</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2 face=Arial>
