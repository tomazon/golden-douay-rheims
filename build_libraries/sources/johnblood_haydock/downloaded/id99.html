                           St. John does not usually relate what is mentioned by the other evangelists, especially what happened in Galilee. If he does
                           it on this occasion, it is purposely to introduce the subject of the heavenly bread, which begins ver. 37. He seems, moreover,
                           to have had in view the description of the different passovers during Christ's public ministry. As he, therefore, remained
                           in Galilee during the third passover, he relates pretty fully what passed during that time. We may also remark, that as the
                           other three evangelists give, in the same terms, the institution of the blessed sacrament, St. John omits the institution,
                           but gives in detail the repeated promises of Jesus Christ, relative to this great mystery.</FONT></P><B>

                           not to seek for their temporal prosperity, but for their eternal welfare. The Church is daily filled, says St. Augustine,
                           with those who come to petition for temporal advantages, that they may escape this calamity, obtain that advantage in their
                           temporal concerns: but there is scarce one to be found who seeks for Christ, and pays him his adoration, through the pure

                           you have only given us bread; where then is the food that perishes not? Christ therefore answers them, that the food which
                           Moses gave them, was not the true manna from heaven, but that it was only a figure of himself, who came down from heaven to
                           give life to the world. (St. Augustine) --- St. Chrysostom observes, that the Jews here acknowledge Christ to be God, since

                           which he knows will prove a stumbling block to many. The chapter begins with the miraculous multiplication of the loaves;
                           then Christ walking on the sea; next he blames the Jews for following him not through faith in his miracles, but for the loaves
                           and fishes, and tells them to labour for that nourishment which perishes not, by believing in Him, whom the Father had sent;

                           <I>The bread which I will give, is my flesh for the life of the world.</I>[2] In most Greek copies we read, <I>is my flesh
                           which I will give for the life of the world.</I> Christ here promised what he afterwards instituted, and gave at his last

                           would give on the cross for the redemption of the world. The Jews of Capharnaum were presently scandalized. <I>How</I> (said
                           they) <I>can this man give us his flesh to eat?</I> But notwithstanding their murmuring, and the offence which his words had
                           given, even to <I>many</I> of his disciples, he was so far from revoking, or expounding what he had said of any figurative
                           or metaphorical sense, that he confirmed the same truth in the clearest and strongest terms. <I>Amen, amen, I say to you,
                           unless you eat, </I>&amp;c. And again, (ver. 56.) <I>For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</I> I cannot
                           omit taking notice of what St. Chrysostom and St. Cyril, in their commentaries on this place, have left us on these words,
                           <I>How can this man do this?</I> These words which call in question the almighty and incomprehensible power of God, which
                           hinder them, says St. Chrysostom, from believing all other mysteries and miracles: they might as well have said: <I>How</I>
                           could he with five loaves feed five thousand men? This question, <I>How can he do this?</I> Is a question of infidels and
                           unbelievers. St. Cyril says that <I>How,</I> or, <I>How can he do this?</I> cannot, without folly, be applied to God. 2ndly,
                           he calls it a question of <I>blasphemy.</I> 3rdly, a <I>Jewish word,</I> for which these Capharnaites deserved the severest
                           punishments. 4thly, He confutes them by the saying of the prophet Isaias, (lv. 9.) that God's <I>thoughts</I> and <I>ways</I>
                           are as much above those of men, as the <I>heavens</I> are <I>above the earth.</I> But if these Capharnaites, who knew not
                           who Jesus was, were justly blamed for their <I>incredulous, foolish, blasphemous, Jewish </I>saying, <I>how can he give us
                           his flesh to eat?</I> much more blameable are those Christians, who, against the words of the Scripture, against the unanimous
                           consent and authority of all Christian Churches in all parts of the world, refuse to believe his real presence, and have nothing
                           to say, but with the obstinate Capharnaites, <I>how can this be done?</I> Their answers are the same, or no better, when they
                           tell us that the real presence contradicts their senses, their reason, that they <I>know</I> it to be false. We may also observe,
                           with divers interpreters, that if Christians are not to believe that Jesus Christ is one and the same God with the eternal
                           Father, and that he is truly and really present in the holy sacrament of the Eucharist, it will be hard to deny but that Christ
                           himself led men into these errors, which is blasphemy. For it is evident, and past all dispute, that the Jews murmured, complained,
                           and understood that Christ several times <I>made himself God, and equal to the Father </I>of all. 2ndly, When in this chapter,
                           he told them he would give them <I>his flesh to eat,</I> &amp;c. they were shocked to the highest degree: they cried out,
                           this <I>could not be,</I> that these words and this speech was <I>hard and harsh,</I> and on this very account <I>many</I>
                           that had been his disciples till that time, <I>withdrew themselves</I> from him, and left him and his doctrine. Was it not
                           then at least high time to set his complaining hearers right, to prevent the <I>blasphemous</I> and <I>idolatrous opinions</I>
                           of the following ages, nay even of all Christian Churches, by telling his disciples at least, that he was only <I>a nominal
                           God,</I> in a <I>metaphorical</I> and <I>improper sense;</I> that he spoke only of his body being <I>present</I> in a <I>figurative</I>
                           and <I>metaphorical sense</I> in the holy Eucharist? If we are deceived, who was it that deceived us but Christ himself, who
                           so often repeated the same points of our belief? His apostles must be esteemed no less guilty in affirming the very same,
                           both as to Christ's divinity, and his real presence in the holy sacrament, as hereafter will appear. (Witham) --- Compare
                           the words here spoken with those he delivered at his last supper, and you will see that what he promises here was then fulfilled:
                           "this is my body given for you." Hence, the holy Fathers have always explained this chapter of St. John, as spoken of the

                           so leaves them to their free choice. (Witham) --- Jesus Christ remarking in the previous verse that the apostate disciples
                           had left him, to walk no more with him, turning to the twelve, asks them, <I>Will you also go away?</I> The twelve had heard
                           all that passed; they had seen the Jews strive amongst themselves, and the disciples murmur and leave their Master; they understood
                           what he said in the same literal sense; it could, indeed, bear no other meaning; but when Jesus put the above question to
                           them, leaving them to their free choice, whether to follow him, or to withdraw themselves, Simon Peter answered him: "Lord,
                           to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life;" and therefore art able to make good thy words, however hard and
                           difficult they may appear to others. --- We may here admire not only the excellency of their faith, but the plain, yet noble
                           motive of their faith: they believe, because he is Christ, the Son of God, (or, as it is in the Greek, the Son of the <I>living
                           God</I>) who is absolutely incapable of deceiving his creatures, and whose power is perfectly equal to perform the promises
                           he here makes them.</FONT></P><B>

                           <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">If we take into consideration all the circumstances of this chapter, it
                           will be difficult to conceive how any person can bring their mind to think that there is no connexion between this chapter
                           and the institution of the blessed sacrament. It must proceed, as Dr. Clever, the Protestant Bishop of Bangor, affirms, "from
                           the fear of giving advantage to the doctrine of transubstantiation." He moreover adds: "whilst the institution is considered
                           as a memorial only, nothing can well be further from being plain." See his Sermon on the Lord's Supper. The holy Fathers have
                           unanimously understood these repeated promises of Christ with a reference to the institution. St. Cyprian, of the third age[century],
                           quoting the promises of Christ, <I>the bread which I will give, is my flesh, for the life of the world,</I> deduces this conclusion:
                           "Hence it is manifest, that they have this life, who touch his body, and receive the Eucharist." Qui corpus ejus attingunt.
                           (De Orat. Dom. p. 147.) St. Hilary, of the fourth age[century], quoting Christ's words, says: "there is no place left to doubt
                           of the truth of Christ's flesh and blood, de veritate carnis et sanguinis non relictus est ambigendi locus; for now, by the
                           profession of the Lord himself, and according to our belief, it is truly flesh and truly blood." (De Trin. lib. viii. p. 954-6.)
                           St. Basil, of the fourth century also, citing ver. 53 and 54 of this chapter, says: "about the things that God has spoken
                           there should be no hesitation, nor doubt, but a firm persuasion that all is true and possible, though nature be against it:&nbsp;<I><U>Kan
                           e phusis machetai</U>.</I> Herein lies the struggle of faith." (Reg. viii. Moral. t. 2, p. 240.) Again the same saint says:
                           "it is very profitable every day, to partake of the body and blood of Christ,&nbsp;<I><U>phagein to soma kai piein to aima
                           tou kuriou emon</U>,</I> <I>for he that eateth my flesh.</I> &amp;c. (John vi. 55.) --- "We communicate four times in the
                           week; on Sunday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, and on the other days, if there be a commemoration of any saint." (Ep. xcii.
                           t. 3, p. 186.) --- St. Ambrose, of the same age, says: "the manna in the desert was given in figure. You have known things
                           more excellent. For light is preferable to the shadow; truth to the figure; the body of Christ to the manna of heaven. But
                           you may say: I see somewhat else: how do you assert that I shall receive the body of Christ?" He gives this answer: "How much
                           more powerful is the virtue of the divine blessing, than that of nature; because by the former, nature itself is changed?
                           ... If the blessing of men (he here instances Moses changing a rod into a serpent, and many other miraculous changes) was
                           powerful enough to change nature, what must we not say of the divine consecration, when the very words of the Lord operate?
                           For that sacrament which you receive, is accomplished by the word of Christ. If the word of Elias could call down fire from
                           heaven, shall not the word of Christ be able to change the outward elements? ... The word of Christ could draw out of nothing
                           what was not, shall it not be able to change the things that are into that which they were not? ... Was the order of nature
                           followed when Jesus was born of a Virgin? Certainly not. Then why is that order to be looked for here? It was the true flesh
                           of Christ, which was crucified, which was buried; and this is truly the sacrament of his flesh ... Our Lord himself proclaims,
                           <I>This is my body."</I> --- If Jesus Christ, during his public ministry, performed so many visible and palpable miracles
                           as we read of in the gospels, was it not to induce us to believe without doubting the truths that escape our senses, and surpass
                           our reason? If we believe the water was changed into wine at the marriage feast of Cana; if we believe that the bread in the
                           hands of Christ and his apostles was not diminished, by being broken and divided among five thousand, why cannot we believe
                           the miracle of the Eucharist on the authority of Christ's word, "the bread that I will give you, is my flesh? This is my body,"
                           &amp;c. Not one of all the ancient Fathers has ever denied the real presence; not one of them all has ever said, that the
                           body of Jesus Christ is received in figure only.</FONT></P>
