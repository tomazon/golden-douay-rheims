                           place, and designate the abode of the blessed. In order to understand the language of the apostle, we must observe that the
                           Hebrews distinguished three different heavens. The first comprised the air, the clouds, &amp;c. as far as the fixed stars.
                           The second included all the fixed stars; and the third was the abode of Angels, in which God himself discovered his infinite
                           glory, &amp;c. The first is called in Scripture simply the heavens, the second the firmament, and the third&nbsp;the heaven
                           of heavens. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           sting of my flesh,</I>[1] <I>an angel,</I> or a messenger <I>of Satan,</I> to <I>buffet me.</I> The Latin word signifies any
                           thing that pricks or stings, the Greek word a sharp stick or pale: he speaks by a metaphor, as also when he says <I>to buffet
                           me;</I> that is, by causing great trouble or pain. Some understand by it a violent headache or pain, or distemper in the body.
                           St. Augustine mentions this opinion, and does not reject it, in Psalm xcviii. tom. 4. p. 1069.; in Psalm cxxx. p. 1465. St.
                           Jerome also speaks of it in chap. iv. ad Galatas, tom. 4. p. 274, Ed. Ben. But St. Chrysostom, by the sting, and the angel
                           of Satan, understands that opposition which St. Paul met with from his enemies, and those of the gospel; as Satan signifies
                           an adversary. Others understand troublesome temptations of the flesh, immodest thoughts, and representations, suggested by
                           the devil, and permitted by Almighty God for his greater good. --- <I>Thrice I besought the Lord.</I> That is, many times,
                           to be freed from it, but received only this answer from God, that his grace was sufficient to preserve me from consenting
                           to sin. And that <I>power</I> and strength in virtue should increase, and be <I>perfected</I> in <I>weakness,</I> and by temptations,
                           when they are resisted. St. Augustine seems to favour this exposition, in Psalm lviii. Conc. 2. p. 573. St. Jerome, in his
                           letters to Eustochium, to Demetrias, and to Rusticus, the monk. And it is the opinion of St. Gregory, lib. 23. moral. tom.
                           1. p. 747. and of many others. (Witham) --- If there were any danger of pride from his revelations, the base and filthy suggestions
                           of the enemy of souls must cause humiliations, and make him blush. But these are to be borne with submission to the will of
                           God, for his power is more evident in supporting man under the greatest trials, than in freeing him from the attacks. ---
                           <I>Power is made perfect.</I> The strength and power of God more perfectly shines forth in our weakness and infirmity; as
                           the more weak we are of ourselves, the more illustrious is his grace in supporting us, and giving us the victory under all
                           trials and conflicts. (Challoner) --- <I>When I am weak.</I> The more I suffer for Christ, the more I perceive the effects
                           of his all-powerful grace, which sustains, enlightens, and strengthens me: the more also the glory and power of God appeareth
                           in me. The pagans themselves were not ignorant that calamity was the soil in which virtue usually grows to perfection. Calamitas
                           virtutis occasio est. (Seneca) --- Optimos nos esse dum infirmi sumus. (Pliny vii. ep. 26.)</FONT></P><B>

                           remaining with them 18 months. (Acts chap. xviii.) He came the second time in 55, but did not remain long with them; on which
                           account it is omitted by St. Luke in the Acts. The date of this letter is in 57, when St. Paul again came to them towards
                           the end of the year. (Calmet) --- Other interpreters, with no less authority question this sentiment, see ver. 1. of the following
                           chapter, and say he only went twice; the first time as mentioned in Acts xviii. 1.; the second time, as we may draw from Acts
                           xx. 2 and 3, after this epistle, as it is evident from comparing 2 Corinthians i. 15.</FONT></P><B>
