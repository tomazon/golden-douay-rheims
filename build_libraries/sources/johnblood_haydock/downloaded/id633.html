                           This was what David's men apprehended. Saul thinks this is a fit opportunity for taking them all prisoners; and he supposes
                           that God was on his side, though, after his repeated crimes, he had little reason to flatter himself with hopes of this nature.

                           He might have pretended that the armament was against the Philistines. (Menochius) --- <I>Ephod.</I> Some say that David put
                           it on. But this was the privilege of the high priest, who gave the answer to David's consultation, which he might perhaps
                           repeat after him. (Calmet) --- He put on the rational to consult God, Exodus xxviii., and Leviticus viii. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           God had only answered the first question before. He now informs David, that it is the intention of the men of Ceila to deliver
                           him into the hands of Saul, who was preparing to attack their city, and that he would inevitably fall into his hands, (Calmet)
                           if he did not retire. (Worthington) --- God sees contingent events with the same certainty as those which will really take
                           place. (Haydock) --- The people of Ceila could not have justly delivered up the innocent David, but they might have insisted
                           that he should quit their city, to save it from destruction; or they might have forced him. (Scholastic) (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 Therefore David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go and smite these

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 Therefore David consulted the Lord again. And he answered and said

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 David, therefore, and his men, went to Ceila, and fought against the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And Saul commanded all the people to go down to fight against Ceila,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Now when David understood that Saul secretly prepared evil against

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And David said: Will the men of Ceila deliver me and my men into the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose, and departing
                                    from Ceila, wandered up and down, uncertain where they should stay: and it was told Saul that David was fled from Ceila, and
                                    had escaped: wherefore he forbore to go out.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 But David abode in the desert in strong holds, and he remained in
                                    a mountain of the desert of Ziph, in a woody hill. And Saul sought him always: but the Lord delivered him not into his hands.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life. And David was

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And Jonathan, the son of Saul, arose, and went to David, into the
                                    wood, and strengthened his hands in God: and he said to him:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Fear not: for the hand of my father, Saul, shall not find thee, and
                                    thou shalt reign over Israel, and I shall be next to thee; yea, and my father knoweth this.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And they two made a covenant before the Lord: and David abode in the
                                    wood: but Jonathan returned to his house.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 *And the Ziphites went up to Saul, in Gabaa, saying: Lo, doth not
                                    David lie hid with us in the strong holds of the wood, in Mount Hachila, which is on the right hand of the desert.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 Now therefore come down, as thy soul hath desired to come down: and
                                    it shall be our business to deliver him into the king's hands.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And Saul said: Blessed be ye of the Lord, for you have pitied my case.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 Go, therefore, I pray you, and use all diligence, and curiously inquire,
                                    and consider the place where his foot is, and who hath seen him there: for he thinketh of me, that I lie craftily in wait
                                    for him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Consider, and see all his lurking holes, wherein he is hid, and return
                                    to me with the certainty of the thing, that I may go with you. And if he should even go down into the earth to hide himself,
                                    I will search him out in all the thousands of Juda.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: and David and his men
                                    were in the desert of Maon, in the plain at the right hand of Jesimon.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 Then Saul and his men went to seek him: and it was told David, and
                                    forthwith he went down to the rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon: and when Saul had heard of it, he pursued after David
                                    in the wilderness of Maon.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And Saul went on this side of the mountain: and David and his men
                                    were on the other side of the mountain: and David despaired of being able to escape from the face of Saul: and Saul and his
                                    men encompassed David and his men round about, to take them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And a messenger came to Saul, saying: Make haste to come, for the
                                    Philistines have poured in themselves upon the land.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 Wherefore Saul returned, leaving the pursuit of David, and went to
                                    meet the Philistines. For this cause, they called that place the rock of division.</font></p>
