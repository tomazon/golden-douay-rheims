                           opportunity. Some think that David ought to have embraced it, and put an end to these troubles, by the death of the usurper.
                           But this was not the opinion of David; and God, who had promised him the throne, had not authorized him to lay violent hands
                           on Saul. He might act on the defensive, but not be the aggressor. (Tirinus) --- <i>Arose,</i> with an intention to kill his
                           unjust persecutor, ver. 11. --- <i>Robe,</i> to convince him how easily he might have taken away his life. (St. Augustine,
                           de C. [City of God?] xii. 6.) --- The noise of Saul's attendants hindered him from being perceived. Perhaps Saul might have
                           put off his robe. (Menochius) --- St. Chrysostom observes, the David obtained more glory by sparing Saul than by killing Goliath.

                                    into a cave, where David hath him in his power.</font></p></i>
                                    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3"></font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">1 Then *David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds of Engaddi.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 And when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, they told
                                    him, saying: Behold, David is in the desert of Engaddi.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 Saul, therefore, took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel,
                                    and went out to seek after David and his men, even upon the most craggy rocks, which are accessible only to wild goats.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 And he came to the sheep-cotes which were in his way. And there was
                                    a cave, into which Saul went, to ease nature: now David and his men lay hid in the inner part of the cave.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And the servants of David said to him: Behold the day, of which the
                                    Lord said to thee: I will deliver thy enemy unto thee, that thou mayst do to him as it shall seem good in thy eyes. Then David
                                    arose, and secretly cut off the hem of Saul's robe.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 After which David's heart struck him, because he had cut off the hem
                                    of Saul's robe.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And he said to his men: The Lord be merciful unto me, that I may do
                                    no such thing to my master, the Lord's anointed, as to lay my hand upon him, because he is the Lord's anointed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And David stopped his men with his words, and suffered them not to
                                    rise against Saul: but Saul, rising up out of the cave, went on his way.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And David also rose up after him: and going out of the cave, cried
                                    after Saul, saying: My lord the king. And Saul looked behind him: and David bowing himself down to the ground, worshipped,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And said to Saul: Why dost thou hear the words of men that say: David
                                    seeketh thy hurt?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 Behold this day thy eyes have seen, that the Lord hath delivered thee
                                    into my hand, in the cave, and I had a thought to kill thee, but my eye hath spared thee. For I said: I will not put out my
                                    hand against my lord, because he is the Lord's anointed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 Moreover, see and know, O my father, the hem of thy robe in my hand,
                                    that when I cut off the hem of thy robe, I would not put out my hand against thee. Reflect, and see, that there is no evil
                                    in my hand, nor iniquity, neither have I sinned against thee: but thou liest in wait for my life, to take it away.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 The Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord revenge me of thee:
                                    but my hand shall not be upon thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 As also it is said in the old proverb: <i>From the wicked shall wickedness
                                    come forth:</i> therefore my hand shall not be upon thee. After whom dost thou come out, O king of Israel?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead dog, after a flea.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 Be the Lord judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and judge
                                    my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, Saul
                                    said: Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And he said to David: Thou art more just than I: for thou hast done
                                    good to me, and I have rewarded thee with evil.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And thou hast shewed this day what good things thou hast done to me:
                                    how the Lord delivered me into thy hand, and thou hast not killed me.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 For who when he hath found his enemy, will let him go well away? But
                                    the Lord reward thee for this good turn, for what thou hast done to me this day.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And now as I know that thou shalt surely be king, and have the kingdom
                                    of Israel in thy hand:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 Swear to me by the Lord, that thou wilt not destroy my seed after
                                    me, nor take away my name from the house of my father.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And David swore to Saul. So Saul went home: and David and his men
                                    went up into safer places.</font></p>
