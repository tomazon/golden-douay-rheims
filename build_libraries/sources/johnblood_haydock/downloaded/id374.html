                           the bed's head.</I> St. Paul, (Hebrews xi. 21,) following the Greek translation of the Septuagint, reads <I>adored the top
                           of his rod.</I> Where note, that the same word in the Hebrew, according to the different pointing of it, signifies both a
                           <I>bed</I> and a <I>rod.</I> And to verify both these sentences, we must understand that Jacob, leaning on Joseph's rod, adored,
                           turning towards the head of his bed: which adoration, inasmuch as it was referred to God, was an absolute, and sovereign worship:
                           but inasmuch as it was referred to the rod of Joseph, as a figure of the sceptre, that is, of the royal dignity of Christ,
                           was only an inferior and relative honour. (Challoner) --- St. Augustine proposes another very probable explanation. He adored
                           God, supporting himself on the top of his staff, or of Joseph's sceptre, q. 162. The Septuagint and Syriac intimate, that
                           Jacob bowed down respectfully towards the sceptre of his son, and thus complied with the explication which he had given to
                           his dream, chap. xxxvii. 10. Others, who understood the Hebrew <I>Hamitta</I>, in the sense given to it by St. Jerome, Aquila,
                           and Symmachus, suppose that after he had given his last instructions to Joseph in a sitting posture, growing weaker, he laid
                           his head again upon his pillow. (Calmet) --- God was pleased to have this recorded in a language subject to such various interpretations;
                           as he, perhaps, would have us to understand, that Jacob literally bowed down both to the bed-head and to the top of the sceptre.
                           For many believe, that the Scripture has often several literal meanings. (Tirinus) --- If the Massoretic points had been known
                           to the Septuagint, we should not have had this variation. But the learned generally agree, that they are of human, and even
                           of very modern invention.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">1 Then Joseph went in and told Pharao, saying: My father and brethren,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 We are come to sojourn in thy land, because there is no grass for the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 The king therefore said to Joseph: Thy father and thy brethren are

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 The land of Egypt is before thee: make them dwell in the best place,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 After this Joseph brought in his father to the king, and presented

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And being asked by him: How many are the days of the years of thy life?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 He answered: The days of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And blessing the king, he went out.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 But Joseph gave a possession to his father and his brethren in Egypt,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 For in the whole world there was want of bread, and a famine had oppressed

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 Out of which he gathered up all the money for the corn which they

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And when the buyers wanted money, all Egypt came to Joseph, saying:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And he answered them: Bring me your cattle, and for them I will give

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And when they had brought them, he gave them food in exchange for
                                    their horses, and sheep, and oxen, and asses: and he maintained them that year for the exchange of their cattle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And they came the second year, and said to him: We will not hide from
                                    our lord, how that our money is spent, and our cattle also are gone: neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left
                                    but our bodies and our lands.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes? we will be thine, both

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, every man selling his possessions,
                                    because of the greatness of the famine. And he brought it into Pharao's hands:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And all its people from one end of the borders of Egypt, even to the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 Except the land of the priests, which had been given them by the king:
                                    to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the public stores, and therefore they were not forced to sell their
                                    possessions.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Then Joseph said to the people : Behold, as you see, both you and
                                    your lands belong to Pharao; take seed and sow the fields,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 That you may have corn. The fifth part you shall give to the king;
                                    the other four you shall have for seed, and for food for your families and children.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And they answered: Our life is in thy hand; only let my lord look
                                    favourably upon us, and we will gladly serve the king.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 From that time unto this day, in the whole land of Egypt, the fifth
                                    part is paid to the kings, and it is become as a law, except the land of the priests, which was free from this covenant.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 So Israel dwelt in Egypt, that is, in the land of Gessen, and possessed
                                    it; and grew, and was multiplied exceedingly.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And he lived in it seventeen years: and all the days of his life came

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 *And when he saw that the day of his death drew nigh, he called his

                                    kindness and truth, not to bury me in Egypt.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 But I will sleep with my fathers, and thou shalt take me away out
