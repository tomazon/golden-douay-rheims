                           His genealogy extends as far as ver. 20, where that of Seir, the Horrite, begins. The seven first verses specify Esau's sons,
                           the twelve next his grandsons born in Seir. From the 15th to the 20th verse, we have the most ancient form of government in
                           that nation under the <I>Aluphim,</I> or heads of families. To them succeed <I>kings,</I> (ver. 31 to 40,) and then <I>dukes</I>
                           to the end. Moses omits several generations of Oolibama's grand-children, as foreign to his purpose, which was to shew the
                           Israelites whom they were not to molest. The <I>kings,</I> of whom he speaks, (ver. 31,) might govern different parts of the
                           country at the same time; and that before any form of government was established among the Hebrews, as it was under Moses,
                           who is styled a king, (Deuteronomy xxxiii. 5,) about 200 years after Esau had driven the Horrites from their mountains. (Calmet)
                           --- Among these nations several good men might exist, as Job, &amp;c. But the true religion was preserved more fully among
                           the 12 tribes. (St. Augustine, City of God xv. xvi.) (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           These wives of Esau are called by other names, chap. xxvi. But it was very common amongst the ancients for the same persons
                           to have two names, as Esau himself was also called Edom. (Challoner) --- <I>Ana the daughter of Sebeon</I>. It is not certain
                           that Ana was a woman. The Samaritan and Septuagint make him son of Sebeon, both here and ver. 14, (Haydock) as well as some
                           Latin copies; and he is mentioned as such, ver. 24. The <I>daughter</I> of Sebeon may, therefore, designate his grand-daughter,
                           which is not unusual. Sebeon is called <I>Hevite, Hethite,</I> and <I>Horrite,</I> on account of his dwelling in different
                           countries; though some think they were different persons. (Calmet) --- This, and innumerable other difficulties, may convince
                           Protestants that the Scriptures are not easy. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           The time of Esau's death cannot be ascertained. There is reason to hope that he died penitent; though in the early part of
                           his life, he gave way to his ferocious temper, and became a figure of the reprobate. He lived on terms of friendship with
