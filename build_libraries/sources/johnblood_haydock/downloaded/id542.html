                           Masius and Salien (Haydock) suppose that Josue selected out of them 30,000; 5000 of whom were to be placed in ambush, and
                           the rest were to pretend that they were terrified at the approach of the king of Hai, and to flee with Josue. But the text
                           seems to assert that all accompanied their general, (Calmet) excepting such as were left to guard the camp. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           There was this difference, that the king of Hai was to be gibbeted, and his corpse stoned, while the city was to be plundered
                           by the Israelites. --- <I>It.</I> This mode of warfare is equally just, as if the enemy was attacked in the open field. <I>Dolus
                           an virtus quis in hoste requirat?</I> (Virgil) --- God was pleased to authorize it on this occasion, that his people might
                           be less exposed, being under some apprehensions on account of the former defeat. Some nations have preferred to encounter
                           the enemy openly. (Grotius, Jur. iii. 1, 20.) But their example is no law for others. "When the war is just, it matters not
                           whether a person gain the victory by open fighting or by stratagem." (St. Augustine, q. 10.) "It is often prudent to conceal
                           the truth." (contra Mend. x.) People engaged in warfare, allow each other to take such advantages. God could easily have routed
                           these few men by means of the army of Israel, or by a miracle, as he did at Jericho. (Haydock) --- But he is at liberty to
                           act as he thinks proper. The ambush was laid on the south-west side of Hai, so that those of Bethel might not perceive it,
                           as they came out to the assistance of their countrymen, ver. 17. Five thousand were placed in one place, and 25,000 in another,
                           while the main body of the army, under Josue, took a circuit by the east, and came to attack the city on the north side. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           The Samaritan Chronicle says, on Mount Garizim. No doubt Josue complied with the injunctions of Moses: but we have seen that
                           there are reasons to doubt which mountain he pitched upon, Deuteronomy xxvii. 4. (Haydock) --- It seems more probable that
                           the altar would be upon Garizim, where the blessings were proclaimed, if the texts of Moses and of Josue did not formally
                           assert the contrary. (Calmet) --- But if they have been interpolated, nothing certain can be deduced from those passages.
                           Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. 8,) says that the altar was between the two mountains, not far from Sichem, which was built at
                           the foot of Garizim; and it is not probable that this historian, the mortal enemy of the Samaritans, would have hesitated
                           to assert that the altar was upon Hebal, if the texts had been so positive, in his time. It is undeniable that the tribes
                           of Levi, and of Ephraim, were upon Garizim; and consequently Josue and the <I>priests</I> must have been there; and who would
                           then officiate at the altar on Hebal? See Kennicott, who ably refutes the insinuations of the infidel, Collins, against the
                           character of the Samaritans. When this altar was erected the learned are not agreed. (Haydock) --- Some say, immediately after
                           the passage of the Jordan, and that the 12 stones taken from the bed of the river, were used for that purpose. Josephus says
                           five years elapsed, and R. Ismael supposes that the altar was not built during the 14 years after the passage of the Jordan.
                           But it is most probable that Josue complied with the command of God as soon as he had procured a sort of peace, (Haydock)
                           by the conquest of these two cities, and was thus enabled to penetrate into the heart of the country, where Garizim was situated,
                           not in the plain of Jericho, as Eusebius imagined, but near Sichem, (Calmet) about 30 or 40 miles to the north-west of Jericho.

                           Spencer complains that the Protestants have not translated <I>barzel,</I> "iron tool," as [in] Deuteronomy xxvii. 5. This
                           translation is found in their more ancient editions of 1537-49, &amp;c. (Kennicott) --- But the difference is very unimportant.
                           The reason of this prohibition is given, Exodus xx. 25. --- <I>He offered;</I> so we read that <I>he wrote, blessed and cursed,</I>
                           &amp;c., because these things were done at least by his authority. It is not necessary to suppose that he engraved the words
                           of the law with his own hands, or that he passed from Garizim, where he had been pronouncing the blessings, to Hebal, in order
                           to denounce the curses. (Haydock) --- He probably commissioned some of the princes on Hebal to perform the office of cursing,
                           after he had repeated the blessings himself from Garizim; and the select company of Levites before the ark, having answered
                           or repeated the words, the whole multitude stationed <FONT size=3>at the foot of each mountain, testified their entire approbation
                           by shouting <I>Amen;</I> the six tribes near Garizim thus ratifying the blessings; and the rest,&nbsp;</FONT>at the foot of
                           Hebal, giving their consent that the transgressors should be cursed. (Kennicott) --- Hence Josue must have sacrificed by the
                           hands of the priests. (Haydock) --- Various instances are produced to shew that princes and prophets have, on extraordinary
                           occasions, performed this office themselves, 1 Kings vi. 15., and vii. 9., and 3 Kings xviii. 32. (Calmet) --- But these must
                           have either received a dispensation from God, or they must have employed the ministry of the legal priests; or, in fine, their
                           actions, like that of Saul, (1 Kings xiii. 9,) of Absalom, (1 Kings i. 9,) Herod, &amp;c., may have been deserving of blame.
                           (Haydock) --- The Jews assert that in the desert no one was permitted to sacrifice, except in the tabernacle; but that this
                           prohibition ceased at Galgal, as the ark had no fixed abode, and thus Josue might offer sacrifice himself. Afterwards the
                           law was enforced, while the ark was at Silo. But upon its being removed to Nobe, Maspha, and Gabaon, people resumed their
                           former liberty; and hence there was nothing to hinder Samuel, Saul, and David from offering sacrifice, till the temple was
                           erected. (Outram de Sac. i. 2; Grotius in Deuteronomy xii. 8.) This sacred office was formerly exercised by kings, particularly
                           at Athens, where, after the people became more numerous, Theseus appointed <I>the king of sacrifices</I> to keep up the memory
                           of the ancient practice. (Demost. c. Neream.) (Calmet) ---&nbsp;The like was done at Rome under the republic. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           of which the altar was formed, (Calmet) or on a separate monument, (Masius) consisting of two stones of black marble, so as
                           to leave the letters prominent, and to fill up the vacuities with white plaster, that they might be seen more plainly, and
                           might, at the same time, be more durable than if they had been only written on the cement, whatever some may have said of
                           the tenacity of the ancient plaster. --- <I>Deuteronomy.</I> &amp;c., or copy of the Decalogue, which, by way of eminence,
                           is called <I>the law,</I> Acts vii. 53. It is distinguished from the blessings and the curses; (ver. 34,) and Moses referred
                           to it, as already existing, (Deuteronomy xxvii. 3, 8,) though the Book of Deuteronomy was not finished till afterwards. He
                           might point to the very tables contained in the ark. "This law, consisting of only 16 verses, might easily be engraved on
                           this solemn day; whereas to engrave the 80 verses of blessings and cursings, would be improbable; and engraving the Pentateuch,
                           or indeed the Book of Deuteronomy, had been impossible." That the Decalogue was to be thus solemnly proclaimed is evident,
                           from the Samaritan text, Exodus xx. 18. (Kennicott) --- This was the covenant which God had made with his people, (Deuteronomy
                           iv. 13,) and which Moses cautions the Israelites to observe; as upon their fidelity, their present and future happiness entirely
                           depended. It was on this title alone that they could hold the land of Chanaan; and therefore Josue takes care thus publicly
                           to admonish them of their duty. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins say that the whole Pentateuch was written on this occasion in 70
                           languages, that no nation might plead ignorance. But we can hardly believe that even the Book of Deuteronomy could be written,
                           and read, and explained to the people, as that would require many days. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           "Gerizim and Ebal, says Maundrell, p. 59, are separated by a narrow valley, not above a furlong broad; and Naplosa, (the ancient
                           Sychem) consisting chiefly of two streets lying parallel, is built at the foot of, and under Gerizim." The princes, representing
                           the different tribes, were stationed on these mountains, and the crowd at the foot of them, while a select company of Levites
                           attended the ark in the midst, and repeated what the princes proclaimed, that the multitude might answer <I>Amen,</I> as they
                           turned successively to them; (Kennicott) or the princes might answer <I>Amen,</I> from the top of the two hills. (Calmet)

                           Coverdale's Bible has "Josua caused it to be proclaimed." "It is very common in Scripture to represent a person as doing that
                           which is done by another, in his name and by his authority." (Kennicott) --- Josue might be in the midst to preside, (Calmet)
                           or rather he would be along with the princes of the six tribes on Mount Garizim, ver. 30. (Haydock) --- Thus the covenant
                           entered into between God and the Israelites, was solemnly ratified when the latter first entered the promised land. The greatest
                           part of those who had been present at Horeb had perished in the wilderness. (Calmet)</FONT></P>
