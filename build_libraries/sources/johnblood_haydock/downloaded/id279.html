                           are three that give testimony in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one:</I> i.e. one in
                           nature, in substance, and in all perfections, in the same sense as when Christ himself said, (John x. 30.) <I>I and the Father
                           are one,</I> or one thing. The Socinians object that this verse is wanting in many Greek manuscripts; and even Erasmus in
                           one edition, and Mr. Simon in his Critics, have questioned it, or rejected it, as a false reading, but without any sufficient
                           proofs and grounds, as hath been shewn by many learned Catholics, and also by Protestant writers, who receive in their translations
                           this verse as canonical. It is easy to account for the omission of this verse; for as both the seventh and eighth verse begin
                           and end with the same words, this gave occasion to the oversight and omission of the transcribers, whereas it is not credible
                           that such a whole verse could be added. And that it was only by the mistake and oversight of transcribers may further appear,
                           because we find part of the seventh verse, to wit, <I>and these three are one,</I> cited by Tertullian, lib. contra Praxeam.
                           chap. xxiii. p. 515. Ed. Rig. and twice by St. Cyprian, Epist. 73. ad Jubaianum. p. 125. Ed. Rig. in the Oxford Edition, p.
                           310. and in his Treatise de Unit. Ecclesiæ, p. 181. Ed. Rigal. and in the Oxford Ed. p. 79, where also Dr. Fell defends this
                           verse of St. John to be genuine. Tertullian and St. Cyprian wrote long before the dispute with the Arians. The Socinians also
                           object that this passage is not brought by St. Athanasius and some other fathers against the Arians, which they could scarce
                           have omitted had they read this verse, but this only proves that this omission had happened in some manuscripts in their time,
                           or, as some conjecture, that the Arians had corrupted some copies. St. Fulgentius made use of it against the Arians, and also
                           others about that time. See the Benedictines of St. Maur against Mr. Simon, in the first tome of St. Jerome, p. 1670. Both
                           Catholics and Protestants, after a&nbsp;diligent examination, have received this verse, which is found in the best manuscripts.
                           See Greek Testament at Amsterdam, in the year 1711.[A.D. 1711.]&nbsp;The three divine Persons, who are present everywhere,
                           though said to be in heaven, gave testimony concerning Christ. The Father by a voice from heaven, both at his baptism (Matthew
                           iii. 17.) and at his transfiguration, (Matthew xvii. 5.) saying: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear
                           ye him:" and also by all the miracles wrought by the same power of all the three divine Persons. 2. The Son testified to the
                           Jews on many occasions, that he was sent from God, that he was the only Son of God, that he and his Father were one, &amp;c.
                           as in the annotations on John iii. The Holy Ghost confirmed the same, particularly by coming down upon the disciples on the
                           day of Pentecost, and inspiring them to teach the same doctrine concerning Jesus Christ. (Witham) --- An express proof of

                           but only of some heinous sins which are very seldom remitted, because such sinners very seldom repent. By a sin therefore
                           which is not unto death, interpreters commonly understand a wilful apostacy from the faith, and from the known truth, when
                           a sinner hardened by his own ingratitude becomes deaf to all admonitions, will do nothing for himself, but runs on to final
                           impenitence. Nor yet does St. John say that such a sin is never remitted, or cannot be remitted, but only has these words,
                           <I>I do not say that any one should ask for</I> the remission of that sin; that is, though we must pray for all sinners whatsoever,
                           yet man cannot pray for such sinners with such a confidence of obtaining always their petitions, as St. John said before,
                           ver. 14. Whatever exposition we follow on this verse, our faith teaches us from the holy Scriptures, that God desires not
                           the death of any sinner, but that he be converted and live. See Ezechiel xxxiii. 11. Though men's "sins be as the scarlet,
                           they shall be made as white as snow." (Isaias i. 18.) It is the will of God that every one come to the knowledge of truth
                           and be saved. See John vi. 40. There is no sin so great but which God is willing to forgive, and has left power in his Church
                           to remit the most enormous sins; so that no sinner need despair of pardon, nor will any sinner perish but by his own fault.
                           (Witham) --- <I>A sin unto death.</I> Some understand this of <I>final impenitence,</I> or of dying in mortal sin, which is
                           the only sin that never can be remitted; but, it is probable, he may also comprise under this name the sin of apostacy from
                           the faith, and some other such henious sins as are seldom and hardly remitted: and therefore he gives little encouragement
                           to such as pray for these sinners, to expect what they ask. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>
