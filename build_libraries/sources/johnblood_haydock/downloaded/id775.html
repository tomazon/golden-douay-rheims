                           Hebrew, &amp;c., so that it is one of the most authentic. Nathan did not give the admonition till about a year had elapsed
                           after the transgression, (2 Kings xii.) when David was made to enter into himself, by a prophet inferior to himself. (Berthier)

                           Babylon, (Abenezra) as a similar addition has been made (Psalm cv. 47., and 1 Paralipomenon xvi. 35.; Calmet) by some inspired
                           author. (Haydock) --- David knew that something more than confession was requisite, and that he must submit to temporal punishments,
                           even though the prophet had assured him that his sin was remitted. He prays to be washed still more from evil habits, ver.

                           --- David was a king, and acknowledged no judge among men. (St. Ambrose, c. x.) --- <i>Soli Deo reus est.</i> (Cassiodorus)
                           --- Urias, whom he had injured, was no more. (St. Augustine) --- The action had been done in <i>secret:</i> (2 Kings xii.
                           12.) but many began to suspect, and to blaspheme. (Haydock) --- <i>Judged.</i> St. Paul reads thus, (Romans iii. 4.) though
                           the Hebrew be, "when thou judgest." St. Jerome has also <i>judicaberis,</i> so that we might infer, that the Hebrew is now
                           incorrect, or that <i>beshophtec</i> means <i>in judicare te.</i> (Berthier) --- Houbigant changes the order of the verses,
                           "cleanse me from my sins, that thou mayst be blameless when thou comest into judgment: For I know," &amp;c. (Haydock) ---
                           Susanna was preserved from sinning by the thought of God's presence, Daniel xiii. 25. --- If David fell, he confessed his
                           fault. (Berthier) --- God is faithful to his promises, and desires the conversion of sinners, though some would represent
                           him as cruel, and unconcerned about his creatures. The psalmist prevents this unjust inference, (Haydock) and proves, that
                           God is both just and merciful. (Worthington) --- He acknowledges his ingratitude, as the captives confess, that their sins
                           have brought on them this chastisement, though they had not injured the Babylonians. (Theodoret) (Flaminius) (Calmet) ---
                           God had often promised pardon to those who truly repent. An appeal is made to his truth and mercy.</font></p><b>

                           and is the fatal root of other transgressions. See St. Augustine, Ench.; St. Thomas Aquinas, i. 2. q. 82. a. 2., <i>est multiplex
                           virtute.</i> (Haydock) --- The prophet speaks here undoubtedly of original sin. (Amama) --- No text could be more express,
                           as the Fathers and the Jews agree. Yet Grotius, whose opinions are almost always singular, and dangerous, maintains, that
                           the expression is hyperbolical, and only implies, that David had been long subject to sin, even from his infancy, as Job was
                           naturally of a merciful disposition, Job xxxi. 18. --- Thus free-thinkers abuse the Scripture, and setting aside all authority,
                           will only see what they think proper. (Calmet) --- The weakness of man is a motive for pity: (Menochius) David pleads for
                           it, yet allows, that the fault was entirely his own, and that he had grace sufficient to have avoided it. (Calmet) --- The
                           consideration of our sinful origin, ought to move us to beg, that we may be washed still more, and that we may not yield to
                           our evil propensities. (Worthington) --- We may resist them, and therefore David would not make vain excuses in sin, as God
                           loves the truth, and a sincere confession. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           have true faith, are more easily converted. But God gives to all some good, which he loves in them, and is ever ready to preserve
                           his gifts, and to save his creatures. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Salvation,</i> or thy salutary joy, (Berthier) "the joy of thy Jesus," (St. Jerome) for whom he prays, (St. Augustine)

                           denote sound reason, (4 Machabees; Philo Nobil) which keeps the passions under, (St. Chrysostom; Job xxx. 15.) or God himself,
                           to whose Spirit all others should be subservient. Rance often inculcated to his Monks, the importance of having this principal
                           spirit, which includes every virtue, particularly of liberality, as the Hebrew <i>nediba,</i> implies. (Berthier) --- "Thy
                           free Spirit." (Protestants) --- How earnestly should we endeavour to be disentangled from all the chains of our passions!
                           (Haydock) --- David might also fear, lest he had forfeited the throne, like Saul, whom the Spirit left, 1 Kings x. 9., and
                           xvi. 14. Kings affected to be styled liberal, Luke xxiii. 25. (Calmet) --- He repeats his petition thrice, in allusion to
                           the three persons in one God, (St. Augustine, &amp;c.) and prays, that the Messias may still spring from him, notwithstanding
                           his sins, and that he may have a constant and willing spirit to fall no more. (Worthington) --- Principal, or liberal, may
                           refer to the Holy Ghost, the fountain of all grace, or to the king, who ought to be generous. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           This is a sort of satisfaction. (Menochius) --- While engaged in sin, David could not well exhort his subjects to repentance.
                           His example was rather an inducement for them to transgress. (Berthier)--- But when they saw his grief, and knew that God

                           internal, before outward sacrifices. This of the heart must precede those of justice, and of praise. (Worthington) --- The

                                    <p>19 A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: a contrite and humbled heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</p>

                                    <p>21 Then shalt thou accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt-offerings: then shall they lay calves upon
