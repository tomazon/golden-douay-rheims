                           women,</I> who had been brought up in the service of idols, and were not sincerely converted. (Haydock) --- Riches engaged
                           Solomon in the love of pleasure, and this brought on his ruin. (Calmet) --- He began with the spirit, but ended in the flesh,
                           Galatians iii. 3., and Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 21. He was aware of the dangerous conversation of women, Ecclesiasticus xix.
                           2. Yet he has left us in his own person an example of that dreadful truth, that it is difficult to love with discretion. (Haydock)
                           --- <I>Amare et sapere vix cuiquam conceditur.</I> Nothing could be more beautiful than the commencement of his reign, nor
                           more terrible than the latter part of it. <I>Thou hast stained thy glory,</I> &amp;c., Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 22. Hence we
                           may apply to him, <I>How are thou fallen from heaven?</I> (Isaias xiv. 12.) (Calmet) --- <I>Pharao.</I> This marriage seems
                           to be blamed, as the source of Solomon's misfortunes; though it is probable, that she had pretended to embrace his religion.
                           (Menochius) (Salien) --- He ought to have repudiated her as soon as she relapsed. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           See Exodus xxxiv. 16., and Deuteronomy vii. 4. The law only forbids expressly the marrying of the women of Chanaan. But it
                           was easy to discern, that the spirit of the law equally prohibited connexions with others who were addicted to idol-worship.
                           See 1 Esdras x. 3. Such alliances are always dangerous, and generally prove fatal; (Calmet) unless there be good reason to
                           believe that the parties are sincerely converted: in which case the prohibition ceases. (Haydock) --- <I>Love.</I> Thus, <I>nitimur

                           or secondary wives. (Haydock) --- Those who have any sense of modesty, can hardly read this without blushing. (Salien) ---
                           Solomon was guilty not only of intemperance, but also of a transgression of the precept. (Menochius) (Deuteronomy xvii. 17.)
                           --- <I>He shall not have many wives:</I> though as that command is indefinite, and David had eighteen, without blame, (2 Kings
                           iii. 3.) it is difficult to say how many a person might have, at that time, without exceeding the bounds of moderation. (Haydock)
                           --- But a thousand wives for one man, is certainly too great a number. When Solomon wrote the Canticles, he had only sixty
                           queens and eighty concubines, Canticle of Canticles vi. 8. The Rabbins allow the king eighteen wives. But it is probable that
                           most of the kings indulged themselves in a greater latitude. Darius, of Persia, took along with him to the wars 350 concubines,
                           when he was overcome by Alexander. (Atheneus xiii. 1.) Priam had also many wives, besides Hecuba, the <I>queen.</I> The inferior
                           wives looked upon those who had this title with a degree of respect, bordering on adoration. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           about fifty. (Salien) (Calmet) --- This is an aggravation of his guilt. (Haydock) --- Solomon spent the first thirty years
                           of his reign in virtue: but towards the termination of it, he gave into idolatry, and into such excesses, that he deserves
                           to be ranked with Henry VIII, who began well, but ended with dishonour. (Haydock) --- <I>Heart,</I> and <I>mind</I> also,
                           ver. 9. He sacrificed to idols, not only externally, but gave them internal worship; (Salien) so much was his understanding
                           darkened, unless (Haydock) he acted against his better knowledge, Ecclesiastes ii. 9. (Tirinus) --- <I>Father</I> who did
                           not continue long in sin. (Du Hamel) --- "The wisdom, which had been given to him, entirely abandoned his heart, which the
                           discipline even of the smallest tribulation had not guarded." (St. Gregory, Pastoral. p. 3.) --- "He had commenced his reign
                           with an ardent desire of wisdom, and when he had obtained it by spiritual love, he lost it by carnal affections." (St. Augustine,
                           Doct. iii. 21.) --- "Prosperity, which is a severe trial for the wise, was more disadvantageous to him than wisdom herself
                           had been profitable." (St. Augustine, City of God xvii. 20.) --- The Fathers do not attempt to palliate the guilt of Solomon;
                           and those aggravate his crime, who endeavour to excuse him by saying, that his mind was still convinced that there could be
                           but one God, and that his adoration of idols was merely external, and out of complaisance to his wives. See Santius,&amp;c.

                           The Jews were more prone to those of Chanaan. We find, however, that they were addicted to the worship of Adonis, who was
                           highly revered in Egypt; (Ezechiel viii. 14.; Calmet) and the golden calves were an imitation of Apis. (Haydock) --- Six temples

                           (Menochius) besides sending a prophet to him while he was building, chap. vi. 12. (Abulensis) --- God was not content with

                           so that his transgression is more horrible and ungrateful. (Calmet) --- No doubt the priests and prophets had often besought

                           after the captivities of Assyria and Babylon, went by the common title of Jews. (Tirinus) --- The Levites, and many of the
                           Israelites, came to inhabit in the land of Juda, for the sake of the true religion, chap. xii. 17., and 2 Paralipomenon xi.
                           13, 16. Jeroboam banished the tribe of Levi from his dominions, that he might more easily introduce a change of religion among
                           his subjects. The two kingdoms were thus almost equal in strength. (Calmet) --- <I>Chosen</I> for the abode of holiness, and

                           St. Chrysostom, at different times, seems to have entertained opposite opinions on this head, (Haydock) which has been a matter
                           of controversy among the Fathers, as it is at present with us. We ought to adore and imitate, with trembling, the silence

                           forward, to embrace discipline." (Haydock) --- But the Hebrew, Chaldean, and Vulgate have nothing similar. (Calmet) --- Some
                           think that the Book of Proverbs, as well as that of Ecclesiastes, was composed by him after his repentance; and that he expresses
                           his sentiments of affliction and self-condemnation, (Proverbs xxx. 2.) and his opinion of all earthly gratifications, Ecclesiastes
                           i. 2., &amp;c. (Haydock) --- Yet this dreadful uncertainty may serve to keep us all in humble fear, and teach us to work out
                           our salvation with trembling. (Calmet) --- If Solomon really repented, (Haydock) he might not have time or power to remove
                           all the vestiges, and the very foundations of the idolatrous temples, which Ezechias also neglected in ruins, as no longer
                           dangerous, and as so many monuments of the folly of Solomon. But Josias caused them to be entirely removed, 4 Kings xxiii.

                           Sadoc seems to have departed this life about the same time with Solomon; as his son Achimaas, who had married Basemath, the
