                           xxv. 1.) being associated in the empire by his aged father Nabopolassar, <I>came up</I> to attack Carchemis, (Jeremias xlvi.
                           1.) and the other dominions of Egypt, (ver. 7.) and their ally or vassal <I>Joakim.</I> He took the city of Jerusalem, and

                           was gone with haste to secure all the dominions of his deceased father. In the 7th year of his reign, he sent <I>rovers</I>
                           to punish Joakim. When the latter had reigned near 11 years, they reduced the kingdom, and treated the king's corpse with

                           had <I>wives</I> so soon, ver. 15. (Calmet) --- Some attempt to reconcile both places, by saying that the eight years refer
                           to the commencement of his father's reign; (Junius) which is very unusual: (Calmet) or to the servitude of Babylon, when Jerusalem
