                           which St. Paul had not time to do; for example, <I>to establish priests</I>[5] in the cities, that is to say, bishops, as
                           the same are called bishops in ver. 7; and, as St. Chrysostom and others observe, it is evident from this very place, that
                           the word <I>presbyter</I> was then used to signify either priests or bishops. If St. Jerome here meant that bishops were only
                           placed over priests by ecclesiastical and not by divine institution, as some have expounded his words, his singular opinion
                           against so many others is not to be followed. (Witham) --- That the ordaining of priests belongs only to bishops, is evident
                           from the Acts and from St. Paul's epistles to Timothy and Titus. It is true, St. Jerome seems to express himself as if in
                           the primitive Church there was no great difference between priests and bishops, yet he constantly excepts giving holy orders,
                           (ep. 85) as also confirming the baptized, by giving them the Holy Ghost by imposition of hands and holy chrism; (dial. contra
                           Lucif. chap. iv.) which pre-eminence he attributes to bishops only. To assert that there is no distinction between a priest
                           and bishop is an old heresy, condemned as such by the Church. See St. Epiphanius, hær. 75.; St Augustine, hær 53.</FONT></P><B>

                           seem to have all the force St. Paul meant them to have. For it is not sufficient that a bishop be free from great crimes;
                           he ought, moreover to lead such a life as to draw others by his example to the practice of virtue. (Calmet) --- If we consult
                           all antiquity we shall find, that if in the early infancy of the Church some who had been once married were ordained to the
