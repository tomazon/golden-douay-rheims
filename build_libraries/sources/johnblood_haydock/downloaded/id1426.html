                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">1 It *came to pass also, that seven brethren, together with their mother,
                                    were apprehended, and compelled by the king to eat swine's flesh against the law, for which end they were tormented with whips
                                    and scourges.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 But one of them, who was the eldest, said thus: What wouldst thou ask,
                                    or learn of us? we are ready to die, rather than to transgress the laws of God, received from our fathers.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 Then the king being angry, commanded frying-pans, and brazen cauldrons
                                    to be made hot: which forthwith being heated,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 He commanded to cut out the tongue of him that had spoken first: and
                                    the skin of his head being drawn off, to chop off also the extremities of his hands and feet, the rest of his brethren and
                                    his mother looking on.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And when he was now maimed in all parts, he commanded him, being yet
                                    alive, to be brought to the fire, and to be fried in the frying-pan: and while he was suffering therein long torments, the
                                    rest, together with the mother, exhorted one another to die manfully,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 Saying: The Lord God will look upon the truth, and will take pleasure
                                    in us, *as Moses declared in the profession of the canticle; And in his servants he will take pleasure.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 So when the first was dead after this manner, they brought the next
                                    to make him a mocking-stock: and when they had pulled off the skin of his head with the hair, they asked him if he would eat,
                                    before he were punished throughout the whole body in every limb.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 But he answered in his own language, and said: I will not do it. Wherefore
                                    he also, in the next place, received the torments of the first:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And when he was at the last gasp, he said thus: Thou indeed, O most
                                    wicked man, destroyest us out of this present life: but the King of the world will raise us up, who die for his laws, in the
                                    resurrection of eternal life.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 After him the third was made a mocking-stock, and when he was required,
                                    he quickly put forth his tongue, and courageously stretched out his hands:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And said with confidence: These I have from heaven, but for the laws
                                    of God I now despise them, because I hope to receive them again from him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 So that the king, and they that were with him, wondered at the young
                                    man's courage, because he esteemed the torments as nothing.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And after he was thus dead, they tormented the fourth in the like
                                    manner.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And when he was now ready to die, he spoke thus: It is better, being
                                    put to death by men, to look for hope from God, to be raised up again by him; for, as to thee, thou shalt have no resurrection
                                    unto life.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And when they had brought the fifth, they tormented him. But he, looking
                                    upon the king,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 Said: Whereas thou hast power among men, though thou art corruptible,
                                    thou dost what thou wilt: but think not that our nation is forsaken by God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 But stay patiently a while, and thou shalt see his great power, in
                                    what manner he will torment thee and thy seed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 After him they brought the sixth, and he being ready to die, spoke
                                    thus: Be not deceived without cause: for we suffer these things for ourselves, having sinned against our God, and things worthy
                                    of admiration are done to us:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 But do not think that thou shalt escape unpunished, for that thou
                                    attempted to fight against God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 Now the mother was to be admired above measure, and worthy to be remembered
                                    by good men, who beheld seven sons slain in the space of one day, and bore it with a good courage, for the hope that she had
                                    in God:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And she bravely exhorted every one of them in her own language, being
                                    filled with wisdom; and joining a man's heart to a woman's thought,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 She said to them: I know not how you were formed in my womb; for I
                                    neither gave you breath, nor soul, nor life, neither did I frame the limbs of every one of you.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 But the Creator of the world, that formed the nativity of man, and
                                    that found out the origin of all, he will restore to you again, in his mercy, both breath and life, as now you despise yourselves
                                    for the sake of his laws.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 Now Antiochus, thinking himself despised, and withal despising the
                                    voice of the upbraider, when the youngest was yet alive, did not only exhort him by words, but also assured him with an oath,
                                    that he would make him a rich and a happy man, and, if he would turn from the laws of his fathers, would take him for a friend,
                                    and furnish him with things necessary.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 But when the young man was not moved with these things, the king called
                                    the mother, and counselled her to deal with the young man to save his life.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And when he had exhorted her with many words, she promised that she
                                    would counsel her son.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 So bending herself towards him, mocking the cruel tyrant, she said
                                    in her own language: My son, have pity upon me, that bore thee nine months in my womb, and gave thee suck three years, and
                                    nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 I beseech <i>thee</i>, my son, look upon heaven and earth, and all
                                    that is in them, and consider that God made them out of nothing, and mankind also:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 So thou shalt not fear this tormentor, but being made a worthy partner
                                    with thy brethren, receive death, that in that mercy I may receive thee again with thy brethren.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 While she was yet speaking these words, the young man said: For whom
                                    do you stay? I will not obey the commandment of the king, but the commandment of the law which was given us by Moses.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 But thou that hast been the author of all mischief against the Hebrews,
                                    shalt not escape the hand of God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 For we suffer thus for our sins.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And though the Lord, our God, is angry with us a little while, for
                                    our chastisement and correction, yet he will be reconciled again to his servants.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 But thou, O wicked, and of all men most flagitious, be not lifted
                                    up without cause with vain hopes, whilst thou art raging against his servants.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of the Almighty God, who
                                    beholdeth all things.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 For my brethren having now undergone a short pain, are under the covenant
                                    of eternal life: but thou, by the judgment of God, shalt receive just punishment for thy pride.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 But I, like my brethren, offer up my life and my body for the laws
                                    of our fathers: calling upon God to be speedily merciful to our nation, and that thou by torments and stripes mayst confess
                                    that he alone is God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 But in me, and in my brethren, the wrath of the Almighty, which hath
                                    justly been brought upon all our nation, shall cease.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 Then the king being incensed with anger, raged against him more cruelly
                                    than all the rest, taking it grievously that he was mocked.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 So this man also died undefiled, wholly trusting in the Lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 And last of all, after the sons, the mother also was consumed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 But now there is enough said of the sacrifices, and of the excessive
