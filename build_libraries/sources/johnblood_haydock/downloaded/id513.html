                           Hence it appears that the doctrine of the Quakers, who condemn all wars, is contrary to that of <EM>God</EM>. If they were

                           Eleazar, the high priest, acted in this capacity in the war against Madian, and sounded the trumpet, as it was not beneath
                           his dignity. Many priests always attended the army, (Calmet) the <I>captain</I> of whom (Haydock) first made the declarations
                           (ver. 5, 6, 7,) to the whole army; and these were repeated by the inferior priests at the head of each company, when the army
                           was set in array. So were also the promises of protection, (ver. 3, 4,) when all were ready for battle. The Rabbins assert,
                           that the option was granted only in those wars which were undertaken without the express command of God, and that officers
                           were placed in the rear with hatchets or scythes, to cut the legs of those who attempted to flee. (Grotius; &amp;c.) --- But
                           this seems to be an invention of their own, and Moses makes no distinction between voluntary wars and those of precept. These
                           regulations were, no doubt, observed, though the sacred historians do not mention the particulars. (Calmet) See 1 Machabees

                           the army. But this does not seem to have been generally the case. (Calmet) --- <I>Of you.</I> "We must co-operate, being assisted"

                           or only heralds, does not appear. (Calmet) --- They were probably the priests attached to the army, ver. 2. See chap. i. 15.

                           seems to have been intended for such a solemnity. At the dedication of the walls of Jerusalem, great rejoicings were made,
                           2 Esdras xii. 27. Josephus and the Rabbins allow a whole year for the occupation of the house, before the builder or new owner,
                           could be obliged to go to war, in like manner as that term is specified for a person who had lately married a wife, chap.
                           xxiv.5. The ancient Greeks deemed it a great misfortune to leave a house unfinished and a new wife desolate, which was the

                           sacred to the Lord, and given to the priests, so that the owner could not partake of the fruit till the fifth year, when it
                           ceased to be in a manner sacred. Jonathan translates, "and has not redeemed it," by paying the first-fruits of the fifth year.
                           Septuagint, "has not rejoiced in it," by feasting, as was probably the custom at the first vintage. Other fruit-trees entitled
                           the owner to the like privilege. (Schikard., Jus. reg. 5.) --- <I>Whereof all may eat,</I> is added by the Vulgate to explain

                           if she proved unfaithful, she was punished like an adulteress, chap. xxii. 23, &amp;c.) and she could not be given till she
                           was 12 years old. If she were 13 complete, when she was asked in marriage, she was only obliged to wait 30 days. (Selden,
                           Uxor. ii. 1.) (Chap. xxv. 5.) Philo allows this immunity from war, only to those who had espoused a virgin. They were also
                           freed from paying taxes, mending roads, &amp;c., chap. xxix. 5. (Calmet) --- Those who are entangled with worldly cares, are
                           apt to discourage the valiant, and to dissuade fighting, for fear of losing these advantages: much more are those in danger

                           Interpreters are not agreed whether this law was general, and included the nations whom God had ordered the Hebrews to exterminate,
                           or not. They were nothing but the executioners of his decree. They were commanded not to marry any of their daughters, but
                           to put all to fire and sword, Exodus xxxiv. 15, 16. The cities which were not assigned to them for a possession, were to be
                           treated in a different manner; (ver. 15,) and hence the Gabaonites, being convinced that they were comprised in the number
                           of the devoted cities, pretended that they came from a great distance. Josue (ix. 4, 7,) and the heads of the people, acknowledge
                           that they could not make a league with those nations whose lands they were to possess. Yet the Gemarra of Jerusalem asserts,
                           that Josue proposed to the Chanaanites, "flight, peace, or war." The Gergesites hereupon fled into Africa, the Gabaonites
                           accepted peace, and 31 kings declared for war. (Selden, Jur. vi. 13.) --- Maimonides and Grotius (Jur. ii. 13,) maintain,
                           that no war can be lawful, unless an offer of peace be made. The latter undertakes to prove, that the commands respecting
                           the Chanaanites were conditional, and presupposed that they would not yield to the terms which were offered. Hence Rahab was
                           saved, the league with the Gabaonites was kept, even after it was known who they really were. Solomon, who conquered some
                           of the surviving Chanaanites, did not think himself bound to destroy them, 3 Kings ix. 2., and 2 Paralipomenon viii. 7. The
                           reason why they seem to be consigned to death without pity, is because God foresaw their evil disposition, as Josue (xi. 20,)
                           insinuates, and the Israelites under his eye gave quarter to some Chanaanites. "War, says St. Augustine, (ep. 189. ad Bonif.)
                           is waged only that peace may be obtained." But these arguments do not seem so convincing, as to take away the opposition which
                           God has established between these devoted nations and others, ver. 15. What he commands cannot be unjust, and the army only
                           executes his sentence. (St. Augustine in Jos. q. 10.) Grotius allows that he foresaw the obstinacy of the Chanaanites, so
                           that it would have been useless to offer them any terms; and in effect, we find no vestiges of any being offered in the books
                           of Moses or of Josue. (Calmet) --- Yet see chap. xxi. 10. (Haydock) --- The Israelites might have many reasons for going to
                           war either with their brethren, or with foreign nations, as to punish a heinous crime, a rebellion, &amp;c. (see Judges xx.,
                           2 Kings x. 4, and xx. 15,) on which occasions they were bound to offer terms. (Calmet) --- "A wise man ought to try every
                           expedient before he takes up arms." (Terence.)</FONT></P><B>
