                           <i>Elias</i> means, "the strong God." Some Greeks derive the name of the prophet from <i><u>elios</u>,</i> "the sun," improperly.
                           His parentage is not known, nor even his tribe. Thesbe was situated in the tribe of Gad. The Fathers agree that Elias never
                           was married. He seems to have had no fixed abode; but was sent to the house of Israel, to maintain the cause of the true God,
                           with the most active and generous zeal. He may have presided over the colleges of the prophets, (Calmet) which were then numerous
                           in Israel, particularly at Mount Carmel, (Tirinus) notwithstanding the general corruption, chap. xviii. 13., and xix. 10.
                           (Haydock) --- <i>I stand,</i> to serve (Numbers iii. 6.) and pray, James v. 17., and Luke iv. 25. He calls God to witness,
                           like St. Paul, Galatians i. 20. --- <i>Mouth.</i> Stupendous power and assurance of the prophet, with which the pagans have
                           nothing to compare. (Calmet) --- God had threatened his people with drought, if they proved faithless, Deuteronomy xxviii.
                           24. Elias begs that this punishment may now serve to open their eyes. (Tirinus)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Ravens.</i> Hebrew <i>horebim,</i> (Haydock) is sometimes rendered "Arabs," by the Vulgate, 2 Paralipomenon xxi. 16. Others
                           would translate, "merchants," or the inhabitants of Arabo, which was near Carith. They suppose that the ravens, being unclean
                           birds, would never have been employed. But they were only forbidden to be eaten or touched, when dead; and God is not restricted
                           by his own laws. He might thus chose to display his wonderful providence. St. Jerome relates how St. Paul, the first hermit,
                           was fed thus by a raven, with half a loaf a day; and a whole one was sent, when St. Anthony went to see him. (Calmet) ---
                           Yet Kennicott mentions this as one of the improvements which might be now made in the Protestant version, "the Orbim," or
                           inhabitants of Oreb, or Orbo. <i>Orbim, accolæ villæ in finibus Arabum Eliæ dederunt alimenta.</i> (Jerom iii. 119.) --- It
                           is not clear to what passage he refers. (Diss. ii. p. 581.) Another instance occurs, Judges xv. 4., where instead of foxes,
                           he would substitute "300 sheaves of corn, placed end to end." But if there were no mistranslations of great importance, the
                           version might subsist. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           (Theodoret, q. 52.) --- It is idle to inquire whence the ravens took this food. (Calmet) --- Some say from the kitchen of
                           Achab. (Abulensis) --- The minister of angels undoubtedly intervened. (Tirinus) --- God provides his servant with what may
                           support nature, without any wine or delicacies. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           12. She was not an Israelite, (Luke iv. 25.) but probably a pagan. (St. Chrysostom, &amp;c.) --- Many suppose that Elias did
                           not know, at first, that she was to entertain him. (Calmet) --- But both the one and the other might be divinely instructed
                           how to act. In due time the widow and the prophet became acquainted with the will of God, and complied with it. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           her guest drew down blessings upon her. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           Dial. ii. 32.) This posture represented the condescension of Jesus Christ in assuming our nature, to give us life; and the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And she said to Elias: What have I to do with thee, thou man of God?
