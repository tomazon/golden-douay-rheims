                           <i>Harlot.</i> Hebrew <i>Zona,</i> Josue ii. 1. It is uncertain whether she was properly a concubine, or a wife of inferior
                           dignity. She lived with her son in the house of Galaad; (Calmet) at least the latter was in his father's house. (Haydock)
                           --- Hence Jephte complains that he had been expelled, not that he was debarred from enjoying his father's inheritance, and
                           consequently the law was not observed in his regard. Moses makes no provision for illegitimate children, but he excludes the
                           son of a <i>mamzer from the church of God,</i> Deuteronomy xxiii. 2. Some think that the mother of Jephte was of a nation
                           with whom it was not lawful to marry. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] v. 9.) <i>Said.</i> (Grotius) --- Seratius believes that his
                           father was already married, when he had to do with this harlot. (Menochius) --- But he might have first taken her to wife,
                           without the usual formalities. (Drusius; Cornelius a Lapide) --- It is equally uncertain whether Jephte was of the tribe of
                           Gad or of Manasses, as both occupied the country of Galaad. Interpreters generally conclude that he was of one of these tribes,
                           and most probably of the latter; his father also was called <i>Galaad.</i> (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           imagined that Jephte was at the head of some banditti. (St. Augustine, q. 43.) --- But David's followers were of the same
                           description (1 Kings xxii. 2,) as those of Jephte, men of determined resolution and valour. (Calmet) --- Such a man as Jephte,
                           was therefore a valuable acquisition to the dispirited Israelites; and Providence had inured him to labour, and endued him
                           with extraordinary prudence, notwithstanding his want of education, ver. 12. Necessity has often supplied every deficiency,
                           and produced the most consummate generals. <i>Prince.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "and there were gathered unto Jephte vain

                           of Ammon laid claim to all the country, and had many of the Moabites in his army, Jephte answers at once, that the land under
                           dispute belonged to neither of these nations. (Calmet) --- They had entirely lost it when Israel attacked Sehon, and took
                           it from him, as was plain from the history of Moses and of the Amorrhites, Numbers xxi. 27. (Haydock) --- Jephte refers to

                           <i>His land,</i> which the Amorrhite had first conquered, and which God took from him to give to Israel. It was clear that
                           this country was not then considered as the property of the sons of Lot, since God expressly forbad his people to molest them.
                           (Haydock) --- Jephte produces the right of conquest, the grant of God, and the possession of 300 years, to prove that the
                           country belonged to the Israelites. All acknowledge that the right of conquest, in a just war, give a good title. (Grotius,
                           Jur. iii. 6, 7.) --- The children of Lot had lost all hopes of recovering what Sehon had taken from them. (Calmet) --- He
                           could not be proved to be a thief or an usurper, but was in peaceable possession when the war with Israel commenced, in which
                           he lost all his dominions. (Haydock) --- By the same right, David kept what he had taken from the Amalecite plunderers, (1
                           Kings xxx. 20,) and Abraham might have retained the spoils which had been carried off from Sodom, Genesis xiv. 21. The Roman
                           and Grecian histories are full of such examples; and this right was admitted by all as the law of nations, <i>Quæ ex hostibus,
                           jure gentium, statim capientium fiunt.</i> (Caius. J. C.) --- The second argument of Jepthe is unanswerable, since God may
                           undoubtedly transfer the property of one to another. But as the Ammonites might reply that they did not admit the God of Israel,
                           he observes that the latter might at least have the same privilege as their Chamos, ver. 24. Prescription of so long a time,
                           with good faith, was the third argument, as the Amorrhites being destroyed, and the Moabites disheartened, could not pretend
                           to reclaim the conquered country. There would never be an end of disputes among men, if the undisturbed possession of a country
                           for such a length of time did not confirm their right to it. These principles establish the tranquillity of families and of
                           states. (Calmet; Grotius, Jur. ii. 4.)</font></p><b>

                           have 25 years too many; (Haydock) whereas "those who adduce the title of prescription, are accustomed rather to increase than

                           <i>Whosoever,</i> &amp;c. Some are of opinion, that the meaning of this vow of Jephte, was to consecrate to God whatsoever
                           should first meet him, according to the condition of the thing; so as to offer it up as a holocaust, if it were such a thing
                           as might be so offered by the law; or to devote it otherwise to God, if it were not such as the law allowed to be offered
                           in sacrifice. And therefore they think the daughter of Jephte was not slain by her father, but only consecrated to perpetual
                           virginity. But the common opinion followed by the generality of the holy fathers and divines is, that she was offered as a
                           holocaust, in consequence of her father's vow: and that Jephte did not sin, at least not mortally, neither in making nor in
                           keeping his vow; since he is no ways blamed for it in scripture; and was even inspired by God himself to make the vow, (as
                           appears from ver. 29, 30.) in consequence of which he obtained the victory; and therefore he reasonably concluded that God,
                           who is the master of life and death, was pleased, on this occasion, to dispense with his own law; and that it was the divine
                           will he should fulfil his vow. (Challoner) --- St. Thomas [Aquinas] (2. 2. q. 88. a. 2.) acknowledges that Jephte was inspired
                           to make a vow, and his devotion herein is praised by the apostle, Hebrews xi. 32. But he afterwards followed his own spirit,
                           in delivering himself, without mature deliberation, and in executing what he had so ill engaged himself to perform. This decision
                           seems to be the most agreeable to the Scripture, and to the holy fathers. St. Jerome (in Jer. vii.) says, <i>non sacrificium
                           placet, sed animus offerentis.</i> "If Jephte offered his virgin daughter, it was not the sacrifice, but the good will of
                           the offerer which deserves applause." Almost all the ancients seem to agree that the virgin was really burnt to death; and
                           the versions have <i>whosoever,</i> which intimates that Jephte intended to offer a human victim; particularly as he could
                           not expect a beast fit for such a purpose, would come out of the doors of his house to meet him. (Calmet) --- Yet many of
                           the moderns, considering how much such things are forbidden by God, cannot persuade themselves that Jephte should be so ignorant
                           of the law, or that the priests and people of Israel should suffer him to transgress it. The original may be rendered as well,
                           "whatsoever proceedeth....shall surely be the Lord's, and (Protestants) or I will offer it up for a holocaust." (Pagnin. &amp;c.)
                           --- The version of Houbigant is very favourable to this opinion. See Hook's Principia. --- It is supposed that the sacrifice
                           of Iphigenia, which took place about this time, (Aulis. v. 26,) was only in imitation of this of Jephte's daughter. But the
                           poets say, that Diana saved her life, and substituted a doe in her place; (Ovid, Met. xii.) which, if true, would make the
                           conformity more striking, if we admit that the sacrifice of Jephte's daughter was not carried into effect. Iphigenia was made
                           a priestess of Diana, to whom human victims were immolated. The daughter of Jephte, whom the false Philo calls Seila, was
                           consecrated to the Lord, and shut up (Haydock) to lead a kind of monastic life; as the wives of David, (2 Kings xx. 3.; Grotius)
                           after they had been dishonoured, were obliged to live in a state of continency. Although (Haydock) forced chastity be not
                           a virtue, (Calmet) yet Jephte had no reason to believe that his daughter would not enter into the spirit of his vow, and embrace
                           that state for God's honour and service. We know that she gave her entire consent to whatever might be the nature of his vow;
                           and surely she would be as ready to refrain from marriage, however desirable at that time, as to be burnt alive, which would
                           effectually prevent her from becoming a mother, ver. 37. To require this of her, was not, at least, more cruel in her father
                           than to offer her in sacrifice. The Chaldean paraphrast says, "Jephte did not consult Phinees, the priest, or he might have
                           redeemed her;" and Kimchi gives us a very mean idea, both of Jephte and of the high priest, the great Phinees, whom the Rabbins
                           foolishly suppose was still living, and of course above 300 years old, ver. 26. --- "Phinees said, <i>He wants me, let him
                           come to me.</i> But Jephte, the head of the princes of Israel, <i>shall I go to him?</i> During this contest the girl perished."
                           To such straits are those reduced who wish to account for the neglect of Jephte in redeeming his daughter, as the Targum observes,
                           was lawful for a sum of money, Leviticus xxvii. 2, 3, 28. --- But (Haydock) his vow was of the nature of the <i>cherom,</i>
                           which allowed of no redemption, and required death. (Calmet) --- On this point, however, interpreters are not agreed, and
                           this manner of devoting to death, probably, regarded only the enemies of God, or such things as were under a person's absolute
                           dominion. (Haydock) --- If a dog had first come out to meet Jephte, could he have offered it up for a holocaust? Certainly
                           not, (Grotius) because it was prohibited, (Deuteronomy xxiii. 18,) to offer even its <i>price,</i> (Haydock) and only oxen,
                           sheep, goats, turtles and doves, were the proper victims. If, therefore, a person made a vow, of a <i>man,</i> he was to be
                           consecrated to the Lord, (Grotius) like Samuel, and he might marry. But a woman could not, as she was already declared the
                           servant of the Lord, and was not at liberty to follow her husband. (Amama) --- We need not herein labour to defend the conduct
                           of Jephte. The Scripture does not canonize him on this account. If he did wrong, his repentance, and other heroic acts of
                           virtue, might justly entitle him to be ranked among the saints of the old law. (St. Augustine, q. 49) --- "Shew me the man
                           who has not fallen into sin....Jephte returned victorious from the enemy, but in the midst of his triumph, he was overcome
                           by his own vow, so that he thought it proper to requite the piety of his daughter, who came out to meet him, by parricide.
                           In the first place, what need was there of making a vow so hastily, to promise things uncertain, the event of which he knew
                           not, instead of what was certain? Then why did he perform so sorrowful a vow to the Lord God, by shedding blood?" (St. Ambrose,
                           Apol. Dav. i. 4.) --- This saint adopts the common opinion that Jephte really immolated his daughter. But he is far from thinking
                           that he was influenced by the holy spirit to make the vow, otherwise he would never represent it in such odious colours. If
                           God had required the life of Jephte's daughter, as he did formerly command Abraham to sacrifice his son, the obedience and
                           faith of the former would have been equally applauded, as the good will of the latter. But most of those who embrace the opinion
                           that Jephte sacrificed his daughter, are forced to excuse or to condemn the action. They suppose that he was permitted to
                           fulfil his vow, that others might be deterred from making similar promises, without the divine authority. (St. Chrysostom,
                           hom. xiv. ad pop. Ant.; St. Jerome, contra Jov. i.) "I shall never, says St. Ambrose (Off. iii. 12,) be induced to believe
                           that Jephte, the prince, did not promise incautiously that he would immolate <i>whatever</i> should meet him,...since he repented
                           of his vow," &amp;c. &nbsp;We may observe that this great Doctor supposes, that Jepthe promised to sacrifice the first thing
                           that should meet him&nbsp;"at the door of his own house;" whence he seems to take <i>whosoever</i> in the same latitude as
                           we have given in the Hebrew. He concludes, "I cannot accuse the man who was obliged to fulfil his vow," &amp;c. We may imitate
                           his moderation, (Haydock) rather than adopt the bold language of one who has written notes on the Protestant Bible, (1603)
                           who says, without scruple, that by this rash vow and <i>wicked performance, his victory was defaced;</i> and again, that he
                           was overcome with <i>blind zeal,</i> not considering whether the vow was lawful or not. (Worthington). --- If Jephte was under
                           the immediate influence of the Holy Ghost in what he did, as Salien believes, and the context by no means disproves, we ought
                           to admire the faith of this victorious judge, though he gave way to the feelings of human nature, ver. 35. We should praise
                           his fidelity either in sacrificing or in consecrating his daughter to God's service in perpetual virginity: but if he followed
                           his own spirit, we cannot think that he was so ill-informed or so barbarous as to murder his daughter, nor that she would
                           consent to an impiety which so often disgraced the pagan superstition, though she might very well agree to embrace that <i>better
                           part,</i> which her father and God himself, by a glorious victory, seemed to have marked out for her. Amid the variety of
                           opinions which have divided the learned on this subject, infidels can derive no advantage or solid proof against the divine
                           authority of the Scripture, and of our holy religion. The fact is simply recorded. People are at liberty to form what judgment
                           of it they think most rational. If they decide that Jepthe was guilty of an oversight, or of a downright impiety, it will
                           in the first place be difficult for them to prove it to the general satisfaction; and when they have done so, they will only
                           evince that he was once a sinner, and under this idea the word of God gives him no praise. But if he did wrong in promising,
                           as many of the Fathers believe, he might be justified in fulfilling his vow, as God might intimate to him both interiorly,
                           and by granting him the victory, that he dispensed with his own law, and required this sort of victim in order to foreshew
                           the bloody sacrifice of Jesus Christ for our sins, (Serarius and Salien, in the year of the world 2850) or the state of virginity
                           which his blessed Mother and so many nuns and others in the Christian Church embrace with fervour. --- <i>Peace,</i> with
                           victory. --- <i>Same.</i> Hebrew, "it shall be the Lord's, and (or) I will make it ascend a whole burnt-offering." (Haydock)
                           --- The particle <i>ve</i> often signifies <i>or</i> as well as <i>and,</i> and it is explained in this sense here by the
                           two Kimchis, by Junius, &amp;c. See Exodus xxi. 17. Piscator says, the first part of the sentence determines that whatever
                           the thing was it should be consecrated to the Lord, with the privilege of being redeemed, (Leviticus xxvii. 11,) and the second
                           shews that it should be immolated, if it were a suitable victim. (Amama)</font></p><b>

                           Pythagorean friends, one of whom, being sentenced to die, procured the other to stand bond for his return; and, at the time
                           appointed, came freely to deliver himself up; an instance of generosity which made the tyrant who had sentenced him to die,
                           beg that they would admit him into the society of their friendship. (Haydock) --- Whatever we may think of Jephte, "we cannot
                           sufficiently admire the dutiful behaviour, and amiable simplicity of the daughter, who voluntarily submitted to her parent's
                           will, and exhorted him to do as he had vowed. To die to sin, to resign the pomps of a licentious world, to renounce those
                           pleasures and incentives to vice, which are inconsistent with a clean heart, is a sacrifice truly meritorious, and acceptable
                           to God; it is a sacrifice which was solemnly begun at the font of baptism." (Reeves, in the year of the world 2817.) --- <i>No

                           contrary opinion. No mention of death is made. The virgin only deplores, with pious resignation, that she cannot be the happy
                           mother of the Messias.</font></p><b>

                           "to talk with," or "to comfort the daughter of Jephte" as he supposes that the custom subsisted during her life, while she
                           was shut up either near the tabernacle, or in her father's house. (Calmet) --- Montanus renders "to speak to." Junius and
                           the Tigurin version, "to discourse with." --- <i>Thanan</i> certainly is used for "he related," &amp;c. Judges v. 11., <i>yethannu
                           narrentur,</i> or rather <i>narrent;</i> and the construction here seems to require this sense. (Amama) --- If this be admitted,
                           the bloody sacrifice is at an end, since the daughters of Israel could not meet to comfort the virgin every year, if she was
                           immolated at the expiration of two months. But if we follow the translation of the Vulgate, Septuagint, and Chaldean, as the
                           Protestants have done, the lamentation might still be viewed in the same light, as tending to condole with the lady, rather
                           than bewail her untimely death, (Haydock) as, for the latter purpose, it would not have been necessary for them to assemble
                           together. (Amama) --- They might well enter into her sentiments, when she <i>mourned her virginity,</i> (ver. 38,) and strive
                           to yield her some comfort in her secluded state, by coming in such numbers, and with the permission of the priests of God,
                           continuing with her <i>four days.</i> (Haydock) --- Some translate "to publish," or sound forth the praises (Calmet) of this
                           heroic virgin, which may be true, whether she was slain, or only consecrated to the Lord. (Haydock) --- St. Epiphanius (hær.
                           55., and 78,) informs us that "at Sichem an annual sacrifice was still offered up in the name of the virgin, and that she
                           was revered as a goddess by the people in the vicinity." The vow of Jephte seems to have given rise to what we read in profane
                           authors, of that which Idomeneus, king of Crete, made in the midst of a storm at sea: "He vowed that he would sacrifice to
                           the gods whatever met him first. It happened that his son was the person, whom, when he had immolated, or, as others say,
                           had wished to do it, and afterwards a pestilence had ensued, his subjects drove him from his kingdom." (Servius in Æneid iii.,
                           and xi.) (Calmet) --- Aldrovandus (in Asino) relates a similar vow of Alexander the Great. Even the more sober pagans could
                           not, it seems, approve of the unwarranted vows of parents to destroy the lives of their children. But of people consecrated
                           to the Lord, by their parents, without first requiring their consent, we have many examples, in Samuel. (St. Bonaventure,
                           July 14, &amp;c.) --- If we explain the vow of Jephte in the same sense, every difficulty will be removed, and infidels will
                           not allege this example to prove that human victims are pleasing to God. (Haydock)</font></p></blockquote><font size="2" face="Arial"></font><b><font
