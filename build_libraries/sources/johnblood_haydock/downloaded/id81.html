                           design and end of this parable is to shew that, rigorously speaking, we are useless servants with regard to God. This sovereign
                           Master has a right to exact of us every kind of service, and to make us apply ourselves to any task he may think proper, without
                           our having any reason to complain either of the difficulty, trouble, or length of our labours; we are entirely his, and he
                           is master of our persons, time, and talents. We hold of him whatever we possess, and woe to us if we abuse his trust, by applying
                           our talents to any use contrary to his designs. But though he be Lord and Master, he leaves our liberty entire. If he produces
                           in us holy desires, if he works in us meritorious actions, gives us virtuous inclinations and supernatural gifts, he sets
                           to our account the good use we make of them; and in crowning our merits, he crowns his own gifts. (St. Augustine, lib. ix.

                           a value to our good works, which, in consequence of his promise, entitles them to an eternal reward. (Challoner) --- The word
                           <I>useless,</I> when joined to servant, generally means a servant from whom his master does not derive the service he has
                           a right to expect; as in St. Matthew xxv. 30. Here the word is taken in a less odious sense. It means a servant who does not
                           testify sufficient zeal and ardour in his master's service, who is not very eager to please him. With regard to God, we are
                           always useless servants, because he wants not our services; and without his assistance, we can neither undertake nor finish
                           any thing to please him. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           oblige them by that to acknowledge him for their Messias; 2ndly, that the lepers might enjoy the fruit of their cure, by returning
                           to the society of their fellow men, after they had been declared clean, and satisfied all the demands of the law; for there
                           were may ceremonies previous to be gone through. (Calmet) --- And lastly, to shew that in the new law, such as are defiled
                           with the leprosy of sin, should apply to the priests. Hence, says St. Augustine, let no one despise God's ordinance, saying

                           that it, so as to be observed; not with great marks of temporal power, as you imagine. (Witham) --- The Pharisees expected
                           a Messias powerful according to this world, a conqueror, a monarch, a revenger of the injuries of Israel; one who would restore
                           them to liberty, and bless them with temporal goods and prosperity. In Jesus, they saw nothing, which corresponded to these
                           magnificent hopes; and therefore asked him, by way of insult and reproach, when this kingdom of God would come, which he so
                           often talked of and announced to his disciples. He answers them, that the manifestation of the Messias, and the establishment
                           of his kingdom, shall not be effected in a conspicuous, splendid manner. It shall be brought about insensibly, and the accomplishment
                           of the designs of the omnipotence of our Lord shall appear a casualty, and the effect of secondary causes. You shall not see
                           the Messias coming at the head of armies, to spread terror and desolation. His arrival shall not be announced by ambassadors,
                           &amp;c. every thing in the establishment of my kingdom shall be the reverse of temporal power. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           and they shall be exposed to persecution and affliction: then they shall wish to see one day of the Son of man, and shall

                           the question of his disciples in the preceding verse, our blessed Saviour only returns this enigmatical answer, which seems
                           to mean, that where-ever there are guilty Jews, there shall their enemies pursue them and find them out, not only in Jerusalem,
                           but in all the cities of Judea, Galilee, &amp;c. every where the vengeance of the Lord shall follow them, and overtake them.

                           between the precise words of our Lord, as given by St. Matthew and St. Luke, as in St. Matthew chap. xxiv. ver. 40, and in
                           Luke xvii. 34, and alibi passim [elsewhere in various places], we can reconcile those apparent variations, by supposing that
