                           and considered as fabulous. But besides a particular judgment at the hour of death, the Hebrews believed in a general judgment

                           &amp;c. The Jews, at the time of our Saviour, were free from idolatry, to which their ancestors had been so prone for so long
                           a time. But to this evil had succeeded another, scarcely less heinous, viz. sacrilege, and a profanation of holy things. The
                           greater part of the high priests bought their office. The priests permitted in the temple itself a kind of traffic, which
                           caused our Saviour to declare to them, that they had made the house of his Father a den of thieves. And to favour their own
                           avarice, they taught that it was lawful to defraud their creditors, and refuse to their parents the necessary succour, in
                           the case of vows to give to the temple. St. Paul does not here reproach them for the profanations of the temple which they
                           committed in the last siege of Jerusalem, for it had not then taken place; but he knew full will the dispositions of their
                           hearts, and the little regard they had for the most sacred things. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           apostle here only repeats the reproaches which the prophets had repeated so often before, that the Jews, by the contrast between

                           of the Gentile world. (Calmet) --- A reproach this, which also bears very heavy upon many Christians of the present day; who
                           by their profession believe the truth of the one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic faith, and by their conduct belie the same,
