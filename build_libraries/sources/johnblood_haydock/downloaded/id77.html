                           blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.</I> These seem to have been some of the seditious followers of Judas, the
                           Galilean, or <I>Gaulonite,</I> who denied that God's people were to pay taxes; and it is thought that some of them, coming
                           to offer up sacrifices in the temple, Pilate caused them to be slain at that very time, so that their blood was mixed with
                           the sacrifices. (Witham) --- <I>Whose blood,</I> &amp;c. i.e. whom he had caused to be massacred in the temple, at the time
                           they were offering sacrifices. The history, to which allusion is made in this place, is not well known; but there is great
                           probability that these Galileans were disciples of Judas, the Galilean, who taught that they ought not to pay tribute to foreigners.
                           As they were spreading this doctrine in Jerusalem, and perhaps even in the temple, Pilate laid violent hands upon them, and
                           caused them to be murdered amidst the sacrifices. (Calmet) --- <I>Galileans,</I> &amp;c. These were the followers of one Judas,
                           a Galilean, of whom St. Luke makes mention in the Acts of the Apostles, (Chap. v.) who held it unlawful to call any one <I>lord.</I>
                           Many of this sect were punished by Pilate, because they would not allow this title to be given to CÃ¦sar; they also maintained
                           that no other sacrifices could lawfully be offered, except such as were prescribed by the law, by which opinion they forbade
                           the accustomed sacrifices offered up for the emperor and people of Rome. Pilate, irritated by these their opinions, ordered
                           them to be slain in the midst of their sacrifices, and this was their blood mixed with that of the victims. (St. Cyril in
                           St. Thomas Aquinas)</FONT></P><B>

                           &amp;c. People are naturally inclined to believe, that those who are unfortunate, and afflicted with calamities, must likewise
                           be culpable and impious. The Jews were very much given to these sentiments, as we see in many places of Scripture; John ix.
                           2 and 3. Our Saviour wishes to do away with this prejudice, by telling them that the Galileans, who are here spoken of, were
                           not the most culpable among the inhabitants of that country; shewing by this, that God often spares the most wicked, and sends
                           upon the good the most apparent signs of vengeance, that he may exercise the patience, and crown the merit of the latter,
                           and give to the former an example of the severity which they must expect, if they continue in their disorders. Neither can
                           it be said, that in this God commits any injustice. He uses his absolute dominion over his creatures, when he afflicts the
                           just; he procures them real good, when he strikes them; and his indulgence towards the wicked, is generally an effect of his
                           mercy, which waits for their repentance, or sometimes the consequences of his great anger, when he abandons them to the hardness
                           of their reprobate hearts, and says, "I will rest, and be angry with you no longer." (Ezechiel, Chap. xvi. 42.) This is the
                           most terrible mark of his final fury. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           prediction of our Saviour upon the impenitent was afterwards completely verified; for Josephus informs us, that under the
                           government of Cumanus, 20,000 of them were destroyed about the temple. (Jewish Antiquities, lib. xx, chap. 4.) That upon the

                           blood quite round the temple.</I> (The Jewish War, lib. iv, chap. 7.) That in consequence of the threefold faction that happened
                           in Jerusalem before the siege of the Romans, the temple was <I>every where polluted with slaughter;</I> the priests were slain
                           in the exercise of their functions; many who came <I>to worship, fell before their sacrifices; the dead bodies of strangers
                           and natives were promiscuously heaped together, and the altar defiled with their blood.</I> (The Jewish War, lib. vi, chap.
                           1.) That upon the Romans taking possession of the city and temple, <I>mountains of dead bodies were piled up about the altar;
                           streams of blood ran down the steps of the temple;</I> several were destroyed by the <I>fall of towers,</I> and others suffocated
                           in the ruins of the galleries over the porches. (The Jewish War, lib. vii, chap. 10.)</FONT></P><B>

                           is rather surprising that Christ should make use of these opprobrious words, which could be of no service to himself, but
                           which would only serve to irritate king Herod, should they come to his ears. But Christ, by these words, probably wished to
                           shew that he was not the least afraid of him whom the Pharisees feigned to have a design on his life: for it is supposed that
                           the Pharisees had invented this fiction, in order to compel him to leave them quiet. (Maldonatus)</FONT></P><B>
