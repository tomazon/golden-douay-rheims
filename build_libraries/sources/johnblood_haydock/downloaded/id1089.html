                           <i>Then.</i> Septuagint, "After Eliu had ceased to speak." (Haydock) --- <i>Lord.</i> That is, an angel speaking in the name
                           of the Lord. (Challoner) --- The name Jehova (Haydock) here occurs, though it never does in the speeches; whence many have
                           inferred that the Lord spoke in person; which argument, however, is not conclusive; and that this work was written after the
                           apparition in the burning bush. (Calmet) --- The Hebrew edition would at least be given after that event. --- <i>Whirlwind,</i>
                           designed to strike the senses, (Haydock) and to represent the distressed condition of Job. (Pineda) --- This awful appearance
                           imposed silence upon all. (Haydock) --- Some think that a time was allowed for reflection and repentance, before God passed
                           sentence; but the Septuagint, &amp;c., seem to suppose that the cause was decided as soon as Eliu had ended his discourse.
                           (Calmet) --- God discusses the controversy, and gives sentence in favour of Job. (Worthington)</font></p><b>
                           </b><p><b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">Ver. 2.</font></b><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">
                           <i>Words.</i> Many explain this as a condemnation (Calmet) of the last speaker, (Du Hamel) who would otherwise pass without
                           any reproach, (Haydock) though he had spoken with less reserve than the rest. (Calmet) --- Pineda allows that this opinion
                           is very plausible; but he thinks that Job himself is reprehended, not for any grievous offence, but for indiscreet expressions,
                           chap. xli. The context also seems to require this, as Job takes it to himself, chap. xxxix. 33. (Calmet) --- The change of
                           persons might rather imply the contrary: <i>Who is this?</i> Eliu. <b>3.</b> <i>Gird up thy loins.</i> Job. (Haydock) ---
                           Can we admit that the devil got the victory; or, that God falsely declared that Job had spoken <i>right?</i> chap. xlii. (Houbigant)
                           --- Did not the latter maintain the truth with greatest zeal, while his friends certainly <i>mixed unskilful</i> words or
                           inferences with <i>sentences</i> of the greatest consequence? <i>His face I will accept, that </i>your<i> folly be not imputed
                           to you; for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath,</i> chap. xlii. 8. Hebrew, "Who is this that
                           darkeneth counsel, by words without knowledge?" (Protestants) "Who is the who concealeth counsel from me, keeping words in
                           his heart, and thinketh to hide from me?" (Septuagint) Eliu pretended to explain the counsels of God, and perhaps did not
                           utter all that he had in his mind; but God condemns the very harbouring of thoughts, which are contrary to truth and justice.
                           (Haydock) --- Job's friends laboured under great prejudices, and condemned him without cause, (Calmet) thinking that they
                           were doing a service to God, like those who put the apostles to death, and persecuted Catholics on account of their religion.
                           But this plea will not excuse them. Here one line suffices to refute the long harangue (Haydock) of Eliu; (St. Gregory; Ven.
                           Bede; Tirinus, &amp;c.) though we have observed, (Haydock) some understand the words to be addressed to Job, as a rebuke for
                           his too warm expressions. (St. Chrysostom; St. Augustine, &amp;c.) (Calmet) --- The remainder of the discourse is designed
                           for Job's instruction. (Haydock) --- <i>Hoc</i> (Eliu)<i> despecto ad erudiendum Job verba vertuntur.</i> (St. Gregory)</font></p><i></i><b>

                           (Haydock) --- <i>Answer</i> my reasons, if thou art able. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "make me know." (Haydock) --- Only the Creator
