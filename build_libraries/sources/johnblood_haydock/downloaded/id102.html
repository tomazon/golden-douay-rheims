                           might fall into darkness. The Jews were thus condemned, on account of their presumption and hardness of heart, and grace was
                           granted to the Gentiles to enter into the true Church. These are the designs of the Almighty upon mankind, some of whom remain
                           in infidelity, whilst others receive the light of faith; but all is done by the secret and impenetrable decrees of the justice

                           --- If you had humility enough to acknowledge your blindness and ignorance, and seriously to seek for a remedy, you would
                           soon be delivered from sin, and freed from the evil of blindness. But filled as you are with presumption, you remain still
                           in blindness, which, as it is voluntary, is at the same time criminal and inexcusable. This is your evil; this your sin. (Calmet)
                           --- We here see that it is judged by truth itself far better not to read the Scriptures at all, than to read them with bad
                           dispositions; not to see the miracles of Jesus Christ, than to refuse our assent to their author. At the present day all read
                           the Scriptures, but do we see any marked improvement in the moral world? The text, without any comment, is given to Churchmen
                           and to Dissenters: the latter gladly accept the offering, because, as the Rev. Frederick Noland observes, (in his objections
                           of a Churchman to uniting with the Bible society, p. 34) "the authorized version is in many places accommodated to their peculiar
                           opinions, through the conciliatory spirit of the Church, which revised the text for the purpose of doing their objections
                           away." And in his note on this part, he adds: "The last revisal of the translation of the Bible was undertaken, as is notorious,
                           for the purpose of removing certain objections made to the old version by the non-conformists. That the execution has been
                           answerable to the intent, is evident from the fact of the Dissenters having withdrawn their exceptions, and adopted the version.
                           Comp. Nichols. Defens. Eccles. Anglic. p. 33. Pierre. Vindic. Fratr. Dissent. p. 60-67." Thus (Acts xiv. 23.) "<I><U>cheirotonesantes
                           de autois presbuterous kat ekklesian</U>.</I> When <I>they had ordained them elders by election,</I> in every church. (Bp's
                           Bible.) When they had <I>ordained them elders</I> in every church. (Authors. vers.) These words, as applied to St. Paul and
                           St. Barnabas, who had merely received first orders, (Acts xiii. 2.) form in the former version an argument against presbyters'
                           right to ordain, and in the latter one in favour of that practice." As a further accommodation, he says the word <I>elders</I>
                           was substituted for <I>presbyters,</I> &amp;c. "Independency in the very nature of it is schism; for every <I>congregation</I>
                           is a different <I>church.</I>" (Sherl. Def. of Stillingfl.)</FONT></P>

                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">10 They said, therefore, to him: How were thy eyes opened?</p>

                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">13 They bring him that had been blind, to the Pharisees.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">14 Now it was the Sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">15 Again, therefore, the Pharisees asked him how he had received his
                                    sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">16 Some, therefore, of the Pharisees said; This man is not of God, who
                                    keepeth not the sabbath. But others said; How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among
                                    them.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">17 They say, therefore, to the blind man again; What sayest thou of him
                                    that hath opened thy eyes? And he said; He is a prophet.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">18 The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind
                                    and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight:</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">19 And asked them, saying; Is this your son, who you say was born blind?
                                    How then doth he now see?</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">20 His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son,
                                    and that he was born blind:</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">21 But how he now seeth, we know not: or who hath opened his eyes, we
                                    know not: ask himself; he is of age; let him speak for himself.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">22 These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the
                                    Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">23 Therefore did his parents say; He is of age; ask himself.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">24 They, therefore, called the man again that had been blind, and said
                                    to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">25 He said then to them; If he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know,
                                    that whereas I was blind, now I see.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">26 Then they said to him; What did he to thee? how did he open thy eyes?</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">27 He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard: why
                                    would you hear it again? will you also become his disciples?</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">28 They reviled him, therefore, and said; Be thou his disciple: but we
                                    are the disciples of Moses.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">29 We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from
                                    whence he is.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">30 The man answered, and said to them; Why herein is a wonderful thing,
                                    that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes:</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">31 Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a worshipper
                                    of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">32 From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man

                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">33 Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">34 They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins, and
                                    dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him,
                                    he said to him; Dost thou believe in the Son of God?</p>
                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">36 He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?</p>

                                    <p align="left" style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">38 And he said; I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.</p>
