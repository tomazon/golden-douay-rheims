                           &amp;c. Hebrew, "thou must not hide thyself," so as to pass it by, nor yet conceal it from the right owner. When a thing is
                           certainly abandoned by him, it belongs to the person who seizes it first; but if it be only lost, it must surely be restored,
                           if possible, (Grotius, Jur. ii. 10,) as nature forbids us to take advantage of another's misfortune. (Cicero) --- The Rabbins
                           have corrupted this law, like so many others, by their evil interpretations. They pretend that a Jew must restore what he
                           has found belonging to another true believer, if it have certain marks by which it may be known, but not if it belonged to
                           a prevaricator or infidel. In the former supposition, they got the thing cried on a high stone near Jerusalem four times,
                           and if the owner did not then claim his property, the finder might keep it. (Selden, Jur. vi. 4.) --- The inhabitants of Cumæ
                           condemned the next neighbour to restore what had been lost; as Hesiod (op. 348,) very well remarks, that things would not
                           easily be lost, if the neighbours were not ill-disposed.</FONT></P><B>

                           Some take this literally, as the contrary practice is contrary to decency, and might be attended with very pernicious consequences.
                           All know what noise was occasioned by the action of Clodius, who put on women's apparel, that he might be present with the
                           Roman ladies at the feast of the good goddess. Yet others think that Moses here forbids some superstitious practice. St. Ambrose
                           (ep. 69,) remarks, that in some of the mysteries of the idols, it was requisite for those present to change clothes in this
                           manner, <I>sacrum putatur.</I> Lucian testifies, that men put on women's clothes at the feasts of Bacchus. They did the like
                           in those of Venus, while the women took men's clothes in the festivals of Mars. (Jul. Hirmic. c. 4.) (Maimonides) --- In the
                           East, people honoured the moon, to which they attributed both sexes, and Venus in like manner. Josephus ([Antiquities,?] iv.
                           8,) believes that women are here prohibited to engage in warfare. Hebrew, "the vessels (armour) of man shall not be upon a
                           woman." Semiramis gained a great name by her martial exploits, and commanded all her subjects to dress like herself. (Justin.,
                           i) --- The Amazons were likewise very famous in war, and it is said that half the army of Bacchus was composed of women. Alb.
                           Gentil maintains that Moses here condemns an abominable crime, which he did not wish to mention, at which the Book of Wisdom
                           hints, (chap. xiv. 26,) and which St. Paul condemns more explicitly, Romans i. 26. Moses had already denounced death against
                           the perpetrators of it; and surely the manner in which he now speaks, seems to forbid something more than simply putting on
                           the garments of the other sex, <I>for he,</I> &amp;c. (Calmet) --- Yet that disorderly conduct deserved to be reprobated in
                           strong terms, (Haydock) when it was not excused by some necessity or proper motive, such as actuated some holy virgins, St.
                           Theodora, &amp;c. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           to train them up to a horror of cruelty; and to the exercise of humanity, and mutual charity one to another. (Challoner) ---
                           Some were of opinion that the person who could take the old bird on the nest, might assure himself of good fortune, fecundity,
                           &amp;c. (St. Thomas Aquinas, i. 2, q. 102, a. 6.) Such superstition is reprehensible. Phocilides advises not to take all the
                           young ones, nor the hen, in consideration of one's having more birds. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Those who refrain from cruelty, even towards beasts, will be induced more easily to shew mercy to their fellow creatures,

                           This precaution was necessary, because all their houses had flat tops; and it was usual to walk and to converse together upon
                           them. (Challoner) --- King Ochozias had the misfortune to fall from the top of his house, (4 Kings i. 2,) and David saw Bethsabee
                           when he was walking on the roof of his palace, 2 Kings xi. 2. Saul slept at the top of Samuel's house, 1 Kings ix. 25. See

                           If wheat was sown in a vineyard, it would ripen much sooner than the grapes; and as the first-fruits of both were offered
                           to the Lord, the owner would lose the profit which he had too greedily sought after, the place being esteemed both pure and
                           impure at the same time. This mixture of seeds would also impoverish the land, so that it would be like a place <I>defiled,</I>
                           and unfit for cultivation. (Jansenius in Leviticus xix. 19.) Maimonides supposes that the practice of the Zabians is here
                           reprobated. They sowed the land with corn and dry grapes, in honour of Ceres and Bacchus, (More. Nev. p. 3. c. 37,) who presided
                           over the harvest and vintage among the pagans. (Wm. of Paris. Leg. 13.) --- Moses might also, by this symbolical language,
                           condemn unnatural connexions, as he perhaps does, ver. 10.</FONT></P><B>

                           In Leviticus xix. 19, this law is expressed, so as to forbid the procreation of mongrels. See Judges xiv. 18. People who have
                           treated on agriculture observe, that it is a pernicious practice to make animals of unequal size and speed work together.
                           (Colum. vi. 2.) --- St. Paul explains to us the mystical sense of this passage. <I>Bear not the yoke together with infidels,</I>
                           2 Corinthians vi. 14. (Calmet) --- Marry not with such. (Haydock) --- Employ not in the sacred ministry the imprudent and

                           This is now lawful. But a virgin consecrated to God, must not dress like a married woman: the different states of life must

                           Hebrew, "and occasion reports against her to bring an evil name upon her," (Haydock) that he may not have to return her dowry.
                           For, according to many of the Rabbins, he might give her a bill of divorce, simply if he did not like her. (Selden, Uxor.
                           iii. 1, &amp;c.) --- They allow the proof here specified, only with respect to a Hebrew woman between twelve and twelve and
                           a half years old, during the period of her being espoused, but not taken home by her husband. The cause was to be tried before
                           the 23 judges. Oftentimes only witnesses, probably matrons, were examined in defence of the woman. (Josephus, [Antiquities?]
                           iv. 8.) St. Ambrose (ep. 8. 64. ad Syagr.) highly disapproves of such unsatisfactory methods. The marks assigned by the law
                           were commonly observed in Syria, Persia, &amp;c. The Arab physicians speak of them. See Valesius, c. xxv. The age in which
                           women were then married, the climate, &amp;c., caused these indications to be more clear, and deposed for or against the fidelity
                           of the bride. The mother had them entrusted to her care by the friends of the husband, who had kept watch at the door on the
                           wedding night. (M.[Menochius;?] Nachman, ap. Fagium.)</FONT></P><B>

                           It was concluded that she had committed the sin after her espousal. If it had happened before, she was to receive only 25
                           sicles for a dowry; though, if she took an oath that violence had been offered to her, she was entitled to 50: which opinion
                           of the Rabbins seems very equitable. Æschines (in Timarch.) relates, that a man at Athens punished the transgression of which
                           his daughter had been guilty, while she was at home, by shutting her up with a horse, in order that she might be torn in pieces

                           or the woman refused their consent to the marriage, the person had only to pay 50 sicles; which the woman received, if her
                           father was not alive. But if they consented, the person who had been condemned by the judge, was bound to marry the woman,
