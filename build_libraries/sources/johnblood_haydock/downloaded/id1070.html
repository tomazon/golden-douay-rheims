                           <i>Ten times;</i> very often. --- <i>Oppress me.</i> Hebrew word occurs no where else, and is variously translated. It may
                           signify, "to dig a pit for me," chap vi. 27., and Psalm vi. 6. Job repeats nearly what he had said before, only with greater
                           vehemence. He admits that Providence treats him in an unusual manner. Yet he still retains an assured hope, and arraigns his
                           adversaries before the divine tribunal. (Calmet) --- Yet he rather hesitates; (ver. 4, 6.) and this species of ignorance is
                           the folly of which he, at last, accuses himself, chap. xlii. 3. It was no real fault, chap. xlii. 8. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>With an equal judgment.</i> St. Gregory explains these words thus: Job being a just man, and truly considering his own
                           life, thought that his affliction was greater than his sins deserved; and in that respect, that the punishment was not equal,
                           yet it was just, as coming from God, who gives a <i>crown of justice</i> to those who suffer for righteousness' sake, and
                           proves the just with tribulations, as gold is tried by fire. (Challoner) --- He knew that God would surely give a just reward,
                           2 Timothy iv. (St. Gregory xiv. 16.) (Worthington) --- The friends of Job had too contracted a notion of Providence, supposing
                           that the virtuous could not be afflicted. Job allowed that the ordinary rules were not here observed. Hebrew, "the Lord hath
                           perverted <i>or</i> overthrown me." (Calmet) --- This gave him no small uneasiness. If the thing had been as plain as it appears
                           now to us, he might have refuted all with a bare denial. (Houbigant)</font></p><b>

                           plundering one another's territories, without any declaration of war. Mercury and Autolychus are praised for thefts of this

                           and subjoins, "with a writing instrument of iron and (or) lead, or be engraven on the rocks for a memorial." Grabe insinuates
                           that before there was only, "and on lead, or be engraven on the rocks." (Haydock) --- <i>Instrument, </i>(<i>celte</i>) means
                           "a chisel," (Haydock) like <i>c&#339;lum</i> from <i>c&#339;lo:</i> " I engrave." (Pineda) --- St. Jerome, (ad Pam.) and the
                           late editor of his works, retain this word, as the older editions of St. Gregory did; (Calmet) though <i>certe,</i> "surely,"
                           has been inserted instead, from several manuscripts by the Benedictines. (Haydock) --- Ancient manuscripts and Latin Bibles
                           have more generally the latter word. But the received editions are supported by many manuscripts (Calmet) and the Septuagint
                           <i><u>eggluthenai</u>,</i> expresses as much. <i>Celtis est, <u>gluthaion</u>.</i> (Amama). (Casaub. in Athen. vii. 20. p.
                           556.) --- An inscription, in Dalmatia, has the same sense: <i>Neque hic atramentum vel papyrus aut membrana ulla adhuc; sed
                           malleolo et celte literatus silex.</i> "Here as yet was neither ink, nor paper, nor any parchments; but a flint stone was
                           lettered with a mallet and a chisel.." The former modes of writing were not, in effect, invented in the days of Job. (Calmet)
                           --- But it was long very usual to make use of lead. (Pineda) --- What he desired to have written in such durable characters,
                           (Haydock) was the following sentence, in proof of his unshaken confidence in God, and as a refutation of his friends, who
                           accused him of despair and blasphemy, (Calmet) as also the whole history of his conflict. His desire has been granted. (Tirinus)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Redeemer</i> may be understood of the Deity, without confining it to the second Person; (Isaias xli. 14., and xlix. 7.;
                           Piscator) though it may have a more peculiar reference to Christ: (Junius; Haydock) in whom he believed, as the Redeemer of
                           all mankind. (Calmet) --- <i>Earth.</i> Yea, ere long I shall be restored to health, (St. Chrysostom; Grotius) as an earnest
                           and figure of the resurrection. Nothing is more common, in Scripture, than for the same prophecy to have a double accomplishment;
                           one soon after it is made public, and another more sublime and remote. Job seemed to have no expectation of surviving his
                           present misery, (ver. 7., and chap. vii. 7., and xxiv. 15.) unless God now revealed it to him, as a figure of his future resurrection,
                           founded on the hope of our Saviour's, which he expresses in much clearer terms. Hebrew, "I know that my Redeemer is living,
                           and that he will raise himself one day upon the earth," (Calmet) like a conqueror, (Haydock) or wrestler, having overthrown
                           his antagonist: (Amama) or, "he will stand the last upon the earth, <i>or</i> dust," (Piscator) ascending his throne, to judge
                           all. (Deodat.) --- Yet Luther translates, "and one day he will raise me up from the earth;" which is not conformable to the
                           Hebrew. Others explain, "he....will place (<b>26</b>) this, my skin, after they (worms) shall have ruined it." (Pagnin; Montanus)
                           --- But Amama suspects that the latter is not in earnest. Pineda defends the Vulgate and observes that <i>yakum</i> (Haydock)
                           may signify, "will raise" himself, or "me;" the latter being at least a consequence of the former, if St. Jerome did not read

                           that he is eternal, who will set me free," (Haydock) by death, (Calmet; or redemption; <i><u>ekluein</u></i>) "upon the earth."</font></p><b>

                           of his corporeal eyes, (Haydock) and to be restored to favour, so that God would no longer turn his back on him, chap. xlii.
                           5. St. Gregory, when legate at Constantinople, convinced the patriarch Eutychius, by this text, that after the resurrection,
                           our bodies would still be palpable, and not aerial only. (Calmet) --- It contains an express profession of Job's faith, on
                           this head. We shall rise the same in substance. (Worthington)</font></p><b>
