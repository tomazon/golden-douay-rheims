                           second journey to Jerusalem was as follows. Some brethren coming from Judea to Antioch, there maintained the necessity of
                           circumcision and the other Mosaic rites, asserting that without them salvation could not be obtained. St. Paul, upon his return
                           to Antioch, strongly defended, in conjunction with Barnabas, the liberty of the gospel. As the contest grew warm, it was resolved
                           to depute Paul and Barnabas to consult the other apostles and ancients of Jerusalem. By the approbation of the living and
                           speaking tribunal, which all are commanded to hear, the Scriptures are not made true, altered or amended; they merely are
                           declared to be the infallible word of God, a point only to be learned by authority; hence that memorable saying of St. Augustine:
                           "I would not believe the gospel unless the authority of the Church moved me." (Conta ep. fund. chap. v.)</FONT></P><B>

                           but of the manner that St. Peter and he were to be employed. It was judged proper that St. Peter should preach chiefly to
                           the Jews, who had been the elect people of God, and that St. Paul should be sent to the Gentiles; yet both of them preached
                           both to Jews and Gentiles: and St. Peter, by receiving Cornelius, first opened the gate of salvation to the Gentiles, as he
                           says of himself, (Acts xv. 7.) <I>that God made choice</I> of him, that <I>the Gentiles</I> by his <I>mouth should hear the

                           nor even probable grounds to judge, that <I>Cephas</I> here mentioned was different from <I>Peter,</I> the prince of the apostles,
                           as one or two later authors would make us believe. Among those who fancied Cephas different from Peter, not one can be named
                           in the first ages[centuries], except Clemens of Alexandria, whose works were rejected as apocryphal by Pope Gelasius. The
                           next author is Dorotheus of Tyre, in his Catalogue of the seventy-two disciples, in the fourth or fifth age[century], and
                           after him the like, or same catalogue, in the seventh age[century], in the Chronicle, called of Alexandria, neither of which
                           are of any authority with the learned, so many evident faults and falsehoods being found in both. St. Jerome indeed on this
                           place says, there were some (though he does not think fit to name them) who were of that opinion; but at the same time St.
                           Jerome ridicules and rejects it as groundless. Now as to authors that make Cephas the same with St. Peter, the prince of the
                           apostles, we have what may be called the unexceptionable and unanimous consent of the ancient fathers and doctors of the Catholic
                           Church, as of Tertullian, who calls this management of St. Peter, <I>a fault of conversation, not of preaching</I> or doctrine.

                           Cyril of Alexandria,&nbsp;of Theodoret, Pope Gelasius, Pelagius the second, St. Anselm, St. Thomas Aquinas. In later ages,

                           more: so that Cornelius a Lapide on this place says, <I>that the Church neither knows, nor celebrates any other Cephas but
                           St. Peter.</I> Tertullian and most interpreters take notice, that St. Peter's fault was only a lesser or venial sin in his
                           conduct and <I>conversation.</I> Did not St. Paul on several occasions do the like, as what is here laid to St. Peter's charge?
                           that is, practise the Jewish ceremonies: did not he circumcise Timothy after this, an. 52[A.D. 52]? did he not <I>shave his</I>
                           head in <I>Cenchrea,</I> an. 54? did he not by the advice of St. James (an. 58.) <I>purify himself</I> with the <I>Jews in
                           the temple,</I> not to offend them? St. Jerome, and also St. Chrysostom,[2] give another exposition of this passage. They
                           looked upon all this to have been done by a contrivance and a collusion betwixt these two apostles, who had agreed beforehand
                           that St. Peter should let himself <I>be reprehended</I> by St. Paul, (for this they take to be signified by the Greek text)
                           and not that St. Peter was <I>reprehensible;</I>[3] so that the Jews seeing St. Peter publicly blamed, and not justifying
                           himself, might for the future eat with the Gentiles. But St. Augustine vigorously opposed this exposition of St. Jerome, as
                           less consistent with a Christian and apostolical sincerity, and with the text in this chapter, where it is called a <I>dissimulation,</I>
                           and that Cephas or Peter <I>walked not uprightly to the truth of the gospel.</I> After a long dispute betwixt these two doctors,
                           St. Jerome seems to have retracted his opinion, and the opinion of St. Augustine is commonly followed, that St. Peter was
                           guilty of a venial fault of imprudence. In the mean time, no Catholic denies but that the head of the Church may be guilty
                           even of great sins. What we have to admire, is the humility of St. Peter on this occasion, as St. Cyprian observes,[4] who
                           took the reprehension so mildly, without alleging <I>the primacy, which our Lord had given him.</I> Baronius held that St.
                           Peter did not sin at all, which may be true, if we look upon his intention only, which was to give no offence to the Jewish
                           converts; but if we examine the fact, he can scarce be excused from a <I>venial indiscretion.</I> (Witham) --- <I>I withstood,</I>
                           &amp;c. The fault that is here noted in the conduct of St. Peter, was only a certain imprudence, in withdrawing himself from
                           the table of the Gentiles, for fear of giving offence to the Jewish converts: but this in such circumstances, when his so
                           doing might be of ill consequence to the Gentiles, who might be induced thereby to think themselves obliged to conform to
                           the Jewish way of living, to the prejudice of their Christian liberty. Neither was St. Paul's reprehending him any argument
                           against his supremacy; for is such cases an inferior may, and sometimes ought, with respect, to admonish his superior. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           I am dead to the ancient law and its ceremonies. Others expound it, that by the law and its types and figures, and by the
                           predictions contained in the law, I know the Mosaical law hath now ceased, in which sense he might say, <I>by the law I am
                           dead to the law.</I> --- <I>If justice.</I> That is, if justification and salvation be to be had, or could have been had <EM>by

                           here expresses the change which had been wrought in him. The law to which he had been attached, had passed away from him.
                           Now he was so united to Christ and his cross, that he says: Not I, but Christ liveth in me. The strong expressions made use
                           of by St. Paul with regard to the Jewish law in this chapter, may appear strange, and very capable of a wrong interpretation.
                           But we must ever bear in mind that St. Paul speaks exclusively of the <I>ceremonial</I> part of the law, and not of the <I>moral,</I>
                           contained in the decalogue: of this latter he says in his epistle to the Romans, (ii. 13.) the doers of the law shall be justified.
                           But to effect this, was and is necessary the grace which Jesus Christ has merited and obtained for all, grace which God has
                           shed on all, more or less, from the commencement of the world.</FONT></P>

                                    how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as Jews?</font></p>

                                    by the faith of Jesus Christ; we also believe in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by
                                    the works of the law; *because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 But if while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also
