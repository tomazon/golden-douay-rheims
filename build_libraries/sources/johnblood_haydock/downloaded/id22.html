                           But there is no contradiction; for he first ascended to the top of the mountain, and then descended to an even plain, which
                           formed part of the descent. Here he <I>stood</I> for a while, and cured the sick, as mentioned by St. Luke; but afterwards,

                           three evangelists relate the cure of the leper in nearly the same words, and with the same circumstances, we may conclude
                           they speak of the same miracle. St. Matthew alone seems to have observed the time and order of this transaction, viz. after
                           the sermon of the mount; the other two anticipate it. The Bible de Vence seems to infer, from the connection St. Matthew makes
                           between the sermon of the mount and the cure of the leper, that it was not the same leper as that mentioned, Mark i. 40.;
                           Luke v. 12. (Bible de Vence) --- <I>Adored him.</I> In St. Mark it is said, <I>kneeling down,</I> chap. i. 40. In St. Luke,
                           <I>prostrating on his face.</I> It is true, none of these expressions do always signify the adoration or worship which is
                           due to God alone, as may appear by several examples in the Old and New Testament; yet this man, by divine inspiration, might
                           know our blessed Saviour to be both God and man. (Witham) --- "Make me clean;" literally, "purify me;" the law treated lepers
                           as impure. (Bible de Vence) --- The leper, by thus addressing our Saviour acknowledges his supreme power and authority, and
                           shews his great faith and earnestness, falling on his knees, as St. Luke relates it. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxvi.) Our prayer
                           should be such with great faith and confidence, qualified with profound humility, and entire diffidence of self.</FONT></P><B>

                           but not by touching in order to heal him, says Theophylactus. Besides, Christ would teach them that he was not subject to
                           this law. (Witham) --- "Touched him." To shew, says St. Cyprian, that his body being united to the Divinity, had the power
                           of healing and giving life. Also to shew that the old law, which forbad the touching of lepers, had no power over him; and
                           that so far from being defiled by touching him, he even cleansed him who was defiled with it. (St. Ambrose) --- When the apostles
                           healed the lame man, they did not attribute it to their own power, but said to the Jews: Why do you wonder at this? Or, why
                           look you at us, as if by our power or strength we have made this man to walk? But when our Saviour heals the leper, stretching
                           out his hand, to shew he was going to act of his own power, and independently of the law, he said: "I will. Be thou clean;"

                           (Witham) --- He did this to give us an example of humility, and that the priests, by approving of his miracle, and being made
                           witnesses to it, might be inexcusable, if they would not believe him. (Menochius) --- He thus shews his obedience to the law,
                           and his respect for the diginity of priests. He makes them inexcusable, if they can still call him a transgressor of the law,
                           and prevaricator. He moreover gives this public testimony to them of his divine origin. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxvi.) St. Chrysostom,
                           in his third book on the priesthood, says: "the priests of the old law had authority and privilege only to discern who were
                           healed of leprosy, and to denounce the same to the people; but the priests of the new law have power to purify, in very deed,
                           the filth of the soul. Therefore, whoever despiseth them, is more worthy to be punished than the rebel Dathan and his accomplices."
                           Our Saviour willeth him to go and offer his gift or sacrifice, according as Moses prescribed in that case, because the other
                           sacrifice, being the holiest of all holies, viz. his body, was not yet begun. (St. Augustine,&nbsp;lib. ii. &amp; Evang. ii.

                           to our Saviour. But there is no contradiction: for what a man does by his servants, or friends, he is many times said to do
                           himself. He came not in person out of humanity, but by his message shewed an extraordinary faith. (Witham) --- The centurion
                           shews a much stronger faith in the power of Christ, than those who let down the sick man through the roof, because he thought
                           the word of Christ alone sufficient to raise the deceased. And our Saviour, to reward his confidence, not only grants his
                           petition, as he does on other occasions, but promises to go with him to his house to heal his servant. St. Chrysostom, hom.
                           xxvii. The centurion was a Gentile, an officer in the Roman army. According to St. Luke he did not come to him in person,
                           but sent messengers to him, who desired him to come down and heal his servant, whereas he seems here not to wish him to come:
                           "Lord, I am not worthy," &amp;c. These difficulties may be easily removed. A person is said to appear before the judge, when
                           his council appears for him; so he may be said to have come to Jesus, when he sent his messengers.&nbsp;Or it may be that
                           he first sent his messengers, and afterwards went himself. As to the second difficulty, it may be said the messengers added
                           that of their own accord, as appears from the text of St. Luke. (Menochius) --- St. Augustine is of opinion that he did not
                           go himself in person, for he thought himself unworthy, but that he sent first the ancients of the Jews, and then his friends,
                           which last were to address Jesus in his name and with his words. ( lib. ii de cons. Evang. chap. xx.) Thus we see that the
                           request of the two sons of Zebedee was made by themselves to Jesus Christ, according to St. Mark; (x. 35,) and by the mouth
                           of their mother, according to St. Matthew, xx. 20.</FONT></FONT></P><B>

                           permits, that he may prove her faith, and reward her virtue and merits. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxiii. in Mat. viii.) The apostles
                           had followed their divine Master. They were with him, and executing his orders, and it is under these circumstances they are
                           overtaken with a storm. If their obedience to Jesus Christ, if his presence did not free them from danger, to what frightful

                           them, to rise superior to every storm and tempest, by invoking the all-powerful and ever ready assistance of heaven, and by
                           always calling in God to their help before they undertake any thing of moment. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           still.</I> (Witham) --- As before our Lord restored Peter's mother-in-law on the spot, not only to health, but to her former
                           strength; so here he shews himself supreme Lord of all things, not only by commanding the winds to cease, but, moreover, by
                           commanding a perfect calm to succeed. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxix.) How many times has he preserved his Catholic Church, when
                           (to all human appearance, and abstracting from his infallible promises) she has been in the most imminent danger of perishing?
                           How many times by a miracle, or interposition of his omnipotence, less sensible indeed, but not less real, has he rescued
                           our souls, on the point of being swallowed up in the infernal abyss? (Haydock) --- He commands the mute elements to be subservient
                           to his wish. He commands the sea, and it obeys him; he speaks to the winds and tempests, and they are hushed; he commands
                           every creature, and they obey. Man, and man only, man honoured in a special manner by being made after the image and likeness

                           reasons might be brought why our Saviour suffered the devils to enter into the swine: 1. To shew that the devils had no power
                           even over swine without his permission. 2. That such as were freed from their power, might acknowledge the greatness of the
                           favour done them, by seeing from how great a multitude they were liberated. 3. To punish those Jewish citizens, who fed upon
                           swine's flesh contrary to their law. And, 4. To shew how willingly the devils dwell in the hearts of those who are addicted
                           to the voluptuous and carnal life, aptly designated by the swine. (Menochius) --- St. Chrysostom says that our Saviour permitted
                           the devils to enter the swine, not for their own sakes, but for our instruction. 1. That we might know how very desirous the
                           enemy of our salvation is to bring upon us the greatest evils. 2. That the devil has not any power, even over swine, without
                           the permission of God. And, 3. That these cruel fiends would, if the Almighty allowed them, inflict still more grievous torments
                           on their unhappy slaves. (Hom. xxix.) Jesus Christ here confutes the Sadducean doctrine, which denies the existence of spirits,

                           greater damages. (Witham) --- The fear lest his presence might cause them some fresh loss, seems to have overbalanced, in
                           their estimation, the advantages they might have expected from his visit. (Bible de Vence) --- How often has our good Lord
                           wished to visit us, to honour us with his sacred presence, to enrich us with his divine inspirations; and how often, like
                           these Gerasens, have we desired him to depart from our territories? Some worldly interest, sensual enjoyment, or supine listlessness
                           on our part, has occasioned us to neglect the proffered advantages. Oh! can there be more marked ingratitude than this! Oh!
