                           The Jewish doctors hence infer, that if the corpse was found hanging or drowned &amp;c., or nearer a town of the Gentiles
                           than one of the Israelites, this law did not oblige. They are so exact as to dispute whether the distance must be measured
                           from the nose or from the naval of the deceased. (Selden, Syned. iii. 7.) But the law shews us, that the author of the murder
                           must be discovered, if possible, as the crime is so grievous as, in a manner, to defile the land, and draw down the vengeance
                           of God, if it be carelessly left unpunished. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           cities measured which city the corpse was nearest. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] iv. 8.) The Rabbins pretend that five of the
                           Sanhedrim were commissioned to make this enquiry, along with the magistrates of the neighbourhood. Others think that the <I>ancients</I>
                           were only the old men. The measuring took place only when the point was contested, and those cities are probably meant, which
                           were of sufficient importance to have twenty-three judges fixed in them. (Calmet) --- It was presumed that the nearest had
                           been guilty of greater negligence. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           not above three years old, say the Rabbins. The pagans esteemed those victims more agreeable to the gods, which had not been
                           yoked. Chermon observes, that the Egyptians rejected such as had been once "consecrated to labour." (Grotius) --- This circumstance
                           might here indicate, that the murderer was a son of Belial, or "without yoke;" (chap xiii. 13.; Menochius) and the heifer
                           was slain to shew what he deserved, and must expect if he be discovered. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           In such places murders are most frequently perpetrated. Hebrew may signify, "a desert," deep or inaccessible torrent, (Haydock)
                           on the side of which the heifer was to be slain, and its body was then, it seems, thrown into the water. The ancients first
                           washed their hands over her. Thus the victim of malediction against those who break a covenant, is buried in a ditch, or cast
                           into the sea. (Homer, Iliad i.) --- <I>Was.</I> Some translate the Hebrew "shall be," as if the place was to be hereafter
                           considered as unclean and accursed. (Calmet) --- The roughness and depth of the valley, denote the hardness of the murderer's
                           heart, and the depth of his malice. (Menochius) --- <I>Strike off,</I> or <I>c&#339;dent,</I> "cut the neck," (Haydock) at
                           the top, without perhaps separating it entirely from the body. Blood was given for blood, and this was the chief design of
                           the bloody sacrifices. For this reason, the Egyptians impressed a seal on the horns of the victim, representing a man kneeling,
                           with his hands tied behind his back, as if ready to receive the stroke of death. (Plut.[Plutarch,?] Isis.)</FONT></P><B>

                           We see here again the great authority of the priests, chap. xvii. 9. Hebrew, "by their word shall every controversy and every
                           stroke be tried," as the Protestants render it. (Haydock) --- Some understand by stroke, the leprosy, of which they were undoubtedly
                           the judges. But it is better to explain it of all wounds, and even of death, (Calmet) concerning which Moses is here speaking.
                           (Haydock) --- The Rabbins restrain the authority of <I>priests</I> as much as they can, to give greater power to their chimerical
                           Sanhedrim. They pretend that here&nbsp;they had only to pronounce the blessing, ver. 8. Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. 8,) joins
                           the magistrates with them in the whole ceremony. This awful meeting of so many people, tended to discover the authors of the
                           murder, as all would naturally converse together on the subject, and each person declaring what he knew, some suspicions might
                           at last be formed, which might by degrees lead to the detection. Josephus says rewards were proposed to any who might make
                           a discovery. Draco decreed, that on the very day when a murder was announced, if the author was not known, the whole people
                           (of Athens) should be purified. (Calmet) --- Abulensis insinuates, that if the murderer was present in the crowd, he might
                           be detected by blood gushing from the corpse of the deceased, &amp;c., as God often brings murder to light in a wonderful
                           manner. (Cic.[Cicero,?] Div. i.) (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           This was intended to testify that they were not guilty of the blood which had been shed, and that they wished to remove the
                           punishment of it from themselves upon the head of the heifer, (Calmet) the representative of the unknown murderer. So Pilate
                           conformed to this custom, when he condemned Christ on the bare accusation of the Jews; (Matthew xxvii. 24) and the priest,
                           at mass, washes his hands, as an emblem of that innocence, with which he ought to approach to the holy of holies. (Haydock)
                           --- Asterius was stricken with lightning, for touching the altar of Jupiter without having washed his hands. (Natal. Myth.
                           i. 10. 14.) The pagans generally purified themselves with fumigations, or by sprinkling sea water upon their bodies. Achilles
                           ordered the things which had been used to purify the Greeks, at the siege of Troy, to be thrown into the sea, as being unclean.

                           <I>Captives.</I> Some Rabbins say this was only lawful in what they call voluntary wars, which the Lord had not commanded,
                           as in those which were waged against the devoted nations, it was not permitted to reserve the women, even though they should
                           embrace the true religion. Calmet seems to be of the same opinion in the preceding chapter, to which he even refers. But here
                           he thinks, that upon their complying with the condition specified, they might be married, as Rahab was, and consequently this
                           law must be considered as an exception to those general laws, which prohibit matrimony with those nations of Chanaan, which
                           were otherwise ordered to be entirely destroyed, chap. vi. 16. "We believe, says he, that if these women changed their religion,
                           they might be espoused, of whatever nation they might be." He seems still to exclude the Chanaanite women, (chap. xxiii. 3,)
                           which variation of sentiment shews that the point is not to be easily decided. <FONT face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">(Haydock)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P><B>

                           first transports of victory; (Selden, Jur. v. 13,) though the pagans condemned it as unjust and contrary to reason. (Grotius,

                           for having violated a prisoner of war. (Plutarch) <B>&#8212;</B> Yet the Jews blush not to assert, that such liberties might
                           be taken even with married women, as their former marriage with a pagan was by some deemed null, and by others thought to
                           be dissolved. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] iv. 8) (Calmet) <B>&#8212;</B> The law, however, seems only to allow the marrying
                           of those who had <I>no husbands</I> before, as the women are only said to <I>mourn for father and mother,</I> ver. 13. (Haydock)

                           Septuagint, Philo, &amp;c. agree with the Vulgate; (Menochius) and the Hebrew may very well have the same sense. We must not
                           judge of the idea which others have of beauty, by our own sentiments. Some women in America have long nails, and esteem them
                           as marks of beauty and nobility; and in China, they let those of the left hand grow, and cut them in mourning. (Hist. Sin.
                           iii. 1.) The people of Mauritania take a pride in having long nails. (Strabo, xvii.) The Duke of Burgundy, not 300 years ago,
                           was distinguished among the slain, before Nancy, in France, (Haydock) by the length of his nails; (Calmet) and, in ancient
                           times, people never cut them in voyages at sea, unless to express their grief in extreme danger. <I>Huic fluctus vivo radicitus
                           abstulit ungues.</I> (Propert. iii.; Petron.[Petronius?]) Why, therefore, might not these captives follow the same custom,
                           as all depends on fashion? (Calmet) --- The woman being deprived of her ornaments, the passion of the soldier might probably
                           abate. St. Jerome (ep. 84,) applies this to worldly learning, which he endeavoured to make subservient to the truth, after
                           he had cut away what was dead and pernicious in it. (Du Hamel)</FONT></FONT></P><B>

                           greater evils. The soldier who has married a captive, may abandon her, if he set her free, (Calmet) which was but a slight

                           or less loved. (Haydock) --- The inheritance goes to the first-born independently of the father's disposition, in order to
                           prevent the disturbances which would otherwise have taken place in families, where the different wives would have been continually
                           endeavouring to get their respective children preferred before the rest. David indeed assigned the throne to Solomon, to the
                           exclusion of Adonias; but this was done by the command of God, 3 Kings i. 17. The regulation of Jacob, in favour of Joseph,
                           was made prior to this law. The Jewish doctors inform us, that a father cannot disinherit any of his lawful heirs, except
                           the judges ratify his sentence, while he is in health. But if he be dangerously ill, his verbal declaration will suffice,
                           provided he appoint some one whom the law does not reject. For if he were to make a Gentile his heir, the will would be null.
                           The testament must be made in the day time, for which they cite Ecclesiasticus xxxiii. 24. They say likewise that a father
                           may, while living, give his effects to whom he pleases, and by this means disinherit his children; or he may give the succession
                           to one of them, who is then considered as a tutor of the rest, and is bound to maintain them with necessaries till the year
                           of jubilee, when each may claim his respective share. (Selden, Succes. c. xxiv.) But all these regulations seem to contradict
                           the law. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           The Rabbins do not look upon children as bound by the law, till they be 13 years old. Their faults, before that age, are imputed
                           to the father, and he is to be punished for them. When, therefore, a son has attained the competent years, the father makes
                           attestation of it in the presence of ten Jews, declaring that he has instructed his son in the commandments, customs of the
                           nation, and daily prayers; and that he now sets him at liberty to answer, in future, for his own faults, praying that God
                           would enable him to lead a virtuous life. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           In considerable cities there was a tribunal of three, and another of 23 judges. The former took cognizance of the first accusation,
                           and condemned the stubborn child to be scourged: but the latter sentenced him to be stoned in case of a relapse, provided
                           both parents concurred in prosecuting their son, as they would not both surely be guided by passion. (Theodoret, q. 20.) The
                           Rabbins, according to their custom, modify this law, and exempt girls, orphans, and boys under 13 years of age. (Selden, Syned.)
                           --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] xvi. 17,) says that the parents laid their hands on the head of the undutiful, and then all the
                           people stoned him. Moses has not specified the punishment of parricides, (Calmet) as he deemed it next to impossible. (Haydock)
                           --- But we may hence judge how he would have chastised so heinous a crime. The Romans formerly sewed such wretches in a leathern
                           sack, (Cic.[Cicero,?] Invent. ii.) but afterwards they enclosed with them a dog, a cock, a viper, and a monkey; and having
                           first whipped them so as to fetch blood, placed them in a chariot drawn by black oxen, and hurled them into the sea or into
                           some river. (Justinian) --- Solomon sentences those who contemn their parents to be the food of crows and eagles, Proverbs
                           xxx. 17. No restraints were laid by the ancient Greeks on the authority of a father, as he was esteemed the most equitable
                           judge. (Sopater, ap. Grotius) (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Whether the person was first killed, as the Jews assert, or he was left to die upon the gibbet, see Calmet's Diss. It is also
                           a matter of doubt, whether he was nailed to the gibbet, or hung on it by a rope. (Bonfrere)</FONT></P><B>

                           were condemned to this reproachful death, and prayers were not said for them in the synagogue, as they were for other persons,
                           during the 11 months following their decease. (Calmet) --- They are not to be remembered before God. Their dead bodies are
                           to be buried before sunset, that the country may not be <I>defiled.</I> The punishment itself is extremely infamous, and the
                           name <I>of God</I> is often used by the Jews, to express something in the highest degree, as the <I>cedars of God,</I> &amp;c.
                           (Haydock) --- Some understand this passage, as if the body were not to be left on the gibbet, because man, being created to
                           the likeness of God, he will not allow the body to be insulted. Homer (Iliad xxiv.) says that Achilles offered an insult to
                           the earth, when he dragged the dead body of Hector round the walls of Troy. Others think, that the criminal having been treated
                           with due severity, as <I>accursed of God,</I> his corpse must not be deprived of decent burial. <I>Res sacra miser.</I> The
                           Jews refused this privilege to none but suicides, (Josephus, Jewish Wars iii. 25,) while the Egyptians and Ph&#339;nicians
                           suffered the bodies to rot upon the gibbet, whose inhumanity God here reproves. St. Paul reads this verse in a different manner
                           both from the Hebrew and Septuagint, leaving out <I>of God,</I> and substituting, with the Septuagint, the words <I>every
                           one,</I> and <I>on a tree. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written,
                           Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,</I> Galatians iii. 13. St. Jerome remarks, that on this as well as on other occasions,
                           he adheres to the sense, without following the express words of Scripture. He also observes, with Tertullian, that only those
                           are declared accursed by the law, who are hung for their crimes; and as Jesus Christ suffered, not for any fault of his own,
                           but being willing to appear in the character of one accursed, he has procured for us all blessings. (Calmet) --- In a mystical
                           sense, that man is accursed who is obstinate in sin, hanging as it were on the tree, which was the occasion of our first parents'
                           transgression. (Worthington) --- St. Jerome seems to think that the Jews have inserted <I>of God,</I> to intimate that Christ
                           was accursed of him. (Haydock)</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
