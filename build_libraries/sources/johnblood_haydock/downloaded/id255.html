                           All this chapter is a commendation and recommendation of faith, which <i>is the substance</i>[1] <i>of things hoped for,</i>
                           giving as it were a substance in our minds to such things as we are in hopes and in expectation of hereafter, and making them
                           present to us before they come to pass. --- It is also a sure <i>conviction</i>[2] <i>of things that appear not.</i> For when
                           God has revealed things, and we believe them upon the divine and infallible authority of the revealer, we have a greater certainty
                           of them than any demonstration can afford us. By this virtue of faith, they of old, our forefathers, <i>obtained</i>[3] <i>a
                           testimony</i> from God that their actions were pleasing to him. (Witham) --- Faith is the basis, the foundation supporting
                           our hope; for unless there be faith, there cannot possibly be any hope. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           The faith so highly commended here is not that <i>special faith</i> of sectarists, by means of which persons of various and
                           contradictory tenets pretend to assure themselves that their sins in particular are pardoned for Christ's sake, but a firm
                           and lively belief of all that God has revealed or promised.</font></p><b>

                           <i>A sacrifice.</i>[4] Literally, <i>a greater sacrifice</i> than his brother <i>Cain,</i> offering to God the best and fattest
                           cattle he had, <i>by which he obtained a testimony</i> (a mark of God's approbation) <i>that he was just,</i> and his piety
                           pleasing to God. St. Jerome, from a tradition among the Hebrews, thinks that this mark was, that fire descended from heaven
                           upon Abel's sacrifice and not upon that of Cain. --- <i>And by it, he being dead, yet speaketh. By it,</i> in construction,
                           may be either referred to his faith or to his sacrifice. Some expound it, that by reason of his faith, or of his sacrifice,
                           his memory still lives after his death, and he is commended by all good men. Others think that the apostle alludes to the
                           words which God spoke to Cain, (Genesis iv. 10) "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the earth," and that in
                           this manner he is said to have spoken after his death. (Witham) --- Men of all religions, whether true or false, have offered
                           sacrifices, as being the supreme act of religion; and therefore we may conclude, that what is so general and universal, must
                           have come from the instinct and light of our nature, and be a kind of first principle implanted in us by God himself.</font></p><b>

                           he was to suffer, as Isaac carried the wood up to the mountain where he was to have been offered. (Witham) --- <i>Parable;</i>

                           <i>Jacob....worshipping the top</i>[8] <i>of </i>Joseph's <i>rod,</i> or staff of command, or of his sceptre. See Genesis
                           xlvii. Jacob, by bowing to Joseph and his sceptre, acknowledged and reverenced the power of Joseph, whom Pharao called the
                           saviour of the world: and it is probable that Jacob, by the spirit of prophecy, knew Joseph to be a figure of Christ, and
                           his power to be a figure of the spiritual power of the Messias. (Witham) --- The apostle here follows the ancient Greek Bible
                           of the seventy interpreters[the Septuagint], (which translates in this manner, Genesis xlvii. 31.) and alleges this fact of
                           Jacob, in paying a relative honour and veneration to the top of the rod or sceptre of Joseph, as to a figure of Christ's sceptre
                           and kingdom, as an instance and argument of his faith. But some translators, who are no friends to this relative honour, have
                           corrupted the text, by translating it, <i>he worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff;</i> as if this circumstance of
                           leaning upon his staff were any argument of Jacob's faith, or worthy the being thus particularly taken notice of by the Holy
