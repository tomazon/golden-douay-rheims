                           to hinder the idol from interfering at present, and answered Balaam, in order that he might see the folly of his conduct,

                           from them, as being of a different religion. (Calmet) --- Indeed, when they applied for aid to the Egyptians, &amp;c., it
                           generally turned out to their detriment, that they might learn to trust in God alone, who would effectually protect them,

                           God had promised to multiply the seed of Abraham as the dust of the earth, Genesis xiii. 16. Balaam had just beheld several
                           thousands of them, and in rapture, exclaims, according to the Hebrew, "Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of
                           the fourth part of Israel?" Their camp was divided into four great battalions, surrounding the ark and the Levites. Who can
                           tell the number of one of these divisions, much less of all the multitudes there assembled, and what millions may, in a short
                           time, proceed from them? You have reason, therefore, O Balac, to tremble, if they continue faithful to their God. But strive
                           to make friends with them. --- <I>Let,</I> &amp;c. Hebrew may also admit of the version of the Septuagint, "May my soul die
                           among the souls of the just, and may my offspring be like this." We behold in this sentence, the sentiments of all worldly
                           and interested people, who wish to obtain a reward without submitting to the necessary labour. Impotent desires! selfish views!
                           (Haydock) --- "All," says St. Bernard, (in Cant. serm. 21,) "wish to enjoy the felicity which Jesus Christ has promised. But
                           how few are willing to imitate Him who invites us to do it." (Calmet) --- Thus, infidels desire sometimes to die like Catholics,
                           though they will not live in that religion. (Worthington) --- Even those who are in the Church, frequently give in to this
                           delusion, making fine prayers, and, in the time of temptation, forgetting all their sighs and tears, to whom God will say,
                           as St. Gregory justly observes on those words of Job, xli. 3, <I>I will not spare him nor his mighty words, and framed to
                           make supplication.</I> For, like Balaam, when the fit of devotion is over, such people are ready to give the most pernicious
                           advice against the lives of those, whom they pretend they would be desirous to resemble in death. "That prayer is vain, which
                           is not followed by continual perseverance in charity." (St. Gregory, Mor. xxxiii. 27.) The false prophet says not a word about
                           living like the just; he only wishes, that after his soul has enjoyed all the pleasures of this world, it may depart to joys
                           eternal, while his posterity is left behind in the midst of temporal prosperity. --- <I>Soul die,</I> or be separated from
                           its body. Even Balaam establishes the immortality of the soul. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           He has a mind to try a new experiment. We have observed, that the object of malediction was to be in view, chap. xxii. 41.
                           But Balac, supposing perhaps that the multitude made too deep an impression upon the soothsayer, judged it expedient to place
                           him in another situation, where he might see only <I>a part of Israel.</I> Some, however, imagine that he had only seen a
                           <I>fourth part,</I> or the <I>uttermost part of the people,</I> who lay nearest to him before; (ver. 10, and chap. xxii. 41)
                           and hence, would have him to take now a distinct view of the whole; and, in this sense, the Samaritan and Glassius translate
                           <I>from whence,</I> &amp;c., thus, "for thou hast seen only part of Israel, and couldst not see them all." (Calmet) --- By
                           a similar superstition, the Syrians imagined that the God of Israel was a God of the hills, and that they could more easily

                           The animal, of which the Scripture so often speaks, was remarkable for its strength, (Calmet) and could not easily be tamed,
                           Job xxxix. 9. (Haydock) --- The Septuagint generally translate <I>monoceros,</I> which is a fish, with a horn proceeding from
                           its upper jaw. This is often shewn in cabinets for the horn of the unicorn. There are various animals which have only one
                           horn. Pliny and Aristotle instance the oryx, &amp;c. Various authors of credit specify likewise the rhinoceros, which has
                           "a horn upon its nose," and is found in Ethiopia. The emperor of that country sent one to the court of Persia, which Chardin
                           saw and describes. It is as large as an elephant, and the people have learnt the method of taming both these huge beasts.
                           (Calmet) --- It seems the art was unknown in the days of Job, if this be the animal of which he speaks. (Haydock) --- Moses
                           (Deuteronomy xxxiii. 17,) seems to attribute two horns to the <I>ream;</I> and Pausanius allows a greater and a less one to
                           the rhinoceros; the latter is very strong and erect. It is of a brownish colour. (Calmet) --- Whatever may be the precise
                           meaning of <I>ream,</I> it certainly denotes an animal of superior strength, and very formidable. Balaam represents God, or
                           the people of Israel, in this light. God had given repeated instances of his dominion over all nature, in delivering the Hebrews
                           out of Egypt. They were also capable of striking the Moabites with terror, on account of their known prowess, and surprising
                           numbers, ver. 24. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           This may be joined to what goes before, as an explanation why Israel is so much to be feared; because the people have no dealings
                           with the devil, in which case neither he nor all his agents can hurt them, since God is their protector, and will direct them

                           <EM>the vain</EM> <EM>art of</EM> divination. Israel does not apply to augury. This very time will be memorable among their
                           posterity for the wonders which God has wrought." Indeed, never was there a greater display of the divine power in favour
                           of the Hebrews, than in this 40th year after their exit from Egypt; and in the following, which was noted for the victories
                           and miracles of Josue. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           is more natural and beautiful. (Calmet) --- The lioness, being solicitous for its young ones, becomes more furious. --- <I>A
