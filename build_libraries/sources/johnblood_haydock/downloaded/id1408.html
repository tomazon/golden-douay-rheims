                           strong men fighting with darts upon them." An elephant has been known to carry above 5000 pounds, and thirty-two men would
                           weigh no more than 4800. Pliny ([Natural History?] viii. 7.) observes that sixty people have been seen upon an elephant. Eupator
                           probably had his from India, where they are larger than in Africa. A person of that country was deemed fittest to manage them.</font></p><b>

                           a figure of the proud: but he might not therefore be one of the number, (Calmet) no more than Esau, who was a type of the
                           reprobate, Malachias i. 3. (Haydock) --- St. Ambrose (Off. i. 40.) highly commends the fortitude of this soldier exposing
                           himself to the danger of death for religion. (Worthington) --- This is the general sentiment. See Serarius; Menochius; Tirinus;

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And it came to pass, when the king heard these words, that he was struck

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And he remained there many days: for great grief came more&nbsp;and
