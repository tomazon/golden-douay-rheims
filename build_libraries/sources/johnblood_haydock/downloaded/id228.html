                           as in the Protestant translation. If men's intercessions to God in favour of others, are no injury to Christ, as our mediator,
                           how can it be any injury to Christ for the Angels and saints in heaven to pray or intercede to God for us? (Witham) --- St.
                           Augustine writes thus on this verse: By <I>supplications</I> are meant what are said before the consecration. By <I>prayers,</I>
                           are what are said in and after the consecration and communion, at mass, including the Pater Noster[the Our Father]; which
                           St. Jerome also says, our Lord taught his apostles to recite at the daily sacrifice of his body. (lib. iii. contra Pelag.
                           chap. 5) By <I>intercessions,</I> what are said after the communion: and by <I>thanksgivings,</I> what both the priest and
                           people give to God for so great a mystery then offered and received. (ep. 50. ad Paulin.) See St. Chrysostom on this place.</FONT></P><B>

                           that of his subjects. We pray for the emperors, says Tertullian, that God would grant them a long life, a secure throne, and
                           a safe family, brave armies, a faithful council, and a just people. In fine, that he would grant them peace, and whatever
                           else they could wish, either for themselves or their empire. (Apologet. cap. 30.)</FONT></P><B>

                           men to be saved.</I> They contradict this, and other places of the Scripture, as well as the tradition and doctrine of the
                           Catholic Church, who teach that God willeth only the salvation of the predestinated, of the elect, and as they say, of the
                           first-begotten only: and that he died only for them, and not for all mankind. But if it is the will of God that all and every
                           one be saved, and no one resists, or can frustrate the will of the Almighty, whence comes it that every one is not saved?
                           To understand and reconcile divers places in the holy Scriptures, we must needs distinguish in God a will that is absolute
                           and effectual, accompanied with special graces and assistances, and with the gift of final perseverance, by which, through
                           his pure mercy, he decreed to save the elect, without any prejudice to their free will and liberty; and a will, which by the
                           order of Providence, is conditional, and this not a metaphorical and improper will only, but a true and proper will, by which
                           he hath prepared and offered graces and means to all men, whereby they may work their salvation; and if they are not saved,
                           it is by their own fault, by their not corresponding with the graces offered, it is because they resist the Holy Ghost. (Acts
                           vii. 51.) If in this we meet with difficulties, which we cannot comprehend, the words of St. Paul, (Romans ix. 20.) <I>O man,
                           who art thou, who repliest against God?</I> may be sufficient to make us work our salvation with fear and trembling. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus: who gave himself a redemption for all.</I> Take all these words together, and
                           we may easily understand in what sense the apostle calls our Saviour Christ, the one or only mediator; that is, he is the
                           only mediator, who at the same time is our Redeemer; the only mediator who could mediate betwixt God, the person offended
                           by sin, and men the offenders; the only mediator who reconciled God to mankind by his incarnation and death, by the infinite
                           price of his blood, by his own merits, independently of the merits of any other. All Catholics allow that the dignity and
                           office of mediator in this sense belongs only to our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, made man to save us. The sense
                           then of this place is, that as there is but <I>one</I> God, who created all, so there is but one mediator, who redeemed all.
                           But yet the name of mediator is not so appropriated to Christ, but that in an inferior and different sense the Angels and
                           saints in heaven, and even men on earth, who pray to God for the salvation of others, may be called mediators, intercessors,
                           or advocates; and we may apply ourselves to them to pray, intercede, and mediate for us, without any injury to Christ, since
                           we acknowledge that all their intercession and mediation is always grounded on the merits of Christ, our Redeemer. The same
                           word for mediator, in the Greek as well as in the Latin, is given to Moses, God's servant. (Galatians iii. 19.) See also Deuteronomy
                           v. 5. The words of our Saviour himself, (Matthew xxiii.) taken according to the letter, contain an express prohibition of
                           being called masters, or fathers; and this reason is given, because all men have one Father in heaven, and because Christians
                           have one master, Christ. Yet no one can justly pretend from thence, that in a different sense, a man may not be called father
                           or master, without any injury to God, or to Christ. (Witham) --- Christ is the one and only mediator of redemption; who gave
                           himself, as the apostle writes, a redemption for all. He is also the only mediator, who stands in need of no other to recommend
                           his petitions to the Father. But this is not against our seeking the prayers and intercessions, as well of the faithful upon
                           earth, as of the saints and Angels in heaven, for obtaining mercy, grace, and salvation, through Jesus Christ. As St. Paul
                           himself often desired the help of the prayers of the faithful, without any injury to the mediatorship of Jesus Christ. (Challoner)
                           --- If there be other mediators among the Angels and saints, they are only so in subordination to the first[Christ], who by
                           themselves have no right to mediation or favours, and who cannot demand them but through the merits of him[Christ] who is
                           our only essential mediator. (Estius, Menochius, &amp;c.) Consult Judges iii. 9; 2 Esdras ix. 17; Acts vii. 35. --- <I>A redemption
                           for all.</I> Not only for the predestinated, not only for the just, not only for the faithful, but for all Gentiles and infidels:
                           and therefore he says again, (chap. iv. 10.) that Christ is <I>the Saviour of all men, and especially of the faithful.</I>

                           as well as from the writings of the earliest fathers, that the practice and condemnation of women interfering at all in spiritual
                           affairs, in not new. Tertullian says: We do not permit a woman to teach, to baptize, or to arrogate to herself any part of
                           the duty which belongs to man. (De Veland. Virg. cap. 9.) --- The woman has tried once to teach, when she persuaded Adam to
                           eat the forbidden fruit, and has wofully failed. Let her now be content to remain in silence, and subjection to man; (St.
                           Chrysostom on this place) as appears also from the order of the creation. See ver. 13. Seduction began with Eve, a subject
                           of profound humiliation for women; but this ought not to deprive them of confidence in God's mercy, nor take from them the
                           hope of salvation. (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>

                           be more properly rendered, from the Greek, by the <I>bringing up</I> of her children in faith, charity, and holiness. This
