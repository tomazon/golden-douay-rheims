                           came into the hall of audience, (Haydock) without being seen. None durst come even to this antichamber, without being called.
                           It was also death to appear with their hands out of their sleeves, (Cyrop. ii.) or to sit down, (Diod. xvii.) or look at any
                           of the king's wives in the face, &amp;c. (Plut. Artax.) --- This gloomy retirement was intended to keep up the idea of his

                           i.) --- The king's secret cabinet (Calmet) resembled, in magnificence, (chap. xv. 9.) the description which Ovid has given
                           us of the palace of the sun. (Tirinus) --- It was covered with gold and precious stones. Here he continued, almost inaccessible,
                           and business was despatched slowly. (Calmet) --- Agesilaus, king of Sparta, shewed how ridiculous these customs were, by acting
                           quite the reverse, appearing frequently among his subjects, and granting their just requests without delay. (Xenophon) ---

                           --- Few constitutions could have done without any thing. Yet after two nights and one full day were elapsed, Esther ventured
                           to go to the king, chap. v. 1. We have here another instance of places for prayer, Judith vi. 21. The old Vulgate has, "publish
                           a fast, and tell the ancients to fast. Let the infants be kept from the breast during the night, and let no food be given
                           to the oxen and other animals, while I and my maids shall fast," &amp;c. Then at the end of this chapter, in the Septuagint,
                           follow the prayers of Mardochai and of Esther, (chap. xiii. 8., and chap. xiv.; Haydock) which is their proper place. (Calmet)</font></p><font

                                    edict was come, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, wailing, and weeping, many using sackcloth and ashes
                                    for their bed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 Then Esther's maids, and her eunuchs, went in, and told her. And when
                                    she heard it, she was in a consternation: and she sent a garment, to clothe him, and to take away the sackcloth; but he would
                                    not receive it.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And she called for Athach, the eunuch, whom the king had appointed
                                    to attend upon her, and she commanded him to go to Mardochai, and to learn of him, why he did this.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And Athach going out, went to Mardochai, who was standing in the street
                                    of the city, before the palace gate:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And Mardochai told him all that had happened, how Aman had promised
                                    to pay money into the king's treasures to have the Jews destroyed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 He gave him, also, a copy of the edict which was hanging up in Susan,
                                    that he should shew it to the queen, and admonish her to go in to the king, and to entreat him for her people.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 She answered him, and bade him say to Mardochai:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 All the king's servants, and all the provinces that are under his
                                    dominion, know that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the king's inner court, who is not called for, is immediately
                                    to be put to death without any delay: except the king shall hold out the golden sceptre to him, in token of clemency, that
                                    so he may live. How then can I go in to the king, who, for these thirty days now, have not been called unto him?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And when Mardochai had heard this,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 He sent word to Esther again, saying: Think not that thou mayst save
                                    thy life only, because thou art in the king's house, more than all the Jews:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the Jews shall be delivered by
                                    some other occasion: and thou, and thy father's house shall perish. And who knoweth whether thou art not, therefore, come
                                    to the kingdom, that thou mightest be ready in such a time as this?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 Go, and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in Susan,
                                    and pray ye for me. Neither eat, nor drink, for three days and three nights: and I, with my handmaids, will fast in like manner,
                                    and then I will go in to the king, against the law, not being called, and expose myself to death and to danger.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him.</font></p>
