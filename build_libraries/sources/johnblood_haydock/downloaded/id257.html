                           honourable in all.</I>[2] It is doubtful both in the Latin and Greek, whether the sense be, marriage <I>is</I> honourable,
                           or <I>let</I> it be accounted honourable, as it rather seems to be by the rest of the text. Again it may be doubted whether
                           the sense be honourable in all persons, or in all things, and in all respects; as it seems to be the obvious signification
                           that persons do nothing to dishonour their state, as they do who violate by adulteries the fidelity they owe to one another,
                           who regard not the sanctity of this sacrament, who love not each other, who take not care of the education of their children.
                           It does not follow from hence, that all persons without any exception, even those who have already made a vow to God to lead
                           a single life, may lawfully marry. Such persons, by pretending to marry, incur their damnation. See 1 Timothy v. 12. (Witham)
                           --- Or, <I>let marriage be honourable in all.</I> That is, in <I>all things</I> belonging to the marriage state. This is a
                           warning to married people, not to abuse the sanctity of their state, by any liberties or irregularities contrary thereunto.
                           Now it does not follow from this text that all persons are obliged to marry, even if the word<I> omnibus</I> were rendered,
                           <I>in all persons,</I> instead of <I>in all things:</I> for if it was a precept, St. Paul himself would have transgressed
                           it, as he never married. Moreover those who have already made a vow to God to lead a single life, should they attempt to marry,
                           would incur their own damnation. (Challoner) --- As marriage is a great sacrament, (Ephesians v.) married persons should be
                           careful to honour and respect it, by chaste and prudent behaviour; (see 1 Peter iii. and 1 Thessalonians iv.) but it too often
                           happens that by criminal incontinence they change a great sacrament into a great sacrilege.</FONT></P><B>

                           grace of Jesus Christ is the true support of our hearts, and this grace is conveyed to us by means of the sacraments, especially
                           the holy Eucharist. Hence St. Ignatius of Antioch addresses the Ephesians as follows: "Brethren, stand fast in the faith of
                           Jesus Christ; in his passion and resurrection; breaking that one bread, which is the <I>medicine</I> of immortality, the antidote

                           (Witham) --- St. Paul has often mentioned the high priest and victim; here he tells us we <I>have</I> an altar, and of course

                           a more holy sacrifice of praise, than that which consisteth in thanksgiving, which the faithful offer now in the sacrifice
                           of the Church." (lib. 1. contra Advers. leg. and proph. chap. xviii.) And again in&nbsp;chap. xx., "The Church from the time
                           of the apostles, by an uninterrupted succession of prelates, offers to God in the body of Christ the sacrifice of praise."</FONT></P><B>
