                           you may not sin,</I> or not lose the grace of God by any considerable sin. --- <I>But if any man sin, we have an advocate
                           with the Father, Jesus Christ,</I> the eternal Son of the Father, who being made man to redeem us from sin, is our great Advocate,
                           our chief Mediator, and only Redeemer, by whose merits and grace we have been reconciled, after we had lost and forfeited
                           the grace and favour of God by our offences. He is the only <I>propitiation</I> for the sins of the whole world; for, as St.
                           Paul says, (Hebrews x. 14.) Christ, for <I>one oblation</I> on the cross, <I>hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</I>
                           All remission of sins, all sanctification, is derived from the merits and satisfaction of our Redeemer, Jesus Christ; not
                           but that the Angels and saints in heaven, and virtuous persons upon earth, when they pray to God for us, may be called advocates,
                           mediators, and intercessors (though not redeemers) in a different sense, and in an inferior manner, without any injury, but
                           on the contrary with an honour done to Christ; because what they pray and ask for us, is only begged and hoped for through
                           Christ, and by his merits. St. Augustine[1] in his commentary on this epistle, on these very words, <I>we have an advocate,</I>
                           &amp;c. prevents and answers this very objection of the late pretended reformers: (tom. iii, part 2. p. 831. Nov. Edit.) "Some
                           one will say: therefore the saints do not ask for us, therefore the bishops and governors of the Church do not ask for the
                           people." He denies that this follows, the saints being advocates in a different sense. Though God be our protector and defender
                           from dangers, this does not hinder us from owning the Angels to be our defenders in an inferior manner under God, as the Church
                           of England acknowledges in the common prayer book on the feast of St. Michael, and all Angels, which runs thus: "mercifully
                           grant, that as thy holy Angels always do thee service in heaven, so by thy appointment they may succour and defend us on earth
                           through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen." (Witham) --- The calling and office of an advocate is in many things proper to Christ,
                           and in every condition more singularly and excellently applying to him than to any Angel, saint, or living creature, though
                           these also may be truly so called without any derogation from Christ. To him solely it belongs to procure us mercy before
                           God, by the general ransom of his blood for our delivery; hence he is our only advocate of redemption, though others may be
                           and are advocates of intercession. Hence St. Irenæus (lib. iii. chap. 33. and lib. v. post med.) says: "the obedient Virgin
                           Mary is made the advocate of the disobedient Eve." Our Saviour declares that Angels are deputed for the protection of infants;
                           (Matthew xviii.) and frequent are the examples we find in the old Scripture, such as Genesis xlviii. 16.; Tobit v. 27. and
                           xii. 12.; Daniel x. See also the common prayer book, in the collect of Michaelmas day.</FONT></P><B>

                           a precept of the law of nature, and always obligatory, but because St. John and the other apostles had delivered it to them
                           long ago, i.e. when these persons were first converted. It may also be called a new precept, St. John recommending it anew
                           to them in this epistle, and declaring it to be enjoined in a particular manner by our Saviour Christ, after it had been misconstrued
                           and neglected, especially as it regards our neighbour, that is, every one without exception; so that if any one <I>hate</I>
