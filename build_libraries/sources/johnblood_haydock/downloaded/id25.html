                           thou he that is to come?</I>[1] (Greek, <I>who cometh?</I>) i.e. the Messias. John the Baptist had already, on several occasions,
                           declared that Jesus was the Messias. (John i). He could not then doubt of it himself, but sent his disciples to take away
                           their doubt. (Witham) --- St. John the Baptist sent his disciples not to satisfy his own doubts, but for the sake of his disciples,
                           who, blinded by the love they bore their Master, and by some emulation, would not acknowledge Christ to be the Messias. (St.
                           Chrysostom in Baradius) --- This expression of St. John is much taken notice of, as conveying with it a very particular question.
                           "Tell me, says St. John, now that I am departing out of this world, whether thou art coming to redeem the patriarchs and holy
                           fathers; or wilt thou send another?" (St. Thomas Aquinas) --- And St. Chrysostom also explains it thus, Art thou he that art
                           to come to limbo? but the Baptist omitting this last word, sufficiently indicated to our Saviour what was the purport of this
                           question. St. Jerome and St. Gregory say, that by his death, he was going to preach to the holy fathers that Christ, the Messias,
                           was come. John does not here propose this question as ignorant of the real case, but in the same manner as Christ asked where
                           Lazarus was laid. So John sends his disciples to Jesus, that seeing the signs and miracles he performed, they might believe
                           in him. As long, therefore, as John remained with his disciples, he constantly exhorted them to follow Jesus; but now that
                           he is going to leave them, he is more earnest for their belief in him. (St. Thomas Aquinas)</FONT></P><B>

                           and relate,</I> &amp;c. St. Luke here relates that Christ wrought more miracles when the disciple of St. John came than usual,
                           by which he proved in a much stronger manner than he could have done by words, that he was the Messias. For the prophets only
                           wrought miracles by invoking the name of God, whereas he did it by his own authority. (St. Cyril) --- The reason why our Saviour
                           did not return a plain answer in words to St. John's disciples is, because as the Jews expected the Messias to be a great
                           and powerful king, had he acknowledged himself to be the Messias in the presence of the multitude, he might have given umbrage
                           to the secular power, or afforded a pretext to the Scribes and Pharisees of calumniating him, and putting him to death before
                           the time preordained for his passion. (Baradius)</FONT></P><B>

                           life. Delicacies and effeminacy (the ordinary sources of fickleness of behaviour,) being found in the houses of kings, and
                           the great ones of this earth, were far from being desired by the precursor. This he shewed to the world by his garments of
                           camels' hair, his habitation in the wilderness, his slender and insipid food of wild honey and locusts, and the prisons to
                           which his constancy brought him. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxviii).</FONT></P><B>

                           out, before he was acknowledged in that character. Again, he was more than a prophet, in as much as he was the precursor of

                           and according to the erroneous opinion of men, of less sanctity than John. Maldonatus and Tolletus suppose the meaning to
                           be, that he who is the least in sanctity in the Church of Christ is greater than John; not that John did not excel in sanctity
                           many, nay even most of the children of the Church of Christ, but that those who belong to the Church, on account of this circumstance
                           of their being under the new law, which is the law of children, are greater than those under the old law, which was the law
                           of bondsmen, as the least among the children is greater than the greatest among the bondsmen. Now John in this respect did
                           not belong to the Church of Christ, as he was slain before Christ's death, before which time the gospel was not fully established.
                           (Menochius) --- <I>There hath not risen ... a greater,</I> &amp;c. This comparison, by what we find, Luke vii. 28, is only
                           betwixt John and the ancient prophets, to signify that John was greater than any of the prophets, at least by his office of
                           being the immediate precursor of the Messias. The comparison cannot be extended to Christ himself, who was both God and man,
                           nor to his blessed Virgin Mother; nor need we understand it of his apostles. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           and resisting our perverse inclinations. (Challoner) --- Certainly it is great violence for a man to look for a seat in heaven,

                           means eternal life. Or the meaning may be, the kingdom of heaven is taken by the violent, because it is not now confined,

                           have piped.</I> Christ, says, St. Jerome on this place, was represented by the children that piped, or played on pipes, and
                           St. John by those that mourned; because Christ refused not upon occasions, to eat and converse with sinners. (Witham) ---
                           Jesus shews the Jews by this simile, that he had endeavoured to induce them, by the common life he led, to an imitation of
                           his virtues; and they had not complied with his desire. --- <I>We have lamented.</I> This part is to be understood of St.
                           John, who led a most austere life, and notwithstanding was despised by the Jews. (St. Jerome in St. Thomas Aquinas) --- Similar
                           to this is the complaint of the Almighty, by the mouth of the prophet Isaias: <I>What is there that I should have done to
                           my vineyard, and have not done?</I> Our Redeemer and the Baptist imitated&nbsp;skilful huntsmen, who made use of various and
                           opposite stratagems, that if the nimble animal escape one, he may fall into another. As men are commonly more engaged by fasting
                           and austerities, therefore did the Baptist practise them in the highest degree, that they thus might be prevailed upon to
                           believe his words. Christ, condescending more to their weakness, did not embrace this rigid manner of life, though at the
                           same time he sanctified and approved it by his fast of forty days, and extreme poverty, not having where to recline his head.
                           It was better that our Saviour's doctrine should be approved of by one who practiced austerity, than that he himself should
                           fast and live rigidly. If the Jews admired fasting and penance, whose words should have led them to the Son of God? If fasting
                           appeared sorrowful and forbidding, why did they not join themselves to Jesus, who came eating and drinking, and compassionating
                           their infirmities? which way soever they chose they might have arrived at salvation? (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxviii.)</FONT></P><B>

                           wise, have made good use of the favours and graces offered them at this time of their redemption, when others have remained
