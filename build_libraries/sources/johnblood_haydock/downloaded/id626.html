                           Some say, without informing him, (Calmet) or them, (Menochius) what the unction meant. If he told the brothers, he would no
                           doubt take the necessary precautions to keep it secret, as the whole family would have been in imminent danger, if the transaction
                           had come to the ears of Saul, ver. 2. Josephus says, that Samuel only informed Isai in private: and David's brothers treated
                           him with no peculiar distinction. Whence it is inferred, that they had not been present when he was anointed. Some witnesses
                           seem, however, to have been requisite, as the title of David to the regal dignity depended on this ceremony, and none were
                           more interested than his own family to assert his pretensions. He now had a right to the kingdom, but not the possession;
                           being like a son expecting his father's estate as his future right, of which, as yet, he cannot dispose. (Calmet) --- <I>Came
                           upon,</I> to make him prosper. (Menochius) --- Hebrew, "came with prosperity; (Septuagint) impetuosity." God endued him with
                           all those graces which might render him fit to command. (Calmet) --- So David prays himself, "with a princely spirit confirm
                           me;" (Psalm l. 14.) or, <I>strengthen me with a perfect spirit.</I> Salien observes, that he did not now receive the spirit
                           of charity, as if he had hitherto been in enmity with God, (chap. xiii. 14.) but he began to advance in virtue with more rapid
                           strides, while Saul became every day more criminal and abandoned to the devil. (Haydock) --- David received the spirit of
                           fortitude and of prophecy, of which Saul had formerly had some experience, when he was first elevated to that high dignity,
                           chap. x. He was changed into a new man, and adorned with all that could render a king most glorious. Though he returned to
                           his wonted occupations, the spirit of the Lord enabled him to destroy wild beasts, as in play, (Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 3.)
                           and to compose and sing many of those divine canticles [the Psalms] which we still admire. (Salien, the year of the world
                           2969.) --- Whether he composed all the Psalms, as St. Chrysostom endeavours to prove, (præf.) we shall examine hereafter.

                           --- We no longer behold in Saul any generous sentiments. He falls a prey to melancholy, anger, suspicion, and cruelty. "He
                           was seized with an illness, inflicted by the devil, says Josephus, ([Antiquities?] vi. 9.) so that he seemed to be choking;
                           nor could the physicians discover any other means of alleviating his distress, except by employing some person skilled in
                           music.... David alone could bring the king to his right senses, by singing hymns with the sound of the harp. Wherefore Jesse
                           consented that his son should remain with the king, since he was so much delighted with his company." (Haydock) --- The Jews,
                           and many Christians, suppose that Saul's illness was melancholy, or "madness," as St. Chrysostom calls it. It was inflicted
                           by an evil, or even by a good angel, as the minister of God's vengeance, (Exodus xi. 4.; Calmet) who punished his former pride
                           and rebellion, by reducing him to so mean a condition. (Haydock) --- St. Augustine and Ven. Bede suppose, that the evil spirit
                           troubled him by God's permission. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           The effects which have been produced by music are truly surprising, if we may believe what the ancients have related. Our
                           music may not at present be so striking, or we may keep a greater restraint upon our passions, and moderate the exterior demonstrations
                           of our sentiments more than they did. (Calmet) --- But, in the present case, there was probably some miraculous interference.
                           (Haydock) --- The disciples of Pythagoras lay a great stress on music, to calm the passions, (Quintil. ix. 4.; Menochius)
                           or to rouse them. (p. 439.) (Haydock) --- It may also frequently contribute to restore health. (Gallien, &amp;c.) See chap.
                           x. 10., and 4 Kings iii. 15. (Calmet) --- But God made it so efficacious here, to shew the virtue of David, and the injustice
                           of Saul. (Worthington) --- Thus, by the prayers of the Church, the devil is expelled. (Theodoret) (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           Some think that this took place before David's victory over Goliath; others believe, that David was only made armour-bearer
                           to Saul, after that event. We must not disturb the order of the sacred historian without some cogent reason: and the courtiers
                           might already have heard of David's prowess and virtue, of which he gave such evident proofs, after he was confirmed by the
