                           first psalm. The difference is merely in words; for the division of the psalter at present is very different from what it
                           formerly was: sometimes a single psalm of ours being divided into many, and many of our divisions making only one, according
                           to the Hebrews. The latter are not even now agreed among themselves on the same division of the psalms. (Calmet) --- Some
                           suppose, that what we call the first psalm was originally looked upon as a preface to the psalter; others, that our first
                           and second psalms united in one. (Mat. Polus.)</FONT></P><B>

                           --- Some understand this as if it meant, predisposed by their docility, to receive the word of life. But the Fathers unanimously
                           understand it literally of predestination, which is defined by St. Thomas Aquinas, serm. i. qu. 23. a. 1. "The disposition
                           of God, by which he prepares, what he will himself perform, according to his infallible foreknowledge." In other words, it
                           is the manner in which God conducts a reasonable creature to its proper destiny, which is eternal life. In this mystery of
                           the Catholic faith, which cannot be clearly explained to human understanding, because it is a mystery, there are nevertheless
                           several points, which we know for certain. 1st. Though it is certain, that this decree of the Almighty is infallible, and
                           must have its effect, yet it is far removed from the blasphemy of Calvinists, who pretend that it destroys free-will, and
                           therefore removes all motives of exertion to good works. 2nd. For it is a point of Catholic faith, that this foreknowledge
                           of the Almighty no ways interferes with man's liberty, but leaves him still a perfectly free agent, and therefore responsible
                           for his actions. 3rd. It is likewise decreed by the Council of Trent, that no one can certainly know that he is of the number
                           of the predestined, without a special revelation to that effect. These are the most essential points, which it concerns us
                           to know of this doctrine. As to the consequences which may be drawn from these positions, it were better for us to submit
                           our understandings to the obedience of faith, than entangle ourselves in a maze of abstruse errors, far removed from our comprehension.
                           Would that this sober line of conduct were pursued by many moderns, who at present talk and write so much on this subject,
                           and to such little purpose. How excellently well does the great genius of the Latin Church, St. Augustine, say: Melius est
                           dubitare de occultis, quam litigare de occultis! How much wiser and better is it to confess our ignorance on mysteries, than
                           idly to dispute on mysteries! (lib. viii. de Gen. ad litt. chap. 5.)</FONT></P><B>
