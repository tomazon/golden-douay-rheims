                           is worthy of remark, that none of the disciples or friends of Christ, were so much astonished and struck at the many apparitions
                           of angels, &amp;c. as to be cast down to the ground, as the guards and his enemies were, but only through respect and reverential
                           fear looked down upon the ground. Nor even did any of them fall down prostrate to adore our Saviour, when he appeared to them;
                           because Christ was not now to be sought in the earth, among the dead, but was risen, and was to be looked for from heaven.
                           Hence is derived the Catholic custom of praying in Pascal time, and on all Sundays, &amp;c. not on the knee, but with the
                           body respectfully bent, and bowing <I>down their countenance towards the ground.</I> (Ven. Bede)</FONT></P><B>

                           Jerome thinks the Cleophas, one of the two disciples, was a citizen of Emmaus, and that he invited Jesus to take meat in his
                           house. His house was afterwards changed into a church, which the same Father says existed in his time. Some think Cleophas
                           was brother to St. Joseph; others, that he was husband of Mary, sister of the blessed Virgin Mary, and father of St. James
                           the less. Both the Latins and Greeks keep the feast of St. Cleophas, and give him the name of an apostle. Usuard says he was

                           observes, they might use this caution speaking before a stranger. (Witham) --- These two disciples were in the same error
                           as the other Jews; who expected that the Messias would deliver them from subjection to strangers, and re-establish them in
                           their ancient liberty. The cross and passion had been a subject of scandal and fall to them. They say, <I>we did hope;</I>
                           as if their hopes were now at an end. What increased their diffidence was, that Christ had promised to rise again the third
                           day, and some of the women had said that he really had risen. But they expected as public and glorious a manifestation of
                           his resurrection, as his death had been ignominious and known to the whole world. Behold, now this is already the third day
                           since these things are passed: if he had wished to manifest his power, he should have done it already. Thus the disciples
                           reason, as if the third day were already past, and as if it were certain that he was not risen again. So difficult a thing
                           is it to believe what we very ardently wish! (Calmet)</FONT></P>

                           apostles thought they saw a Spirit, either good or bad, that had taken the form of Jesus, and was come to deceive them. For
                           that they did not doubt spirits appeared, we have abundant proofs throughout the whole New Testament: and our Saviour, instead
                           of combating this opinion, seems rather to have confirmed it on more than one occasion. Indeed St. Augustine thinks it cannot,
                           without temerity, be denied, that there are occasional apparitions of angels, of demons, and the souls of the dead. (Calmet)
                           --- This, however, will not justify the credulity of many ignorant and weak people, who think that nobody can die, but their
                           spirit is sure to appear; much less will it justify the superstitious observations of unusual occurrences, which are so commonly
                           reported to happen, as significant of a departed soul. These occurrences are rare; nor should we suppose that the Almighty
                           would be willing to suspend or change the established laws of nature without a sufficient cause, viz. some known good either
                           to the departed soul, or surviving friends. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           that Christ brought such proofs, as he knew were sufficient to convince them of his resurrection, though they were not of
                           themselves demonstrations. For when they imagined they saw or touched a body, and that he eat with them, these things might
                           apparently be done by a spirit. See Genesis xviii. ver. 9. and Genesis xix. ver. 3. and ver. 16. where we read that angels,
                           in the shape of men, <I>eat,</I> and took Lot and his wife, and his daughters, <I>by the hand,</I> and led them away from
                           Sodom. Our senses, therefore, may sometimes be deceived, as may be shewn by divers other instances. But the arguments which
                           Christ made use of at this time, to induce the apostles to believe his resurrection, are to be taken with all the circumstances:
                           as 1st, with the corroborating testimonies of the Holy Scriptures, in which his resurrection was foretold; 2ndly, they called
                           to their minds what he himself had told them so often, that he would rise again the third day; 3rdly, concurred also the testimonies
                           already given by the angels, that he was risen; 4thly, the miracles at his death and resurrection; 5thly, Christ himself at
                           the same time opened <I>their understanding,</I> to know and believe this truth, that he was truly risen. (Witham)</FONT></FONT></P><B>
