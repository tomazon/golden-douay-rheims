                           Under these figurative modes of speech, or parables, Jesus Christ began to trace out for their reflection a true portraiture
                           of their ingratitude, and of the divine vengeance. By this <I>man</I> we are to understand God the Father, whose vineyard
                           was the house of Israel, which he guarded by angels; the place dug for the wine-vat is the law; the tower, the temple; and
                           Moses, the prophets and the priests, whom the Jews afflicted and persecuted are the husbandmen or servants. (St. Jerome) ---
                           This same parable was employed by Isaias, (v. 1.) where speaking of Christ, he says: <I>My beloved had a vineyard, and he
                           fenced it in.</I> (Tirinus) --- <I>He went into a far country,</I> not by change of place, for he is every where, but by leaving
                           the workmen the power of free-will, either to work or not to work; in the same manner as a man in a far country cannot oversee
                           his husbandmen at home, but leaves them to themselves. (Ven. Bede) -- This parable is thus morally explained: Jesus Christ
                           planted a Church with his own blood, surrounded it with evangelical doctrine, as with a hedge; dug a place for the wine-vat,
                           by the abundance of spiritual graces which he has prepared for his Church; built a tower, by appointing his angels to guard
                           each individual Christian, who are the husbandmen to whom he has let it out. (Nicholas of Lyra)</FONT></P><B>

                           forming out of them the one city and one temple of the faithful. (Ven. Bede) --- The Church is the corner, joining together
                           Jews and Gentiles; the head of it is Christ. By the Lord hath this been done in our days, and it is wonderful in our eyes,

                           instituted, were pleasing to God on account of their faith and piety, and not on account of their sacrifices; yet none were
                           agreeable to God who had not faith and charity. This Scribe seems to have been of the opinion of those who preferred the love
                           of God. (Ven. Bede) --- This excellence of charity teacheth us that faith only is not sufficient. (Bristow)</FONT></P><B>
