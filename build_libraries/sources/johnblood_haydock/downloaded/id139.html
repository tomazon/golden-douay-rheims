                           manner mentioned in the note on the last chapter, he had nevertheless done some good, which is recorded to his honour. See
                           Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, xx. 6. 11. and The Jew War, xii. But had this not been the case, a public orator seldom scruples
                           to gain over the man by praises, whose judgment he seeks. St. Paul was not ignorant of this rule of rhetoric, though he refuses
                           to imitate Tertullus by pressing flattery into his service, as we observe below, ver. 10. and Acts xxii. 1. and 3. See also

                           that had he been a seditious man, as he was accused, Felix would not have failed to have heard of his misdeeds before. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           being terrified,</I> &amp;c. When St. Paul spoke of God's judgments, and hinted at such sins as his conscience reproached
                           him with. (Witham) --- Whoever knows the infamous character of Felix and Drusilla, will not fail to admire the apostle's fortitude,
                           that he durst speak (as formerly John the Baptist did to Herod,) to them on the subject of justice and chastity. Suetonius
                           says of the former, that he married three queens. Drusilla, one of the three, was Herod's daughter, and wife of Aziz, king
                           of Emesa, whom he had seduced by the enchantments of a Jew of Cyprus. Hence it is not surprising he was terrified at the thoughts
                           of a future judgment, when expounded by a St. Paul, whose zeal to make these wicked people enter into themselves, hurried
                           him beyond the bounds of worldly prudence, but made such impression on his hearers, as to disarm the indignation his discourse
                           was calculated to produce. See Josephus, ut supra; Tirinus; Calmet; and others. Next to the worship of God, the Christian
                           religion requires of its followers, in the first instance, justice and chastity. Felix was unjust, avaricious, cruel; and
                           both Felix and Drusilla were guilty of adultery. Such was the wickedness of the Gentiles in those degenerate days, that fornication
                           was not looked upon as a crime. How much had they deviated from the excellent maxim we read and admire, inter Socraticas disputationes!
                           omnem virtutem niti continentia, et incontinentem nihil a bellua brutissima differre; that all virtue was built upon continency,
                           and that the incontinent man differed in nothing from the most brute beast. --- <I>At a convenient time I will send for thee.</I>
                           Such is the expedient Felix has recourse to, to silence the voice of conscience: and in this how often is he not imitated
                           by the sinner, who dreads nothing so much as to enter into himself. Why put that off to another time, which will never arrive?
                           Or why delay till death a repentance, which like the remorse of the damned, will then be as unavailing, as it will be eternal?</FONT></P>

                                    to hear us in a few words.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 We have found this a pestilent man, and an exciter of seditions among
                                    all the Jews throughout the whole world, and author of the sedition of the sect of the Nazarenes:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 Who also attempted to profane the temple: whom we apprehended, and&nbsp;would
                                    have judged according to our law.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 But Lysias, the tribune, coming upon us, took him away with great violence
                                    out of our hands,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 Commanding his accusers to come to thee: from him, thou, judging, mayest
                                    know concerning all these things, of which we accuse him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And the Jews also assented, and said that these things were so.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 Then Paul answered, (the governor making a sign to him to speak) Knowing
                                    that for many years thou hast been judge over this nation, I will with good courage answer for myself.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 For thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days, since
                                    I went up to adore in Jerusalem:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man,
                                    or causing any concourse of the people, neither in the synagogues,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 Nor in the city: neither can they prove to thee the things of which
                                    they now accuse me.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 But this I confess to thee, that according to the way, which they
                                    call a heresy, so do I serve the Father, and my God, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Having hope in God, which these also themselves look for, that there
                                    shall be a resurrection of the just and unjust.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 In this I myself also study to have always a conscience without offence
                                    towards God, and towards men.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings,
                                    and vows.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 *In which they found me purified in the temple: not with a crowd,
                                    nor with a tumult.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 But certain Jews of Asia, who ought to be present before thee, and
                                    to accuse, if they had any thing against me:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 Or let these men themselves say, if they found in me any iniquity,
                                    when standing before the council,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 Except it be for this one voice only, that I cried out, standing among
                                    them: *That concerning the resurrection of the dead am I judged this day by you.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And Felix put them off, knowing most certainly of this way, saying:
                                    When Lysias, the tribune, shall come down, I will hear you.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And he commanded a centurion to keep him, and to let him be easy,
                                    and that he should not hinder any of his friends to minister to him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And after some days, Felix coming with Drusilla, his wife, who was
                                    a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard from him the faith, which is in Christ Jesus.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And as he treated of justice, and chastity, and of the judgment to
                                    come, Felix being terrified, answered: For this time, go thy way: but at a convenient time, I will send for thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 Hoping also withal, that money would be given him by Paul: on which
                                    account also frequently sending for him, he spoke with him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 But *when two years were ended, Felix had for successor Portius Festus.
                                    And Felix being willing to gratify the Jews, left Paul bound.</font></p>
