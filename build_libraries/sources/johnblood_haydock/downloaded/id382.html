                           a manner, but that God will evidently confound their delusive signs, if they should even attempt to work miracles. (Haydock)

                           Many of the fathers think Moses here prays for the coming of the Messias, who was to be the deliverer of his people; (St.
                           Justin, &amp;c.) or he begs at least that one more proper than himself may be selected; in which some discover marks of pusillanimity,
                           others of great and laudable modesty; so that the anger of God here only means an earnest expression of his will, that Moses
                           should make no farther demur. Lyran supposes that Aaron was the person pointed at by Moses; and God grants his request. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           priests make themselves eunuchs without danger, by means of sharp stones. (Pliny, Natural History xxxv. 12.) Josue circumcises
                           with the like, Josue v. But any instrument will suffice. (Calmet) --- Sephora seized the first thing that came in her way,
                           to save the life of her husband, with whom God was displeased for this neglect of complying with the law, whatever might be
                           his pretext. It was not fit that he should be a legislator, who was not a pattern of obedience. (Tirinus) --- <I>Spouse.</I>

                           style their newly circumcised infants bloody spouses, in imitation of Sephora, who on this occasion perhaps addresses the
                           words to Eliezer. The Septuagint read, "Sephora...fell at his feet, and said, the blood of my son's circumcision has ceased
