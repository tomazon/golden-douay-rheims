                           Ghost from the womb of his mother; that Zacharias, when he prophesied concerning his son, and the blessed Virgin, when she
                           prophesied concerning our Lord, were both filled with the Holy Ghost; that Simeon and Anna were inspired by the Holy Ghost,
                           to declare the greatness of Christ. How can this be otherwise reconciled with this text of St. John, that by saying that this
                           gift of the Holy Ghost, after the ascension of Christ, was much more abundant than it had ever been before? <FONT size=3>It
                           had something which essentially distinguished it from all preceding gifts. </FONT>For we never read that men inspired by the
                           Holy Ghost before the coming of Christ, spoke languages which they had never learned. (St. Augustine, 4 de Trin. chap. xx.)
                           --- The Holy Ghost is still received, but none speak with tongues: because the Church herself, being spread over the whole
                           earth, speaks the languages of all. (St. Augustine, tract. 32. in S. Joan.) --- The primitive Christians of Corinth consulted
                           St. Paul on the subject of these spiritual gifts or graces, frequently communicated in the sacraments of baptism and confirmation.
                           In his Epistle, addressed to them, (1 Corinthians chap. xii.) he explains those gifts, and complains that some among the Corinthians
                           made not a right use of these gifts; especially those who had the <I>gift of tongues,</I> and made use of it rather through
                           vanity, than for the profit of others. In the last verse of 1 Corinthians chap. xii. he adds: <I>But be zealous for the better
                           gifts. And I shew to you a yet more excellent way.</I> And in the 13th chapter, he describes the excellence, the characters
                           of <I>charity</I> which he extols far above all other gifts. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>
