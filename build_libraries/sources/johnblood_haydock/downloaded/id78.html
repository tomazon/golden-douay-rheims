                           They watched all his actions, in order to have an opportunity of accusing him, and of putting him to death; whilst he, on

                           that Christ would at length cast a compassionate look upon him: who being well pleased with him, did not demand of him if
                           he wished to be cured, but without demur proceeded to work this stupendous miracle in his behalf. (St. Cyril) --- In which
                           Christ did not so much consider whether the action would give scandal to the Pharisees, as whether it would afford the sick
                           man comfort; intimating, that we ought ever to disregard the raillery of the fools, and the scandal which men of this world

                           by it. (Calmet) --- To take the lowest place at a feast, according to our Saviour's injunctions, is certainly very becoming;
                           but imperiously to insist upon it, is far from acting according to our Saviour's wishes, particularly when it is destructive

                           and spirit, which breathe nothing but charity and union. He merely wishes to purify our motives in the disposal of our charity,
                           by insinuating that there is more merit in giving to the indigent, from whom we can expect no remuneration. (Calmet) --- It
                           is only an effect of avarice, to be liberal to those who will repay us, says St. Ambrose. It is our duty as acknowledged even
                           by heathens (Cicero de Off. lib. i.) to assist those who stand most in need of it; but our practice says the same author,
                           is to be most obsequious to those from whom we expect most, though they want our services the least. St. Ambrose, Ven. Bede,
                           and St. Chrysostom are of the same opinion.</FONT></P><B>

                           this man we are to understand Christ Jesus, the great mediator between God and man. He sent his servants, at supper-time,
                           to say to them that were invited, that they should come; i.e. he sent his apostles to call the people of Israel, who had been
                           invited to his supper on almost innumerable occasions: but they not only refused the invitation, but also murdered the Lord
                           who had invited them. We may remark, that the three different excuses exactly agree with what St. John says: All that is in
                           the world is the concupiscence of the flesh, and concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life. The one says, <I>I have
                           married a wife,</I> by which may be understood the concupiscence of the flesh; another says, <I>I have bought five yoke of
                           oxen,</I> by which is denoted the concupiscence of the eyes; and the pride of life is signified by the purchase of the <I>farm,</I>
                           which the third alleges in his justification. (St. Augustine, de verb. Dei.)</FONT></P><B>

                           persecution. The spirit of the gospel is the spirit of mildness, and the compulsion which it authorizes to bring infidels
                           or heretics into the Church, is such as we use towards our friends, when we press them to accept of our hospitality. The great
                           pope, St. Gregory, forbade the Jews to be persecuted in Rome, who refused to receive the faith of Christ. "That is a new and
                           unheard of kind of preaching," says he, "which demands assent by stripes." (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           of the text is, that we must be in that disposition of soul so as to be willing to renounce and part with every thing, how
                           near or dear soever it may be to us, that would keep us from following Christ. (Challoner) --- The word <I>hate</I> is not
                           to be taken in its proper sense, but to be expounded by the words of Christ, (Matthew x. 37.) that no man must love his <I>father
                           more than God,</I> &amp;c. (Witham) --- Christ wishes to shew us what dispositions are necessary in him who desires to become
                           his disciple; (Theophylactus) and to teach us that we must not be discouraged, if we meet with many hardships and labours
                           in our journey to our heavenly country. (St. Gregory) --- And if for our sakes, Christ even renounced his own mother, saying,
                           <I>Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</I> why do you wish to be treated more delicately than your Lord? (St. Ambrose)
                           --- He wished also to demonstrate to us, that the hatred he here inculcates, is not to proceed from any disaffection towards
                           our parents, but from charity for ourselves; for immediately he adds, <I>and his own life also.</I> From which words it is
                           evident, that in our love we must hate our brethren as we do ourselves.</FONT></P><B>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 But when thou art invited, go sit down in the lowest place; that when
                                    he who invited thee cometh, he may say to thee: *Friend, go up higher. Then shalt thou have glory before them that sit at

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And he said to him also that had invited him: *When thou makest a

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the feeble, the lame,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And thou shalt be blessed, because they have not wherewith to make

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 When one of them that sat at table with him, had heard these things,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 But he said to him: *A certain man made a great supper, and invited

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And he sent his servant, at supper-time, to say to them that were

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And they began all at once to make excuse. The first said to him:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And another said: I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to try

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And another said: I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.</font></p>

                                    hither the poor, and the feeble, and the blind, and the lame.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And the servant said: Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And the lord said to the servant: Go out into the highways and hedges,
