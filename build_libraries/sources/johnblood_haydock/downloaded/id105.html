                           the tenth day of the month the Jews were accustomed to collect the lambs, and other things in preparation for the ensuing
                           great feast. On this day, likewise, they generally had a small feast, or treat for their friends, at which time Jesus coming
                           to Bethania, joined his friends in their entertainment. This was most likely in the house of Lazarus, Martha and Mary. Martha
                           served at the table herself, thinking herself happy in waiting on Jesus, whom she considered as her Lord and God. Lazarus
                           was one of them that were at table, to shew himself alive, by speaking and eating with them, and thus confounding the inexcusable
                           incredulity of the Jews. And Mary too shewed her loving attachment to Jesus, by anointing his feet with her precious ointment.
