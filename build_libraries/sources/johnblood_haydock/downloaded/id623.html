                           one year.</I> That is, he was good, and like an innocent child, and for two years continued in that innocency. (Challoner)
                           (St. Gregory) (Worthington) --- <I>Israel.</I> This verse is omitted in some copies of the Septuagint. It is extremely difficult
                           to explain. Some translate Hebrew, "Saul was a son of one year old," &amp;c. (Symmachus) Others, "Saul begot a son the first
                           year of his reign, (Raban) Isboseth, who was 40 years old when his father died, after governing all that while. (Serarius)
                           --- Syriac and Arabic, "In the first or second year of the reign of Saul....he chose," &amp;c. Hardouin supposes that the
                           people dated their years by his reign only so long. Some think that the Hebrew is imperfect; and an ancient interpreter has,
                           "Saul was 30 years old, when he began," &amp;c. (Calmet) --- The Rabbins and many commentators assert, that the reign of Saul
                           lasted only two years. (Tirinus) --- But some of them explain this, as if he reigned alone only that term before he was rejected,
                           when he could only be regarded as an usurper. Others, that he obtained the whole power for two years, after the death of Samuel.
                           Usher concludes that, during the incursions of the Philistines, he could hardly be said to reign, and these commenced after
                           he had been king two years. We might also translate, "Saul was the son of the year of his reign, (when he was confirmed at
                           Galgal) and in the second year....he chose," &amp;c. (Calmet) --- Perhaps the first translation, though somewhat mystical,
                           may be the most literal, shewing that for one year Saul continued to act with the most engaging affability and moderation.
                           But in the second he threw off the yoke, and was, in his turn, rejected by the Lord, as we shall soon behold. (Haydock) ---

                           Saul was 30 years old. This, and similar variations, he attributes to the compendious method of using numeral letters; (Kennicott)
                           an inconvenience very frequently attending all manuscripts, both sacred and profane. (Taylor)</FONT></P><B>

                           at the expense of the nation, that the people might begin to feel one part of the royal prerogative. (Salien, the year before

                           As soon as the next cities had heard the alarm, they sounded the trumpet, and so the news was conveyed to the most distant
                           parts, in a short time, Judges iii. 27. --- <I>Hebrews.</I> Probably those "on the other side" of the Jordan, who presently
                           came to the assistance of their brethren, ver. 7. (Osiander) --- It might also be the usual beginning of a proclamation. See
                           Daniel iii. 4. (Menochius) --- Septuagint and Aquila have <I>a</I> instead of <I>r</I>, in <I>hibrim.</I> "Let the servants
                           (subjects) attend." (Aquila) "The slaves have rebelled," (Septuagint) meaning the Philistines, who ought to have been subject
                           to Israel. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew, "and Israel was in abomination (stinking) with the Philistines." See Exodus v. 21. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "despised

                           This number seems almost incredible, as the Philistines were but a contemptible nation, compared with various others which
                           never brought so many chariots into the field. Zara, king of Ethiopia, in his army of a million men, had only 300, 2 Paralipomenon
                           xiv. 9. Adarezer had 1000, and Sesac 1200 chariots, while Solomon could only boast of 1400. Hence the Syriac and Arabic read
                           "3000;" and it is supposed that the Hebrew has <I>im,</I> at the end of <I>shelosh,</I> redundant. (Bochart, Capel, &amp;c.)
                           The number of horsemen would otherwise bear no proportion with the chariots. We must also observe, that under this name the
                           Scripture denotes those who upon the chariots. They were drawn by two horses, and one man guided the horses, while another
                           stood on the chariot; and in battle, eight other soldiers attended it. These remarks will tend to explain many difficult passages,
                           in which we read of chariots being slain and hamstrung, which may be understood of the men and horses, 2 Kings viii. 4., and
                           x. 18. In one place we read 700, and in another 7000 chariot were slain, (1 Paralipomenon xix. 18,) the latter number comprising
                           the 10 attendants; so here, the Philistines might have 3000 chariots, which being each accompanied with ten men, might be
                           counted as 30,000. (Calmet) --- Others think that there were 30,000 men fighting on chariots. (Lyranus; Salien) --- The Tyrians
                           might have come to the assistance of their old friends, as chap. vii. 10. See 3 Kings iv. 26. (Menochius) --- <I>Number.</I>
                           Josephus specifies "300,000 infantry." (Haydock) --- <I>Bethaven.</I> Many copies of the Septuagint read, "Bethoron," more
                           probably, as Bethel must have been on the east of Machmas, which lay north of Gabaa, chap xiv. 5. (Calmet) "over-against Bethoron
                           on the south." (Grabe) (Haydock) --- Hebrew also, "having Bethaven on the east." Bethel was called Bethaven after the schism
                           of Jeroboam, so that this name seems to have been substituted by a later writer, (Calmet) unless it might have had both names
                           long before, Josue xviii. 12. (Haydock) --- This is not contrary to chap. vii. 13, as the Philistines had been quiet for a

                           the people form the northern provinces, and provisions being cut off, by the immense army of the Philistines. (Calmet) ---
                           Providence was pleased to convince the people that, though they had been able to muster so large a force against the Ammonites,
                           at so short a warning, they must not depend on the efforts of their new king. (Haydock) --- He suffered many of the army to

                           Samuel.</I> Yet the prophet condemns his proceedings, either because he did not wait till the expiration of the seventh day,
                           (Calmet; St. Ignatius, &amp;c.; Salien) or because he ventured to offer sacrifice himself. (Lyra after Sulp. Severus, &amp;c.)
                           (Haydock) (Worthington) --- He had however the high priest with him; (chap. xiv. 3,) so that he might have performed this
                           sacred function, at the request of Saul: and we do not find that the latter is accused of sacrilege. (Salien) --- The magnitude
                           of the punishment is no proof of the nature of the transgression, as God often punishes, with great severity, sins which to
                           us might appear venial. (Haydock) --- This is true, particularly with respect to those who first dare to transgress a positive
                           command; (Numbers xv. 32.; Menochius) as Saul seems to have done the injunction of the prophet, chap. x. 8. The regal dignity
                           was a gratuitous gift. (Salien) --- With a trembling heart, we must consider how he was rejected for neglecting to wait so

                           by sacrifices. --- <I>Holocaust.</I> Hebrew, "I forced myself therefore," &amp;c. It is asked whether Saul offered sacrifice,
                           or caused it to be offered by the priests. The text seems to assert that he did it himself. Samuel and David did the like;
                           and we read that Solomon ascended to the brazen altar, at Gabaon, for the same purpose, 2 Paralipomenon i. 5. If it was lawful
                           to erect altars out of the tabernacle, notwithstanding the divine prohibition, why might not individuals also offer sacrifice
                           on certain solemn occasions? The Hebrew kings seem to have exercised some of the sacerdotal functions, particularly before
                           the building of the temple; for afterwards we find one of their kings severely punished for presuming to offer incense, 4
                           Kings xv. 5. (Calmet) --- Yet the proofs that they ever lawfully offered sacrifice, are not very satisfactory, as, in the
                           Scripture language, a person is often said to do what he enjoins another to perform on his account; and if some prophets have
                           acted in the character of priests, by divine dispensation, we need not extend the privilege to all who have dared to assume
                           the like prerogative. The law is clear. It is the duty of all who do not regulate their conduct by it, to know that they have
                           God's approbation. Their expressing no scruple on the occasion, proves nothing, no more than the sacred writer's omitting
                           to stigmatize their proceedings. But here, if Saul really offered the holocaust, the words of Samuel, <I>Thou hast done foolishly,</I>
                           convey a sufficient reproach: but if he did not, we must suppose that he blames the neglect of waiting the full term of days.

                           long. This seems to have been a threat, which Saul might still have escaped, if he had not proved disobedient again. St. Gregory

                           towards Saul, and that his followers might not be quite dispirited, as they knew that he had the thunderbolts of heaven in
                           his hand; and if he was with them, they had nothing to fear from the myriads of their opponents. His presence was very seasonable,

                           The Philistines had taken these precautions before Samuel gained the victory over them, and he consented that the people should
                           employ the Philistines as before, when he made peace with them; (Salien) or they had again begun to get the upper hand at
                           the beginning of Saul's reign, as the Israelites had been long in the enjoyment of peace, and negligent. (Tirinus) --- Josephus
                           extends this species of servitude only to the neighbourhood of Gabaa, and says the major part of Saul's 600 men "was destitute
                           of arms, because that country had neither iron nor people to make arms." The immense army which had so lately discomfited
                           the Ammonites, was surely not without weapons. But most of them had retired, (Haydock) and those who accompanied the king
                           might rely chiefly on their expertness in using the sling, Judges xx. 16. (Menochius) --- The brave men who came to join David,

                           the Hebrews were not deprived. In the defeat of Sisara, they had not a buckler nor a lance among 40,000 (Judges v. 8.; Calmet)
                           as the Philistines had already begun to deprive the Israelites of such weapons. (Haydock) -- Other nations have since imitated
