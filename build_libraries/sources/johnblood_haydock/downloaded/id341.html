                           <p><strong>Notes &amp; Commentary:</strong></p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 1.</strong> <i>Sennaar,</i> or Babylon. --- <i>Pontus,</i> Hebrew: Ellasar, perhaps Thalassar, as Jonathan
                           writes, not far from Eden. --- <i>Elamites,</i> or Persians. --- <i>Nations</i> in Galilee, east of the Jordan, whither the
                           conquered kings directed their course. Josue xii. 23, mentions the king of the nations (foreigners) at Galgal. (Calmet)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 3.</strong> <i>Now,</i> in the days of Moses. --- <i>Salt sea;</i> called also the vale of salts, and the
                           dead sea.</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 4.</strong> <i>Served.</i> Thus Noe's prediction began to be fulfilled, as Elam was the eldest son of Sem,
                           to whose posterity Chanaan should be slaves, chap. ix. 26.</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 5.</strong> <i>Raphaim, Zuzim,</i> and <i>Emim,</i> were all of the gigantic race, robbers, like the Arabs.
                           (Du Hamel) --- These dwelt in the land of Basan, or of giants, Deuteronomy iii. 13.</p>
                           <p><strong>V</strong><strong>er. 6.</strong> <i>Chorreans,</i> or Horreans, who dwelt in one part of that extensive range
                           of mountains, which took their name from Seir; perhaps about mount Hor, where Aaron died. (Calmet) --- These also were auxiliaries
                           of the five kings, and hence experienced the fury of the four confederates; who cut off all their opponents, before they made
                           their grand attack upon Sodom. (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 7.</strong> <i>Misphat,</i> or of judgment and contradiction, because there the Hebrews contended with Moses
                           and Aaron: it was afterwards called Cadez, Numbers xx. 11. --- <i>Amalecites,</i> that is which they afterwards possessed;
                           for as yet Amelec was unborn, chap. xxxvi. 16. (Menochius) --- <i>Amorrheans,</i> to the west of Sodom. (Calmet)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 10.</strong> <i>Of slime.</i> <i>Bituminis.</i> This was a kind of pitch, which served for mortar in the building
                           of Babel, Genesis xi. 3, and was used by Noe in pitching the ark. (Challoner) --- Moses does not make this remark without
                           reason. This bitumen would easily take fire, and contribute to the conflagration of Sodom. (Calmet) --- <i>Overthrown,</i>
                           not all slain, for the king of Sodom escaped ver. 17.</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 13.</strong> <i>The Hebrew,</i> or traveller who came from beyond the Euphrates, (Calmet) or who dwelt beyond
                           the Jordan, with reference to the five kings. (Diodorus)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 14.</strong> <i>Servants,</i> fit for war. Hence we may form some judgment of the power and dignity of Abram,
                           who was considered as a great prince in that country, chap. xxiii. 6. He was assisted by Mambre, Escol, and Aner, with all
                           the forces they could raise on such a short warning; and coming upon the four kings unawares, in four divisions, easily discomfits
                           them, while they were busy plundering the cities, and pursues them <i>to Dan;</i> which is either the city that went by that
                           name afterwards, or more probably one of the sources of the Jordan, (Haydock) which the people of the country call <i>Medan.</i>
                           Neither did he suffer them to repose, before he had retaken all the plunder at <i>Hoba,</i> or Abila, north of the road leading
                           to Damascus. (Calmet)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 18.</strong> <i>Melchisedech</i> was not Sem: for his genealogy is given in Scripture. (Hebrews vii. 6.);
                           nor God the Son, for they are compared together; nor the Holy Ghost, as some have asserted, but a virtuous Gentile who adored
                           the true God, and was <i>king of Salem,</i> or Jerusalem, and <i>Priest</i> of an order different from that of Aaron, offering
                           in sacrifice <i>bread and wine,</i> a figure of Christ's sacrifice in the Mass; as the fathers constantly affirm. (Haydock)
                           --- See Pererius. St. Jerome, ep. ad Evagrium, says, "Melchisedech offered not bloody victims, but dedicated the sacrament
                           of Christ in bread and wine...a pure sacrifice." See St. Cyprian ep. 63[62?], ad Cæcil.; St. Augustine, City of God xvi. 22,
                           &amp;c. Many Protestants confess, that this renowned prince of Chanaan, was also a priest; but they will not allow that his
                           sacrifices consisted of bread and wine. In what then? for a true priest must offer some real sacrifice. If <i>Christ,</i>
                           therefore, be <i>a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech,</i> whose sacrifice was not bloody, as those of
                           Aaron were, what other sacrifice does he now offer, but that of his own body and blood in the holy Mass, by the ministry of
                           his priests? <i>for he was the priest:</i> this is plainly referred to <i>bringing forth,</i> &amp;c., which shews that word
                           to be sacrificial, as in Judges vi. 18. The Hebrew may be ambiguous. But all know that <i>vau</i> means <i>for</i> as well
                           as <i>and</i>. Thus the English Bible had it, 1552, "for he was the priest." (Worthington) --- If Josephus take notice only
                           of Melchisedech, offering Abram and his men corporal refreshment, we need not wonder; he was a Jewish priest, to whom the
                           order of Melchisedech might not be agreeable. It is not indeed improbable, but Abram might partake of the meat, which had
                           been offered in thanksgiving by Melchisedech; and in this sense his words are true. But there would be no need of observing,
                           that he was a priest on this account; as this was a piece of civility expected from princes on similar occasions. (Deuteronomy
                           xxiii. 4; 2 Kings xvii. 27.) (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 19.</strong> <i>Blessed him,</i> as his inferior, and received tithes of him, Hebrews iv. 7.[vii. 4.?] This
                           shews the antiquity of the practice of supporting God's priests by tithes.</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 21.</strong> <i>The persons</i> (<i>animas</i>) the souls subject to my dominion. (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 22.</strong> <i>I lift up.</i> This is the posture of one swearing solemnly, by which we testify our belief,
                           that God dwells in the heavens, and governs the world. (Calmet)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 23.</strong> <i>Woof-thread.</i> The first word is added by way of explanation. Abram declares he will not
                           receive the smallest present for himself.</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 24.</strong> <i>Their shares,</i> due to them on account of the danger to which they had exposed themselves.
                           The king of Sodom could not but accept these conditions with gratitude. In a just war, whatever is taken by the enemy, cannot
                           be reclaimed by the original proprietor, if it be retaken. (Grotius, iii. 6. de Jure.)</p></font></font></font>
