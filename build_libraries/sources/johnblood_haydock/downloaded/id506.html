                           prophet,</I> or even <I>an angel from heaven,</I> as St. Paul (Galatians i. 8,) says on a similar occasion, (Calmet) should
                           work a miracle, and afterwards adduce it in proof of a false religion, believe him not. The Jews and Christians had already
                           received such convincing proofs from God, of the truth of what they had been taught, that they had reason to conclude either
                           that the miracle was false, or that the person who would persuade them to embrace a different religion had fallen, after God
                           had honoured him with miraculous powers: or, in fine, that if he were an impostor at the time when he exercised that power,
                           like the magicians of Egypt, or Balaam, the miracle was either not wrought in confirmation of what he preached, or at least
                           it was eclipsed by some greater miracle in favour of the truth. Whether God will ever suffer a real miracle which may seem
                           to countenance error, or not, this appears to be unquestionable, that he will never <I>deny himself,</I> or, in a contest
                           of miracles, permit falsehood to gain the victory. If the magicians performed wonderful works, they were forced at last to
                           confess their inferiority, and yield to Moses, Exodus viii. 18, 19. Miracles are generally a proof of the truth of any doctrine;
                           but when the doctrine is already established, as in this case of the unity of God, (ver. 2,) it may be adduced with propriety
                           as a criterion of miracles. Truth can never be in contradiction to truth. The light of reason suffices to evince that there
                           is but one God. The same truth had been repeatedly confirmed by miracles, particularly during the last forty years, during
                           which God had manifested his power over all nature, in the sight of all the Hebrews, and had trampled on the idols of the
                           Gentiles. If therefore any person should attempt, by his dreams or predictions, to invalidate this most fundamental and undeniable
                           article, his testimony could not be received. (Haydock) --- The Jews, in vain, allege this passage against the religion of
                           Jesus Christ. He did not subvert, but fulfilled the law; so far was he from endeavouring to persuade them to abandon the true
                           God. (Calmet) --- If he had not come to act in this manner, the law would have contained in itself the seeds of dissolution,
                           by <I>falsely</I> holding forth the expectation of a future Messias, who would bring all things to perfection, chap. xviii.
                           15., Genesis iii. 15., and xlix. 10, &amp;c. Hence when he really appeared, the Jews desired him to prove his mission by a
                           miracle, as he did repeatedly, Matthew xii. 38., John viii. 40., and x. 25. --- <I>A dream,</I> of a mysterious kind, like
                           those of Joseph and of the prophets. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           knowledge of natural causes, &amp;c., may enable an impostor sometimes to hit upon the truth. God may also, for reasons known
                           to himself, declare what will come to pass by the mouth of a false prophet, or of a wicked man, as he did by Balaam and Caiphas.
                           Judas wrought miracles before his apostacy. (Calmet) --- Yet if any who had been so highly favoured, should attempt to enforce
                           by their preceding miracles, any false doctrine, <I>let him be anathema,</I> Galatians i. 8. --- <I>Not.</I> The Hebrews had

                           Philo says, without any trial or delay; but the Rabbins allow that, although the impostor was not to receive an admonition,
                           no ignorance being able to excuse him, as in other cases, he was to be brought before the Sanhedrim, at Jerusalem, and strangled.
                           See Luke xiii. 33. The Jews, it is thought, condemned our Saviour on the plea that he was a false prophet, Matthew xxvi. 57.
                           They commonly required before this condemnation, that a person should have assumed the character of a prophet, and not barely
                           that he should have performed some wonderful work by his ingenuity. For if he only did the latter, and thereby endeavoured
                           to withdraw the people from the service of the true God, he was punished as a seducer. They also refused to condemn one who
                           had foretold evils, if they did not take place as was the case with Jonas and the Ninivites. (Haydock) --- But those who taught
                           or did any thing contrary to the law, in quality of prophets, were in danger of condemnation, unless their great reputation
                           might screen them from suspicion. Thus Elias offered sacrifice on Mount Carmel, without giving offence, 3 Kings xviii. 23.
                           If a true prophet bore witness to another, the latter might also claim respect. (Calmet) --- Yet though St. John the Baptist
                           had repeatedly commended Jesus Christ, the Jews did not hesitate to call him a <I>seducer,</I> and to put him to death. (Haydock)

                           ver. 13. If the city was seduced by one man, or by women, or by people of a different tribe, the culprit was only to be stoned,
                           and the Sanhedrim had to take cognizance of the whole affair. If many cities joined in the idolatry, or if any of them were
                           cities of refuge, &amp;c., they were not included. (Selden, Syned. iii. 5.; Grotius) --- But these limitations seem visibly
                           to contradict the law. The goods of the innocent were involved in the common ruin, that they might learn to make all possible
                           resistance to the introduction of so abominable a crime; and those of the guilty were destroyed wherever they were found.

                           (Haydock) --- Grotius (Jur. ii. 15) maintains, that the magistrate is authorized by the law of nature to punish those who
                           deny the existence of God or his Providence, as these errors strike at the root of all society. --- [<B>Ver. 16.</B>]<B> </B><I>For
