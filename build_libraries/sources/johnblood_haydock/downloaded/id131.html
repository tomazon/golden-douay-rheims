                           till the fifth verse of the 20th chapter, that St. Luke was absent on some mission during the time that elapsed between this

                           St. Paul inherited his right of citizenship from his father; it does not appear how Silas obtained it, perhaps by purchase.
                           There is no proof that Silas was a freeman of Rome. (Denis the Carthusian) --- It was forbidden by the Porcian and Sempronian
                           laws, for a Roman citizen to be scourged, unless he was likewise convicted of a capital crime. Cicero pro Rabirio. Facinus
                           est vinciri civem Romanum: scelus verberari. Id. cont. Verrem. The Romans were always very jealous of the dignity of their
                           city. We cannot but admire St. Paul's astonishing desire of suffering for the name of Jesus, in concealing a circumstance,
                           the very naming of which would have saved him the cruel scourging he suffered. If he now refuses to go out of the prison privately,
                           it is to vindicate his honour, and to avert the scandal, which the new converts would naturally feel, in seeing their master
                           treated as a criminal. He exemplified in this instance St. Augustine's principal; "Our lives are necessary for ourselves,
                           but our reputation for others." (Haydock) --- Estius declares, that Silas was also a Roman citizen, and that from this circumstance
                           he probably received a Roman name, as Paul did. For in other parts of Scripture we find him styled Silvanus. (2 Corinthians
                           i. 19.) and at the commencement of both the epistles to the Thessalonians. --- <I>Not so; but let them come,</I> &amp;c. St.
                           Paul patiently submitted himself to be whipped in a most disgraceful and cruel manner, which he could easily have prevented
                           or put a stop to, by saying, I am a Roman citizen. Afterwards, when they were for setting him at liberty, he claims his privilege,
                           he puts all the magistrates in a fright; they run to ask him pardon, and entreat him with all civility to leave the town,
                           which he does not think fit to do, till he visited his brethren and friends. (Witham) </FONT></P>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 So sailing from Troas, we came with a direct course to Samothracia,
                                    and the day following to Neapolis:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of part of Macedonia,
                                    a colony. And we were in this city some days, conferring together.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And upon the sabbath-day, we went forth without the gate by a river
                                    side, where it seemed that there was prayer: and sitting down, we spoke to the women that were assembled.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And a certain woman, named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city
                                    of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us, whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things which were spoken by Paul.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying:
                                    If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and remain. And she constrained us.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain girl, possessed
                                    with a pythonical spirit, met us, who brought her masters much gain by divining.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 This same, following Paul and us, cried out, saying: These men are
                                    the servants of the most high God, who announce to you the way of salvation.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And this she did many days. But Paul being grieved, turned, and said
                                    to the spirit: I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to go out of her. And he went out the same hour.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 But her masters seeing that the hope of their gain was gone, apprehending
                                    Paul and Silas, they brought them into the market-place to the rulers;</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And presenting them to the magistrates, said: These men disturb our

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And preach a fashion which it is not lawful for us to receive, nor

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And the people ran together against them: and *the magistrates tearing
                                    off their clothes, commanded them to be beaten with rods.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 Who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison,
                                    and made their feet fast in the stocks.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And at midnight, Paul and Silas praying, praised God: and they who
                                    were in prison heard them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations
                                    of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened: and the bands of all were loosed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And the keeper of the prison being awakened, and seeing the doors
                                    of the prison open, drawing his sword, would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying: Do thyself no harm, for

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 Then calling for a light, he went in, and trembling, fell down at
                                    the feet of Paul and Silas:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And bringing them out, he said: Masters, what must I do, that I may

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 But they said: Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all that were in

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And he taking them the same hour of the night, washed their wounds:
                                    and himself was baptized, and all his family forthwith.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And when he had brought them into his own house, he laid the table

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying: Let

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And the keeper of the prison told these words to Paul: The magistrates

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 But Paul said to them: After having beaten us publicly, uncondemned,
                                    men that are Romans, they cast us into prison: and now do they thrust us out privately? Not so: but let them come,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 And discharge us themselves. And the serjeants told these words to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 And coming, they intreated them: and bringing them out, they desired

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 And going out of the prison, they entered into<i> the house </i>of
