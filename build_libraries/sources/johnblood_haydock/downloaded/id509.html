                           Hebrew <I>abib,</I> "green ears of corn," when barley begins to ripen, and wheat is yet green in Palestine; at the time of
                           the year, which corresponds with half of our March and April. The Chaldeans called this month <I>Nisan,</I> "of the standards;"
                           because the armies then left their winter quarters. The first-fruits of the barley harvest were offered on the second day
                           of the paschal solemnity, Leviticus xxiii. 10., and Exodus xiii. 4. (Calmet) --- <I>Night.</I> We read (Exodus xii. 22., and
                           Numbers xxxiii. 3,) that the Hebrews were ordered not to leave their houses till morning, and that they departed from Ramesses
                           on the day after the passage of the destroying angel. They began, therefore, to prepare for their journey on the <I>evening</I>
                           of the 14th, and began their march at day-break on the 15th of Nisan, ver. 6. Their departure may be considered in its different
                           stages: <B>1.</B> Of eating the paschal lamb, with their staves in their hands; <B>2.</B> of being urged by the Egyptians
                           to depart, at midnight; <B>3.</B> of their leaving their respective homes, to meet all together at Ramesses; and lastly, [<B>4.</B>]
                           of their beginning their march from that place to leave Egypt. They did not, however, quit the confines till they had passed
                           the Red Sea, which took place effectually in the <I>night,</I> Exodus xiv. 20, 24. (Haydock) --- Thus they departed in the
                           evening, at night, in the morning, and in the open day. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           offered on the same festival, (Haydock) or victims proper for the solemnity, besides the paschal lamb, Numbers xxviii. 19.,
                           and 2 Paralipomenon xxx. 15. Peace-offerings were also made; (Leviticus vi. 12., and 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 7,) and of these
                           free offerings, some explain the words of the Jews, (John xviii. 28,) as they suppose the lamb had been eaten the night before.
                           (Menochius; Bochart; Tirinus) --- They might, however, have refrained from eating of these on that day. (Calmet) --- But they
                           perhaps did not choose to be debarred of that privilege. --- <I>There.</I> The place peculiarly consecrated to the worship

                           and slaves are forced to eat. The Jews serve the bread in small pieces, to denote their former poverty. This unleavened bread

                           or paschal lamb, which was to be sacrificed <I>between the two evenings,</I> during the space of about four hours, in the
                           court before the ark. Some think that this precept was binding only in times of peace; and that when the people could not
                           assemble in the place appointed, they might sacrifice the lamb elsewhere, which seems very probable, though no positive proof
                           can be adduced. In the reign of Amon, when the priests could not perform their sacred functions in the temple, they removed
                           the ark to another place: but Josias caused it to be brought back, 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 3. (Calmet) --- As the Jews have
                           now no temple, they cannot sacrifice the paschal lamb. (Tirinus) --- The priests were very expert, and observed an admirable
                           order in offering such a surprising multitude of victims, (Calmet) as would be offered by every family of ten people. (Haydock)
                           --- The blood, and perhaps the fat also, was presented on the altar of holocausts, which was very large, and the court exceedingly
                           spacious. (Calmet) --- <I>Which.</I> This may not signify the precise hour, but may refer to all the time while the Hebrews
                           were preparing for and commencing their journey. (Menochius) Ver. 1. --- Hebrew, "at the (return of the) season in which,"

                           it refer to the paschal lamb; the other victims might however be boiled, and the Septuagint use both expressions, "Thou shalt
                           boil and roast." See 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 13. It seems that Moses speaks only of the lamb, the method of preparing which
                           he had abundantly explained before. (Calmet) --- Hebrew has not <I>it,</I> and of course the passage may be understood of
                           all the victims offered on this solemnity. On the <I>morning</I> after it was concluded, people might all depart to their
                           respective homes. The Rabbins observe, that they could not do this on the morning of the 15th Nisan, as it was a solemn festival,
                           on which long journeys were prohibited, and they ought to wait till the end of the seventh day, to make their offering. Under
                           Ezechias and Josias, the people appear to have continued together during the whole octave, 2 Paralipomenon xxx., and xxxv.
                           17. (Haydock) --- Others are of opinion that the people might retire home after the 15th, (Tostat) or in the morning after
                           they had eaten the paschal lamb. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           think that by these feasts their solemnities are very much honoured. But the intention of the lawgiver, was only to keep them
                           at a distance from the profane rejoicings of the pagans, and to raise their thoughts and their hearts, by degrees, to the
                           more solid spiritual delights. There were, however, too much inclined to stop at the gratification of the senses, and understood
                           in that sense the <I>sabbath,</I> which Isaias (lviii. 13,) calls <I>delightful,</I> or delicate. (Buxt., Syn. x.)</FONT></P><B>

                           All were bound to make some offering, which was left to their option, and thus the festivity was much increased, by the abundance

                           by sentiments of piety and of religion. See Exodus xxiii. 15. (Calmet) --- While the masters of families were from home, <I>thrice

                           The pagans had consecrated different sorts of trees to their idols. They always planted groves near their temples, to increase

                           when they are designed for superstitious purposes. On other occasions, statues and pictures may be very instructive and commendable.
                           (Haydock) --- The patriarchs set up pillars, altars, &amp;c., as did also the Israelites, (Josue xxii. 10.) Samuel, &amp;c.,
                           even after this prohibition, and without any offence. The Rabbins allow, that the proselytes of justice do well in erecting
                           such monuments of religion, provided they be not intended for false worship. (Selden, Jur. ii. 6.) (Calmet) --- How blind
                           then must be our dissenting brethren, who cannot make this easy and obvious distinction, but indiscriminately condemn all
                           Catholics as guilty of idolatry, because they make and keep in their chapels, and bow down before images of the saints. This
                           trifling objection is pressed with great vigour by J. Wesley, the founder of the Methodists. "The Papists, says he, set up
                           their idols in their churches---they worship the picture of the Queen of heaven---they idolize a dead man or woman." To whom
                           Dr. Parker, a Protestant bishop, replies: (Disc. for the Abrog. of the Test.) "Yet, after all, we have no other ground for
                           the bold conceit, than the crude and rash assertions of some <I>popular divines,</I> who have no other measures of truth and
                           zeal, but their hatred of popery....As to the use of images in the worship of God, I cannot but admire at the confidence of
                           these men, to make so bold a charge against them in general, when the images of the cherubim were commanded by God himself,
                           Exodus xxv. 22. They were the most solemn and sacred part of the Jewish religion, and therefore, though images, so far from
                           idolatry, that God made them the seat of his presence, and from between them delivered his oracles. This instance is so plain
                           and obvious to every reader,....that it is a much greater wonder to me that those men, who advance the objection of idolatry
                           so groundlessly, (<I>against</I> the greater <I>part of Christendom,</I> as he observed before) can so slightly rid themselves
                           of so pregnant a proof against it." See an answer to the Rev. J. Wesley's <I>Misrepresentations,</I> &amp;c., by the Rev.
                           N. G. published at Whitby, 1811, where some of the variations in doctrine of the <I>pillars</I> of Methodism, are also briefly
                           noticed, as well as the absurdity of a man setting up for a reformer of religion, who at the time did not believe in Christ,
                           (Journal ii. p. 102-3,) and for forty-two years afterwards preached a doctrine either Popish (Jour. for 1739) or Antinomian,
                           than which, to use the words of his own recantation, "<I>nothing could be more false.</I>" (Minutes of a Conference, 1770.)
                           It may not be improper to observe, that in the last great deluge of error, the Methodist Society began, 1st May, 1738, at
                           London, though it had a more obscure beginning at Oxford, 1729, and another at Havannah, 1736. Yet even when this third grand
                           attempt was made to spread it wider, and to rectify former mistakes, the author acknowledges that he was not converted, no
                           not till many days afterwards, when, being in a <I>Lutheran</I> society! (26th May) "an assurance, says he, was given me,
                           that Christ had taken away my sins, even mine;" (Journal) and still, in the year 1770, he had to "review the whole affair."
                           Such is the man who has deluded so many thousands! <I>Out of thy own mouth will I condemn thee.</I> Surely those who wilfully
                           follow such blind guides, deserve to fall into the ditch. What confidence now can the Methodists have in the interpretations
                           which Wesley has given them of the Scriptures, since he stumbled in broad daylight; and even preached for above thirty years
                           together, that the observance of God's law is not only unnecessary, but <I>sinful,</I> an error to which he was forced, at
                           last, to open his eyes by the scandalous immoralities of several of his deluded admirers, whom he had been all along foolishly
                           flattering with the assurance that <I>faith alone</I> would ensure their salvation. Strange it may appear, that he should
                           not be put on his guard by the fall of Luther, who split against the same rock, and scrupled not to condemn the Epistle of
                           St. James as not worth a straw, <I>stramineam epistolam,</I> an expression for which he is said afterwards to have been sorry,
                           as Wesley was for the doctrine which he had been delivering for so many years. But the evil was then done. Multitudes had
                           been deceived by these arch impostors. Their surviving followers might however, if they would, derive this lesson from their
                           tardy repentance and recantation, to examine with more caution their other doctrines, which they have delivered with the like
                           confidence; and as they have reason to fear the yielding an implicit belief to such innovators, so they may be induced to
                           flee to <I>the ark,</I> the true Catholic Church, that they may be protected from <I>the contradiction of tongues,</I> Psalm
                           xxx. 21. (St. Augustine, ibid.) "After Christ and the gospel, we have no farther enquiry to make." (Tertullian) --- We know
                           that novelty in religion is a sure mark of falsehood, as no one can place any other foundation besides that which has been
                           fixed by the beginner and finisher of our faith. From the written and unwritten <I>Word of God,</I> we learn what He has taught,
                           and among the rest, we are authorized to keep holy pictures with respect. This is not an attempt against the worship of God,
                           but designed to promote it. We do not make them to <I>ourselves,</I> without a divine authority. The same things which we
                           are not allowed to <I>adore,</I> we must not <I>make.</I> Yet Methodists have and make pictures. We have God's will clearly
                           expressed to us by his Church, which he has commanded us to hear and obey. If we be led astray by so doing, we may at least
                           plead that we did, to the best of our judgment, as we were ordered by God; which those, who choose for themselves, cannot
                           do. If this Church, so strongly recommended to us in Scripture, be capable of deceiving us in an affair of so great consequence
                           as in that of idolatry, to what article of the Christian revelation can we yield our assent with safety? So, on the other
                           hand, if Luther and Wesley have grossly imposed on their followers, by teaching them to believe that Catholics are idolaters,
                           and that faith alone is necessary for salvation, as they are <I>self-convicted</I> in the latter point, how can their disciples
                           forget the old proverb, "A liar is not believed even when he speaks the truth;" and consequently, how can they take up their
                           faith on their bare word, though they may pretend to ground their doctrine on the word of God? They confessedly misapplied
                           that sacred word, with respect to faith alone, and they shut their eyes to the obvious meaning of the texts which forbid graven
                           things. Ought not, therefore, the unlearned and the unstable to dread lest they may have <I>wrested</I> the other Scriptures
                           to their own perdition? (2 Peter iii. 16.) See Exodus xx. This subject is of such vast importance, the accusation of idolatry
                           is of so black a nature, that it deserves to be accurately and frequently refuted. It is not an accusation brought only by
                           a few obscure individuals, who have not the power to do any great harm by it; the most exalted dignitaries of the Protestant
                           church, such as Dr. Shute, of Durham, in two charges to his clergy, the most famous modern reformers, like Wesley, &amp;c.,
                           have not scrupled to repeat the calumny; and the Legislature has, for many years, been actuated by what they perhaps have
                           thought a pious zeal, to exterminate the imitators of the Chanaanites! They may have listened too attentively to the intolerant
                           institutor of the love-feasts, (who seems, nevertheless, to threaten the overthrow of the established church) and who, in
                           the excess of his zeal, exclaims, "I insist upon it that no government, not Roman Catholic, ought to tolerate men of the Roman
                           Catholic persuasion." (Letter written 1780, a short time before the riots.) They must then be murdered, banished, or forced
                           into the church, that <I>little society</I> which began in the <I>evening</I> of the 1st of May, 1738, in Fetter-lane; (Journal
                           i.) for Methodists assert, that the God of this world <I>has hitherto triumphed over every revival of true religion,</I> (Dedic.
                           prefixed to the Life of J. Wesley, by Drs. Coke and Moore) and consequently over the reformed Church of England; so that they
                           can hardly insist, that we should embrace her doctrine, and thus increase the triumph of the devil. We have therefore no alternative
                           left, but either to abandon our country or our religion. These are the apostles, worthy of Mahomet, who would have us believe
                           that they are inspired by the Holy Ghost, and divinely commissioned to raise <I>another holy temple out of the scattered lively
                           stones of that</I> once beautiful building, which was erected by Jesus Christ, against which they say (Ibid.) <I>the gates
                           of hell have never </I><B>wholly</B> <I>prevailed.</I> These are the <I>teachers</I> whom they have heaped up to <I>themselves,
                           having itching ears,</I> 2 Timothy iv. 3. These are the interpreters of the sacred oracles! Both Wesley and Coke have, at
                           least, acquired great celebrity with their adherents, by their labours in this way; but how much their explications may be
                           depended upon, we may form some judgment from the preceding remarks. The character of bishop, which Dr. Coke extorted from
                           the hands of his great master, 10th of Sept. 1784, at Bristol, will not give us any higher idea of the sagacity of either.
                           It disgusted all thinking men, as a similar action of Luther, a fallen priest, consecrating a bishop had done long before.
                           Mr. Charles Wesley upon hearing of his brother having ordained a bishop, being but a presbyter himself, is said to have exclaimed,</FONT></P>
