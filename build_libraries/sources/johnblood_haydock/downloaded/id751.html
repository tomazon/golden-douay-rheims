                           <i>Anointed.</i> Hebrew has only, David. The rest of the title occurs only in some copies of the Septuagint, (Eusebius; Calmet)
                           and is not of divine authority. Yet if any attention be paid to it, we must suppose that David composed this psalm before
                           his second anointing, as he speaks of great dangers. But this is all uncertain. (Berthier) --- For dangers threatened David
                           even after he had been declared king. (Haydock) --- Before Samuel anointed him, he was not endued with the spirit of prophecy.
                           See 1 Kings xvi. 13., and 2 Kings ii. 4., and v. 3. (Calmet) --- Some suppose that he alludes to the entertainment given him
                           by Abimelech[Achimelech?] , (ver. 5 and 12.; Theodoret) or to that night when, fearless of danger, he took away Saul's cup;
                           (Ferrand) while Abenezra and De Muis rather believe, that he composed this psalm when his people dissuaded him from going
                           out to battle, 2 Kings xxi 17. It expresses the sentiments of the Levites in captivity, (Calmet) and most beautifully consoles
                           the just in distress. David did not write this for himself alone, but for all future generations. Hence it is not necessary
                           to discover the particular circumstance of his life, to which this and many other psalms allude; nor is there any difficulty
                           in explaining away the various imprecations, as they are not directed against any individual, but relate to all the enemies
                           of the soul; while they foretell what the wicked shall suffer. (Berthier) --- <i>Afraid.</i> "Find one more powerful, and
                           <i>then</i> fear." (St. Augustine) --- God both giveth light and strength, so that no enemy can hurt his servants, Luke xxi.
                           15. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           and Septuagint, "and my foes." This may denote domestic, and the former word public, enemies. (Haydock) --- <i>Weakened.</i>
                           Hebrew also, "have stumbled." Those who came to take Jesus Christ, verified this prediction, John xviii. 6. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           the Hebrew feminine pronoun, as they do with the Vulgate, ver. 4, <i>unam.</i> There is no neuter in Hebrew, which commonly
                           uses the feminine, <i>instead.</i> (Calmet) --- It may be deemed too scrupulous an exactitude, to express this in a version.
                           The word <i>petition</i> may be understood. (Berthier) (Menochius) --- The <i>one</i> petition of David comprised every blessing;
                           as he had his mind bent on heaven. (Du Hamel)</font></p>

                           <i>House;</i> the tabernacle, (Haydock) or temple, (Calmet) unless he may rather allude to God's presence and union, or his
                           enjoyment in heaven. (Berthier) --- He had already expressed a similar wish, Psalm xxv. 8. (Calmet) --- "When we love what
                           God approves, he will surely grant our request." (St. Augustine) --- David esteemed it as a special benefit to be in the Catholic
                           Church, which is the only true house of God. (Worthington) --- <i>Delight;</i> beauty and sweetness, as the Hebrew implies.
                           Many of the ancients read, "the will," <i>voluntatem,</i> with Sixtus V, &amp;c. But the edition of Clement VIII agrees with
                           the Hebrew and Oriental versions. (Calmet) --- To comply with God's will, is the only means of arriving at his beatific vision.
                           (Haydock) --- David was more grieved at being kept at a distance from the tabernacle, than from his own family. He envied
                           the happiness of those who could attend the divine worship. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           verse. But they may be as well explained in the sense of the Vulgate. Those who find themselves in danger, must still have
                           recourse to God's presence, (Berthier) where, as (Haydock) in the asylum of the tabernacle, (Menochius) or of the temple,
                           they will be protected. (Calmet) --- God rewards those with glory in death, who have suffered for his name. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           the <i>fruit,</i> or <i>calves of the lips,</i> Isaias lvii. 19., and Osee xiv. 3. (Calmet) --- David diligently recounted
                           God's benefits, with all his heart and voice. (Worthington) --- He offered sacrifices by ministry of the priests, on the altar

                           perceive their misery, when it is too late. (Berthier) --- David implores aid in this life, and deprecates the divine anger,
                           looking upon himself as an orphan, whom God takes under his special protection. (Worthingtonn)</font></p><b>

                           every human advantage, he may still say with St. Augustine, "They have taken from me what God gave, but they have not taken

                           of Canticles i. 7. (Calmet) --- It is a Hebrew idiom. (Haydock) --- Many find fault with the Septuagint and Vulgate in this
                           place, but without reason; and they do not agree in their versions. Symmachus and St. Jerome come near to us. <i>Puach</i>
                           means to breathe, or entangle; and our version intimates, that "iniquity has entangled itself:" <i>vipheach chamas,</i> "and
                           open lying." (St. Jerome) (Berthier) --- The accusers of Susanna, and of our Saviour, could not agree in their testimony.
                           The Chaldeans continually calumniated the captives, Isaias lii. 4., and Jeremias l. 33. (Calmet) --- Worldlings still do the
                           same, (Matthew v.) delighting in lies, which will prove their own ruin. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                                    <P>1 The psalm of David before he was anointed.</P>
                                    <P>The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear?</P>
                                    <P>The Lord is the protector of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?</P>
                                    <P>2 Whilst the wicked draw near against me, to eat my flesh.</P>
                                    <P>My enemies that trouble me, have themselves been weakened, and have fallen.</P>
                                    <P>3 If armies in camp should stand together against me, my heart shall not fear.</P>
                                    <P>If a battle should rise up against me, in this will I be confident.</P>
                                    <P>4 One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of
                                    my life.</P>
                                    <P>That I may see the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple.</P>
                                    <P>5 For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle: in the day of evils, he hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.</P>
                                    <P>6 He hath exalted me upon a rock: and now he hath lifted up my head above my enemies.</P>
                                    <P>I have gone round, and have offered up in his tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation: I will sing, and recite a psalm to
                                    the Lord.</P>
                                    <P>7 Hear, O Lord, my voice, with which I have cried to thee: have mercy on me and hear me.</P>
                                    <P>8 My heart hath said to thee: My face hath sought thee: thy face, O Lord, will I still seek.</P>
                                    <P>9 Turn not away thy face from me; decline not in thy wrath from thy servant.</P>
                                    <P>Be thou my helper, forsake me not; do not thou despise me, O God, my Saviour.</P>
                                    <P>10 For my father and my mother have left me: but the Lord hath taken me up.</P>
                                    <P>11 Set me, O Lord, a law in thy way, and guide me in the right path, because of my enemies.</P>
                                    <P>12 Deliver me not over to the will of them that trouble me: for unjust witnesses have risen up against me; and iniquity
                                    hath lied to itself.</P>
                                    <P>13 I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.</P>
                                    <P>14 Expect the Lord, do manfully, and let thy heart take courage, and wait thou for the Lord.</P></FONT></FONT><BR>
