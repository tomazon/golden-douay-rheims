                           uncleanness;</I> viz., such as was contracted in laying out the dead body, or touching it; or in going into the house, or
                           assisting at the funeral, &amp;c. (Challoner) --- <I>At the death.</I> Hebrew, "for a soul;" by which name the carcass is
                           here denoted, because it had once been ruled by the soul. (St. Augustine, q. 81.) This law related only to the family of Aaron,
                           when no absolute necessity or near relationship required their attendance. When such offices of charity should be deemed defiling,
                           it is not easy to say. But the ancients generally looked upon them in this light, chap. x. 6. Porphyrius enquired of Anebo,
                           why the <I>holy inspector</I> touched not the dead, since in all sacred transactions, the death of animals generally intervenes.
                           We know not the answer of this pretended prophet Egypt; and Jamblicus confesses, that he cannot resolve the difficulty. The
                           Romans placed a branch of cypress before the door where a corpse was lying, lest any priest might see it unthinkingly, and
                           be defiled. (Servius) "At their return from a funeral they sprinkled themselves with water, and passed over fire." (Festus)
                           The Rabbins say, that no one could be buried in Jerusalem, nor in the towns of the Levites, on account of the sanctity of
                           those places, and for fear lest the priests might thus contract some uncleanness. (Calmet) --- To account for all these regulations,
                           we only need to observe that such was the will of God; and here it may surely be said, <I>stat pro ratione voluntas.</I> He
                           might thus intend to exercise their obedience; to keep their minds from being too much depressed by the sight of the dead,
                           and to remind us all that we ought carefully to avoid sin, which kills the soul, and renders us really unclean before God.

                           probably assert, even this is not permitted. She is not one of the persons privileged, ver. 2, and Ezechiel xliv. 25. Ezechiel
                           (xxiv. 16,) receives a command not to bewail the death of his wife. The Romans thought their priests would be defiled, by
                           attending the funerals even of their own wives; and Sylla, going to dedicate a temple to Hercules, sent Metella a bill of

                           simple fornication: the man was bound to marry them, if the father consented; and, at any rate, he was forced to give them

                           This is to be understood in the same sense. He must not leave his sacred functions to attend any corpse whatever. Having the
                           honour of representing God, and being his first minister on earth, the utmost purity is required of him. Inferior priests
                           may mourn on some occasions; and the Levites are not distinguished, in this respect, from the people; to shew that God requires&nbsp;sanctity

                           Such is the high priest in the temple. Let Christian priests hence learn what sanctity will be required of them. But why is
                           the pontiff forbidden to bury <I>his father,</I> since he obtains that dignity after his decease. St. Augustine (q. 83,) answers,
                           that he was to be consecrated immediately after, that he might offer incense. Another might, however, perform that office.
                           On some occasions, the high priest was deposed, or the dignity transferred to another family. Infirmities might also hinder
                           him from performing the duty. (Calmet) --- Priests must be detached, as much as possible, from all things which might divert
                           them from their sacred offices. The greatest holiness is required of those who receive the body of Jesus Christ. (Du Hamel)</FONT></P><B>

                           Josephus says he could not divorce her. The Rabbins allow him only one wife at a time. It is said that Joiada had two. But
                           that might be successively; and it is not certain that he was the high priest; (2 Paralipomenon xxiv. 3.; Calmet) though he
                           has that title in the Vulgate, 2 Paralipomenon xxii. 11. (Haydock) --- His wife must be an Isrealite. The Septuagint intimates,
                           "of his own race." But this is denied by others. He could not marry his brother's widow, (Selden) nor a girl under twelve
