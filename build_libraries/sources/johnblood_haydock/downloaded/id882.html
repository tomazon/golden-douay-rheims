                           <i>Eightieth year.</i> This chronology meets with the approbation of most people. See Usher. (Chap. xii.) Some, however, find
                           a difficulty in reconciling it with Acts xiii. 20., which seems to attribute 450 years to the government of the judges. (Calmet)
                           --- Septuagint have 440; Josephus 592, though Ruffin neglects the 90 in his version; Petau 520; Severus 582; Clement of Alexandria
                           566; Vossius 580; Cano 590; Serarius 680. --- Houbigant would read 350 in the Acts. But Capellus would add 100 here, &amp;c.
                           (Haydock) --- <i>Second</i> of the sacred year, corresponding with our April. Syriac, Chaldean styles it "of the splendour
                           of flowers." (Menochius) --- The Hurons, and other nations of America, call this "the moon of plants;" the Flemings, "the
                           month for mowing," <i>Grasmaand.</i> Our Saxon ancestors gave descriptive names to the months. See Verstegan. (Haydock) ---
                           At first, the Hebrews only described the months by their order; "first, second," &amp;c. In Solomon's time we begin to find
                           other names, taken from the Phenicians, (Scaliger) Chaldean names were adopted; (Haydock) <b>1.</b> Nisan; <b>2.</b> Jar;

                           to the lunar system, which was not perhaps yet adopted. Each of these months generally corresponded with two of ours; Nisan
                           with the end of March and the beginning of April, &amp;c. Septuagint here take no notice of Zio, though they do, ver. 37.
                           (Haydock) --- The temple was begun on Monday, May 21, in the year of the world 2992. (Usher) --- It was finished in the year
                           of the world 3000, or in the following year, when it was solemnly dedicated. (Button.)</font></p><b>

                           <i>House.</i> Hebrew <i>Habayith,</i> "the palace" of the God of Israel, where the priests alone had access. It was surrounded
                           by various courts and apartments, as the ancient temples were very different from ours. All these appendages sometimes go
                           under the common name of the temple. (Calmet) --- <i>Cubits.</i> The common one contained half a yard. The sacred cubit amounted
                           to 21,888 inches. (Arbuthnot) (Ezechiel xliii. 13.) --- Calmet makes the cubit consist of 24 fingers' breadth, or little less
                           than 20 inches of the French measure, which is greater than ours. (Haydock) --- Hence the temple would be 102½ feet long,
                           34 feet 2 inches broad, 51 feet 3 inches high to the ceiling. (Calmet) --- The walls are not included; else the breadth would
                           be almost 60 cubits, the length 100, and the height 50. (Vallalpand ii. 5, 14.) (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           iii. 4. But one word seems there to have been substituted for another, (Calmet) unless it might resemble a high tower. (Haydock)
                           --- Before the porch were placed the two brazen pillars. The interior of it was highly adorned by Herod. (Josephus, Antiquities

                           was yet used. (Calmet) --- These windows occupied the five cubits above the chambers, which were built on the west end, and
                           on the sides of the temple, 15 cubits high. (Calmet) --- No windows were permitted in the holy of holies. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           were used, to strengthen the building. Septuagint, "ribs," (Menochius) or sides. But there seem rather to have been three
                           off-sets; so that the wall kept decreasing in breadth, as it grew higher, (Haydock) every ten cubits, (Ezechiel xli. 6.; Menochius)
                           and thus the upper chamber was two cubits broader than the lowest. The beams might thus rest upon the walls, and be easily
                           changed. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           on the three sides. St. Jerome seems to double that number; while Josephus acknowledges only 30. (Calmet) --- Salien has 42,

                           faithful) must first be hewn and polished here by many trials and sufferings, before they can be admitted to have a place
                           in that celestial structure. (Challoner) --- Those who have the happiness to be chosen, will be no more disturbed with the
                           <i>noise</i> or inconvenience of persecution, (Haydock) which they ought to bear in silence upon earth. (Worthington) ---
                           <i>Building.</i> Screw nails were probably used. The ancient Romans wrought the mouldings, &amp;c., of their pillars, after
                           they were erected. The Rabbins pretend that a little worm, or stone <i>schamir,</i> which was brought from the earthly paradise
                           by an eagle, or by the devil, Asmodeus, polished all the stones. Maimonides has even written a book on this famous worm. (Grotius)
                           --- Theodoret (q. 23.) also asserts, without proof, that the stones were found ready cut, in the quarry, and that they had
                           only to be polished. We may form a grand idea of the workmen employed by Solomon, when we consider that they were able to
                           prepare all things, with such exactitude, at a distance. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           from the middle to the third story. (Haydock) --- This sense is very clear. Hebrew intimates that the staircase was <i>round</i>
                           like a screw, and was formed in the wall, at one end of the rooms. --- <i>Right hand</i> of those who entered the temple,

                           and says, "This is the house," by way of eminence. As thou hast endeavoured to honour my name, I will not only fulfil my promises

                           stone, with a third of wood, in all three cubits high. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] viii. 2.) (Villalpand) --- But the sacred
                           writers seem rather to indicate, that beams of cedar were fixed in the walls, at the distance of three courses of stone, even
                           to the top. This mode of architecture is clearly mentioned, chap. vii. 12., 1 Esdras vi. 3, 4., and v. 8., and Habacuc ii.
                           11. The ancients admired such a variety, and deemed the building more solid. (Vit. i. 5.) Eupolemus (ap. Eusebius, præp. ix.
                           34.) takes notice, that these beams were fastened together, in the temple, by hooks of copper, weighing each a talent. (Haydock)

                           Six months are neglected, (see chap. ii. 11.) and as many are redundant, chap. vii. 1. Odd numbers are often treated in this
                           manner. (Calmet) --- It is wonderful that Solomon could complete this most stupendous structure (Haydock) in so short a time.
                           All Asia was 200 years in building the temple of Diana, at Ephesus, and 400 more in embellishing it. (Pliny, [Natural History?]
                           xxxvi. 12.) --- It is reported that 360,000 men were employed for twenty years, to build a pyramid of Egypt; (Calmet) which
                           was designed, perhaps for no other purpose but to shew the pride and magnificence of the king while living, and to contain
                           his ashes after death. Many of the materials for the temple had indeed been collected by David, (1 Paralipomenon xxii.) so
                           that Solomon was enabled to finish it in a much shorter time than his own palace, which took him almost <i>thirteen years</i>
                           to bring <i>to perfection.</i> They were almost contiguous to each other, though built on separate hills. The temple occupied
                           the whole of Moria, which was levelled a great deal, to allow space sufficient for such an amazing structure. It was thus
                           founded upon a rock, as an emblem of the perpetuity of the true religion, which has subsisted from the beginning of the world:
                           as may be seen at large in Dr. Worthington; who, on this occasion, gives a retrospective view of what had taken place in the
                           Jewish state, with respect to this most important subject, during the fourth age, or for the space of the last 480 years.
                           See Douay Bible, p. 701, &amp;c. We may be dispensed from repeating these things after him, as they are already, for the most
                           part, observed in the notes; where the attentive reader cannot fail to remark, that the law of the Old Testament was only
                           a figure of that which all must now embrace. <i>I am not come to destroy,</i> (the law or the prophets) says our Saviour,
                           (Matthew v. 17.) <i>but to fulfil,</i> by accomplishing all the figures and predictions, and by perfecting all that was imperfect,
                           though suitable for the state of mortals in former ages. Children cannot rationally be required to attain, at once, the perfection
                           of manhood. The painter first marks the outlines, which the colouring is calculated to efface, yet so as to render the picture
                           more beautiful. "The cunning Jew" would therefore, in vain, allege the greater antiquity of his religion, as it prefigured
                           and foretold the <i>author and finisher of our faith.</i> And Protestants will act very childishly if they suppose, with Mr.
                           Slack, a Methodist preacher, at Whitby, that this can in any degree enervate the argument of Catholics, who always arraign
                           them before the tribunal of the apostolic ages, in which they confess our bishops, <i>Linus,</i> &amp;c., existed, and were
                           ordained by the apostles themselves. "Setting aside the apostles, Linus, agreeably to the common opinion, was the first bishop
                           of the Roman see, who was ordained before the martyrdom both of Peter and Paul." Campbell, 12 lect., quoted by Mr. Slack;
                           (p. 63) who says that he was the first pope, and of course, that our religion mounts up to the age of the apostles; and, if
                           he thinks to evade this difficulty, by saying, that the Jewish religion was more ancient still, and yet rejected, we may desire
                           him to point out where the Scripture mentions that the religion of Christ was to be rendered more perfect than he left it;
                           as we know from that source, that he was to establish a new law, founded on <i>better promises</i> than those which had been
                           made to the Jew? How will this state of fluctuation, and this relapsing into abominable errors and idolatry, for many hundred
                           years, accord with the promises of Christ? (Matthew xxviii., &amp;c.) (Haydock) --- <i>Building it.</i> The dedication was
                           deferred till the following year, probably on account of the jubilee recurring at that time. (Usher, the year of the world
                           3000.) (Calmet) --- But this is very uncertain. Salien fixes upon the year 3030, which was not a year of jubilee; and he rather
                           thinks that the delay was occasioned by the vessels, the brazen sea, &amp;c., which had to be brought from the other side
                           of the Jordan. We may also recollect, that the rainy season was set in before the temple was quite finished; so that it would
                           have been very inconvenient for all Israel to assemble at that time. After the dedication, the temple continued to be adorned,
                           till it was destroyed by Nebuchadonoser, (Haydock) in the year 3416, and lay in ruins fifty-two years, when the Jews were
                           authorized by Cyrus to rebuild it. They could not however finish the work, so as to proceed to a fresh dedication, till the
                           reign of Darius Hystaspes, in the year 3489. Herod undertook to rebuild (Button) the greatest part of this second temple,
                           and to adorn it, in the most magnificent manner, in the year 3986. This place was honoured by the presence of the Son of God,
                           who foretold the destruction, which took place within that <i>generation,</i> [in] A.D. 70. (Haydock)</font></p><font size="2"
