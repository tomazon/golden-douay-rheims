                           Festus having arrived at his province, goes to Jerusalem to be inaugurated. The Jews took this opportunity of requesting St.
                           Paul might be sent to Jerusalem, that they might accomplish the iniquitous purport of their vow. Such consequence did they
                           attribute to the death of this one man, that they had no greater favour to ask of their new governor at his auspicious entry
                           among them. (Tirinus)</FONT></DIV><B>

                           appear, from their first request being peremptorily denied them, how little solicitous their governors were to please them.
                           The successors of Felix and Festus were not better disposed than their predecessors. Their extortions and oppressions were
                           pushed so far, that the Jews attempted at last to deliver themselves by rebellion, which proved their utter ruin and extirpation.
                           Indeed it was in vain to resist, for they already began to feel the truth of our Saviour's prediction, in their subjugation
                           to the Gentiles. Josephus bears ample testimony to the fulfilment of the prophecy. (The Jewish War, lib. ii. chap 16. &amp;c.)

                           Paul, seeing Festus only sought a plea to get rid of his cause, by putting it into the hands of the Sanhedrim, appeals to
                           Cæsar. According to the ordinary rules of jurisprudence, appeals are only made after sentence is pronounced; but Roman citizens
                           had a privilege of anticipating the sentence, when the judge did any thing contrary to justice; as Festus evidently did in
                           this case, by wishing to deliver Paul, a Roman citizen, to the tribunal of his declared enemies, the Jews. The apostle knew
                           he was secured by making this appeal: as the Roman law declared provincial governors violators of the public peace, who should
                           either strike, or imprison, or put to death a Roman citizen, that appealed to the emperor. (Calmet) --- Hence Pliny sent some
                           Christians to Rome for this same reason, as he writes himself in his epistles. (Lib. x. ep. 97.) Fuerunt alii similis amentiæ,

                           has the same curiosity of hearing Paul, as Herod formerly had of seeing Jesus. The apostle's name had, no doubt, become famous
                           enough to reach the ears, and arrest the attention of Agrippa. Curiosity is certainly not the best motive a person can bring
                           with him to&nbsp;the investigation of religious truth: still it may occasionally become productive of good. The king was half
                           persuaded to embrace the Christian faith. A better motive, or more serious attention, may induce some to embrace the truth,
                           which accident may first have discovered to them. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           my lord.</I> This was a title the emperors afterwards took, but which Augustus and Tiberius are said by Pliny, in his epistle
                           to Trajan, and by Tertullian, to have refused, as too assuming and too high, ut nimis sublimem atque gloriosum. This was perhaps
                           done, that none might bear the title at a time when the Lord of lords was to appear on the earth. (Tirinus) --- Whilst we
                           can approve and admire the motives which actuated the emperors in refusing this title, we cannot go the lengths which some
                           modern enthusiasts do, (mostly Americans, Quakers, &amp;c.) who pretend it is <I>blasphemy</I> to call a mortal man a <I>lord,</I>
                           as if that name were incommunicable to any but the Creator of the universe. Whence they derive this article of faith it will
                           not be easy for us to guess; certainly not from Scripture, in which the word Dominus or Lord, applied to man, occurs almost
                           as frequently as King. Certainly not from our Saviour's words, who give both himself and others this title, (Mark xiv. 14.
                           and other places.) nor from St. Paul's doctrine, who also uses this word indiscriminately through his epistles, Galatians
                           iv. 1; Ephesians vi. v.; &amp;c. Hence we are justified in retaining this practice, in opposition to their cavils; and in
                           treating that opinion as superstitious and void of foundation, which makes it a necessary part of religion to use no titles.

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 Let them, therefore, saith he, among you that are able, going down
                                    with <i>me</i>,&nbsp;accuse him, if there be any crime in the man.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And having remained among them no more than eight or ten days, he went
                                    down to Cæsarea, and the next day he sat in the judgment-seat: and commanded Paul to be brought.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And when he was brought, the Jews that were come down from Jerusalem,
                                    stood about him, objecting many and grievous accusations, which they could not prove:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 Paul making answer; That neither against the law of the Jews, nor against
                                    the temple, nor against Cæsar, have I offended in any thing.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 But Festus being willing to gratify the Jews, answered Paul, and said:
                                    Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 Then Paul said; I stand at Cæsar's tribunal where I ought to be judged:
                                    To the Jews I have done no injury, as thou very well knowest.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 For if I have injured them, or have committed any thing that deserveth
                                    death, I refuse not to die: but if there be nothing of these things whereof they accuse me, no man can deliver me to them.
                                    I appeal to Cæsar.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 Then Festus having conferred with the council, answered: Hast thou
                                    appealed to Cæsar? To Cæsar thou shalt go.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And after some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came down to Cæsarea,
                                    to salute Festus.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And as they stayed there many days, Festus told the king of Paul,
                                    saying; There is a certain man was left prisoner by Felix,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Concerning whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests, and the
                                    ancients of the Jews, came to me, desiring judgment against him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 To whom I answered: It is not the custom of the Romans to condemn
                                    any man, before that he who is accused have his accusers present, and have liberty of making his defence, to clear himself
                                    of the things laid to his charge.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 When, therefore, they came hither, without any delay, on the day following,
                                    sitting on the judgment-seat, I commanded the man to be brought forth.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no cause wherein
                                    I suspected evil:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 But had certain questions of their own superstition against him, and
                                    of one Jesus deceased, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And as I was in doubt of this manner of question, I asked him whether
                                    he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of those things.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 But Paul appealing to be reserved to the hearing of Augustus, I commanded
                                    him to be kept, till I might send him to Cæsar.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 Then Agrippa said to Festus: I would also hear the man myself. To-morrow,
                                    said he, thou shalt hear him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And on the next day, when Agrippa, and Bernice were come with great
                                    pomp, and had entered into the hall of audience, with the tribunes and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus,
                                    Paul was brought forth.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And Festus saith: King Agrippa, and all ye men who are here present
                                    with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews solicited me at Jerusalem, petitioning and crying out
                                    that he ought not to live any longer.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 Yet have I found nothing that he hath committed worthy of death. But
                                    he himself appealing to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 Of whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord. Wherefore I have
                                    brought him forth before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that examination being made, I may have something
                                    to write.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable, to send a prisoner, and not to
                                    signify the things laid to his charge.</font></p>
