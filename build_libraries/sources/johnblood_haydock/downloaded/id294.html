                           before the altar, having a golden censer</I>. In the visions is an allusion to the tabernacle and its parts. The altar of
                           perfumes was in the sanctum[the holy place], hard by the entrance into the sanctum sanctorum[the holy of holies], and here
                           the golden altar is said to be before the throne of God. The incense from the censer is said to be the prayers of all the
                           Saints, which the Angel offered up. The altar seems to signify our Saviour Christ, as the prayers of all the faithful are
                           always made through the merits of Christ, our only chief Mediator or Redeemer. By the fire cast upon the earth, (ver. 5.)
                           is signified the fire of divine charity, now to be exercised by the ways of justice, to draw persons to their conversion by
                           punishments. (Witham) --- We may observe both in this and other places of the Apocalypse, that St. John makes continual allusions
                           to what was done in the temple of Jerusalem, for which he gives us symbolical reasons. Thus on the present occasion, the incense
                           which was offered morning and evening in the temple, on the golden altar, is represented as done here in heaven. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           first Angel sounded,</I> &amp;c. From this place to the eleventh verse of chapter xx. the visions are differently expounded.
                           Some interpret them, without applying them to any particular events, as general comminations, in a mystical and allegorical
                           sense of the many persecutions which God permits to happen to his Church. Others think that they are all predictions, which
                           shall not happen till a little time before the end of the world, in antichrist's time, after which will follow the day of
                           the general judgment, the punishment of the wicked, and the reward of the just. But there are others, both ancient and later
                           writers, as in particular Alcazar, the bishop of Meaux (Bossuet,) Pere Alleman, to whom we may add among the Protestants,
                           Dr. Hammond, whom the bishop of Meaux calls the most learned of all the English Protestants. According to the interpretations
                           which these writers have followed, these predictions of St. John (except the last persecution, when the devil shall be let
                           loose, Chap. xx. 7, in the time of the great antichrist) have already happened in the three first ages[centuries], during
                           the persecutions of the heathen emperors, as I shall briefly take notice. <I>Hail</I> therefore, and <I>fire, blood, falling
                           of stars,</I> &amp;c. some look upon as mystical representations, to signify that a great many trials and persecutions shall
                           happen to the good, and a great many punishments and chastisements shall fall upon the wicked; with this grand difference,
                           that the sufferings of the good shall be short and momentary, and their reward a crown of endless glory; but the wicked, if
                           any of them escape punishments in this world, can never escape eternal torments with the devils in the next. <STRONG>2.</STRONG>
                           It is also a very common opinion, that all these disasters shall happen in a great measure, literally about antichrist's time,
                           a very short time before the end of the world. <STRONG>3.</STRONG> Others apply all these events to the judgments which God's
                           justice exercised either upon the Jews, in the time of Trajan and Adrian, or upon the heathen Roman emperors, and upon the
                           pagan city of Rome, for persecuting the servants of God. (Witham) --- As these Angels with their trumpets, according to Pastorini,
                           denote the sufferings of the Church during the seven ages that it lasts, it may not be improper to point out the time, according
                           to his opinion, when each Angel sounded the trumpet. Thus the first trumpet denotes the persecutions of the first three centuries,
                           in which the Christians suffered death by the sword, (denoted by blood) by being stoned, (denoted by the hail) and by fire,
                           when the third part of the trees were burnt, that is, the third part of the clergy were destroyed. (Pastorini) </FONT></P><B>

                           time pretended to be the true Messias of the Jews; his name also signifying a star. He was the chief cause of those wars,
                           and of the utter destruction of the Jews. (Witham) --- The third trumpet points out to us the punishment that falls upon the
                           Roman empire, in its destruction by the northern nations. These people spread themselves over the third part of the rivers
                           and provinces of ancient Rome. The star is called wormwood, from the bitter calamities and miseries which they inflicted upon

                           (Witham) --- Here we behold a noble figure of the Church, which whilst in its most flourishing state, like the sun, is suddenly
                           obscured, and a third part extinguished by the heresy and schism of the Greeks, under Photius, which began in 866[A.D. 866],
                           and infected all orders of Christians, clergy and laity, princes and individuals, signified by the sun, moon, and stars. (Pastorini)
