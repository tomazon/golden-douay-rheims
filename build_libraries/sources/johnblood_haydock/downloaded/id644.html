                           Genesis xxxii. 2. (Haydock) --- Abner was aware that he should not retain his authority under David, and therefore conducted
                           Isboseth to the camps in various places, (Menochius) but chiefly on the east side of the Jordan, (Haydock; ver. 29.) where
                           the people were particularly attached to Saul's family. Isboseth seems to have been a fit tool for his purpose.</FONT></P><B>

                           There was one south of Juda: but this country was probably near Hermon, and might be tributary to Israel. David perhaps married
                           this king's daughter, in order to detach him from the party of Isboseth, chap. iii. 3. Hebrew reads, "Assuri;" and St. Jerome
                           observes, that many explained it of the tribe of Aser, (Trad. Heb.[Hebrew tradition?]) with the Chaldee, (Du Hamel; Menochius)

                           which is by no means probable. Two years elapsed before the two houses came to an open war; (Salien) soon after which, the
                           power of Isboseth was greatly weakened by the defeat, and afterwards by the defection, of Abner. (Haydock) --- Hence the sacred

                           But there is no mention that Abner and Joab had authority to agree that these champions should decide the fate of the two
                           kingdoms, (Haydock) whence they are generally accused of ostentation; though the soldiers, not being acquainted with their
