                           <i>Psalm.</i> Protestants intimate that this was not in the Hebrew; but we find <i>mizmor,</i> "canticle," which is equivalent.
                           (Haydock) --- David speaks of his own restoration to health as a figure of Jesus Christ, who is principally intended, Hebrews
                           x. 7. The end of the psalm is nearly the same with the 69th. (Calmet) --- Some arbitrarily (Berthier) explain the words with
                           relation to the revolt of Absalom. (Bossuet) --- Others think it may refer to the captives, (Ven. Bede) to Daniel, or Jeremias,
                           rescued from prison. See Theodoret, who explains it of men waiting for the general resurrection. It may express the sentiments
                           of the Church, when the persecutions ceased. (Euthymius) --- Christ sometimes speaks in his own name, and sometimes in that
                           of his members. (St. Ambrose; St. Augustine) (Calmet) --- It is certain that David had Christ in view; and if he alludes to
                           himself, it is only as the figure of him. (Berthier)</font></p><b>

                           (Calmet) --- <i>Song.</i> Hebrew, "Praise." The penitent changes his language, which is no longer understood by worldlings.
                           (Berthier) --- <i>Many.</i> St. Augustine reads, <i>the just,</i> who take part in the welfare of their brethren, (Psalm xxxi.
                           11.) while the wicked are filled with alarm, at the ways of God; who humbles or exalts people as he pleases. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Thoughts,</i> or designs, "over us," as Hebrew adds. No one can fathom the counsels of the Lord. It is folly, therefore,
                           to attack his mysteries. (Haydock) --- <i>Like.</i> Protestants, "and thy thoughts <i>which are </i>to usward, they cannot
                           be reckoned up in order unto thee." Literally, <i>non ordinare apud te.</i> (Montanus) (Haydock) --- But <i>haroc</i> means
                           also <i>æquiparare,</i> which corresponds with the Vulgate. (Berthier) --- Syriac, "none is comparable to thee." (Calmet)
                           --- <i>Number.</i> Christ and his apostles preached, so that many followed their doctrine. (Worthington) --- David also had
                           many witnesses of his gratitude. They crowded round him. Some would improperly make <i>multiplicati sunt,</i> agree with <i>mirabilia,
                           <u>dialogismois</u>,</i> which is in the masculine. (Berthier) --- "I find no order before thee; if I would declare and number,
                           they are more (<i>wonders</i>) than can be counted." (St. Jerome) (Haydock) --- I am at a loss how to express myself, and
                           must be content with the interior sentiments of gratitude. See Psalm lxx. 15. (Calmet)</font></p>

                           <i>Sacrifice and oblation.</i> Neither bloody nor unbloody sacrifices of the law will do. (Menochius) --- <i>Pierced ears.</i>
                           Septuagint and St. Paul read, <i>a body thou hast fitted to me,</i> Hebrews x. 5. (Haydock) --- Nobilius mentions, that he
                           found the reading of the Vulgate in one Greek manuscript in Eusebius, &amp;c. --- The Arabic has both. "Thou hast prepared
                           a body for me, and opened my ears." (Calmet) --- Both are, in effect, of divine authority. The version adopted by St. Paul,
                           cannot be rejected, no more than the Hebrew confirmed by the Vulgate. James Pierce asserts, that the Hebrew is incorrect,
                           <i>oznaim</i> being put for <i>az zip,</i> "then a body," as the letters are not unlike. The dissertation is ingenious: the
                           author is, however, suspected of Socinianism. We know not the reason why the Vulgate here abandons the Septuagint. The sense
                           is much the same; the prophet noticing the entire obedience of the Messias, (Berthier) and the apostle comprising his whole
                           person. (Menochius) --- His body was miraculous, (Haydock) and the incarnation the work of God. (Calmet) --- Nothing could
                           come up to his submission. "Thou has dug ears for me," (St. Jerome; Haydock) alluding to the custom of making slaves for ever,
                           (Exodus xxi. 5.) or "thou hast fitted, (Calmet) opened, (Protestants) my ears," enabling me to hear, and to obey. (Haydock)
                           --- The sacrifice of Christ was never interrupted, from the first moment of his incarnation. (Calmet) --- He was always doing
                           the will of his Father. (Haydock) --- This sacrifice is the most essential. God rejected all such as were destitute of this
                           condition, or were not offered by people determined to observe the whole law, 1 Kings xv. 22., Isaias i. 11., and Jeremias
                           vii. 22. (Porphyrius, Abs. ii.) (Calmet) --- No sacrifice of the Old Testament was sufficient to satisfy God's justice for
                           sin. Christ, by the <i>ear</i> of obedience, performed the redemption of man by his death, as was determined from eternity.
                           See Hebrews x. (Worthington) --- <i>And</i> is omitted in the Latin version of St. Paul, <i>holocautomata pro peccato,</i>
                           inadvertently, or rather to intimate, that he was speaking of the holocaust of expiation, Hebrews x. 6, 8., and xiii. 11.,
                           and Leviticus xvi. 27. (Berthier) --- St. Augustine also admits only one species of sacrifice, "holocausts likewise for sin."
                           But others distinguish them from the victims designed to expiate the sins of individuals, (Leviticus v., &amp;c.) of which
                           the prophet also speaks. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           book of Psalms, (St. Augustine) or rather in the whole Bible. (Calmet) --- <i>Kephalis</i> denotes a volume, (Suidas) or stick,
                           on which books were formerly rolled, being written on parchment. The Jews still observe the same custom in their synagogues.
                           (Calmet) (Luke iv. 17, 20.) --- Hebrew, "In the volume of the book," means, in the book, (Amama) or the Bible, which is <i>the
                           book</i> by excellence, where the incarnation and death of Christ, for man's redemption, are clearly specified. (Haydock)
                           --- This is the <i>sum</i> of the Scriptures. (Worthington) --- <i>They bear witness</i> to Christ, John v. 39., and Luke
                           xxiv. 27. (Haydock) --- The apostle uses the word <i>capitulum,</i> for the sum, Hebrews viii. Whatever sense be chosen, we
                           should meditate on this <i>head,</i> or volume. But Christ signed, as it were, this solemn engagement, from all eternity.
                           If we adopt the passage to David, we may translate, "I come, having on me the volume of thy Scriptures." See 4 Kings xi. 12.

                           be saved but by his grace. He has announced these things, and then he finishes his career, by suffering for us, and pours
                           forth his supplications to God. (Berthier)</font></p><b>

                                    <P>1 Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.</P>
                                    <P>2 With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive to me.</P>
                                    <P>3 And he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs.</P>
                                    <P>And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my steps.</P>
                                    <P>4 And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God.</P>
                                    <P>Many shall see, and shall fear: and they shall hope in the Lord.</P>
                                    <P>5 Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord: and who hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies.</P>
                                    <P>6 Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord, my God: and in thy thoughts there is not one like to thee.</P>
                                    <P>I have declared and I have spoken: they are multiplied above number.</P>
                                    <P>7 *Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; but thou hast pierced ears for me.</P>
                                    <P>Burnt-offering and sin-offering thou didst not require: 8 then said I, Behold I come.</P>
                                    <P>In the head of the book it is written of me, 9 that I should do thy will: O my God, I have desired <I>it</I>, and thy law
                                    in the midst of my heart.</P>
                                    <P>10 I have declared thy justice in a great church; lo, I will not restrain my lips: O Lord, thou knowest it.</P>
                                    <P>11 I have not hid thy justice within my heart: I have declared thy truth, and thy salvation.</P>
                                    <P>I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth from a great council.</P>
                                    <P>12 Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me; thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me.</P>
                                    <P>13 For evils without number have surrounded me; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see.</P>
                                    <P>They are multiplied above the hairs of my head: and my heart hath forsaken me.</P>
                                    <P>14 Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: *look down, O Lord, to help me.</P>
                                    <P>15 *Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek after my soul to take it away.</P>
                                    <P>Let them be turned backward, and be ashamed, that desire evils to me.</P>
                                    <P>16 Let them immediately bear their confusion, that say to me: 'Tis well, 'tis well.</P>
                                    <P>17 Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.</P>
                                    <P>18 But I am a beggar and poor; the Lord is careful for me.</P>
                                    <P>Thou art my helper and my protector: O my God, be not slack.</P></FONT></FONT>
