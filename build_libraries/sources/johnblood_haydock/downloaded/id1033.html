                           with ignominy, but the impenitent shall suffer eternal torments. These worms and fires do not cease. They are not merely figurative,
                           but real, according to the Fathers. (Serarius, q. 1.) (Tirinus) (Essais de Mor.) --- Though the damned have not yet their
                           bodies, they are no less affected with pain; as people who have lost a member, often seem to feel pain in it. That our soul
                           should even now suffer, when the body is hurt, depends on God's appointment. The Jews spoke of eternal torments in similar
                           terms, Ecclesiasticus vii. 19., Isaias lxvi. 24., and Mark ix. 45.</font></p><b>

                           <i>Years.</i> Greek, "days." See the preface. (Haydock) --- Judith was a widow near seventy years, shewing an excellent pattern
                           to all in that state. Notwithstanding the many inducements which she might have had to marry again, she chose to abstain,
                           for greater perfection, Matthew xix., and 1 Corinthians vii. (Worthington) --- From the death of Holofernes (the year of the
                           world 3348) to that of Josias, (the year 3394) only forty-six years of peace would occur in Juda. Hence Hardouin would suppose
                           that the text speaks of the kingdom of <i>Israel.</i> But it would be hard to prove that it existed at that time, after the
                           ten tribes had been led away. (The year 3283.) As the Scripture does not specify how old Judith was when she addressed Holofernes,
                           (Calmet) she might be sixty-five. (Vitre.) --- If, therefore, we should make this peace last till the coming of Nabuchodonosor,
                           to attack Jerusalem, about forty-six years might elapse before the period here assigned. (Calmet) --- It is, however, much
                           more probable, (Haydock) that the peace subsisted from the 11th of Manasses to the death of Josias, 73 (Greek, 78) years;
                           (Tirinus) and that she was not above forty when she performed her exploit; as she was then styled a beautiful girl, (chap.
                           xii. 12.) and many desired to marry her. (Haydock) --- No instance can be produced, of the Jews entering into such contracts
                           with those who were past child-bearing. Freret, who seems afraid to allow this book the same authority as the additions to
                           Daniel, though both are equally rejected by Protestants, supposes that Bethulia was besieged in the 11th or 12th year of Josias;
                           and, of course, that Judith would then be about eighty-four years old! (Houbigant)</font></p><b>

                           <i>But.</i> This is taken from the Chaldean of St. Jerome, though omitted in the old Vulgate, as well as in the Greek and
                           Syriac. We find no express mention of this festival in the Jews' Calendar, (Calmet) though no one can doubt but it once was
                           kept. (Du Hamel) --- It probably ceased during the captivity; as that, in memory of the victory over Nicanor, (which was kept
                           in the days of Josephus, [Antiquities?] xii. 16.) has been long since abolished, (Calmet) with many others. (Du Hamel) ---
                           Many suppose (Calmet) that the feast of Judith concurred with that of the new fire, when the temple was renewed under Judas
                           the Machabee, on the 25th of Casleu, (Salien, &amp;c.) in December, though the victory of Judith was obtained about August.
                           The point is not easily decided. As the festival was of human institution, it might be abrogated by the same authority. (Calmet)
                           --- In Judith we behold a <i>widow indeed,</i> such as the apostle commends, 1 Timothy v. 3. (St. Jerome ad Furiam.) --- We
                           may also raise our minds still higher, and contemplate in her a glorious figure of the Christian Church, which is spotless;
                           and by the practice of all virtues, overcomes the power of persecutors, giving all the glory to God. After victory, she continues
                           in silence to practise her former austerities, which render her secure in peace and terrible in war. (Calmet)</font></p><font
