                           ancients, therefore, that are among you, I beseech, who am myself also an ancient,</I>[1] &amp;c. According to the letter,
                           <I>the senior, I, a fellow senior;</I> or, <I>the elder, I, a fellow elder.</I> Mr. Nary, and also the French translators,
                           commonly put, <I>the priest, I, your fellow priest.</I> Or even it might be, <I>the bishops, I, your fellow bishop.</I> The
                           Latin word, <I>senior,</I> and the Greek word <I>presbyteros,</I> which here are in the text, if we should follow their derivation
                           only, signify <I>elderly men,</I> or men advanced in years; but since by a received use, they signify and represent to us
                           offices and dignities, either ecclesiastical or civil, either belonging to the Church or state, which in other languages are
                           now generally known by other words, we may however be permitted to use, even in translating the holy Scriptures, those words
                           and names by which now are represented to us those offices and dignities. It cannot be doubted but the Greek and Latin words,
                           which we find in this verse, were applied, after the establishment of the new law of Christ, to signify such ministers of
                           God and the Church which are now called priests and bishops: and it is for this reason that I judged it better to put the
                           word <I>priest,</I> and <I>fellow priest,</I> (meaning priests of the higher order, commonly known by the name of bishops)
                           than to use the words <I>seniors, elders,</I> or <I>presbyters.</I> I should not blame the Protestant translators for translating
                           always the Greek word, <I>presbyter,</I> by the English word <I>elder,</I> nor the Rhemes translators for putting it here
                           <I>senior,</I> if these words were sufficiently authorised by an ecclesiastical use and custom to signify priests or bishops;
                           which I think can scarce be said, to say nothing that the word <I>elders</I> hath been used by fanatical men, who admit of
                           no ordination of bishops or priests by divine institution, and who have affixed it to their <I>lay elders,</I> who are appointed
                           and degraded as it seemeth good to their congregations. Though the Protestants of the Church of England always translate <I>elders
                           </I>for <I>presbyters</I> in the New Testament, yet I do not find this word once used in their liturgy or common prayer book,
                           when any directions are given to those that perform the church office, who are called priests, bishops, curates, or ministers.
                           --- <I>And a witness of the sufferings of Christ.</I> St. Peter being called and made the first or chief of the apostles soon
                           after Christ began to preach, he was witness of what Christ suffered, both during the time of his preaching and of his passion.
                           --- <I>Glory.</I> Some think that St. Peter only means, that he was present at his transfiguration, where was shewn some resemblance
                           of the glory which is to come in heaven. Others think, that he expresseth the firm hopes he had of enjoying the glory of heaven.

                           It is certain that in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and in other languages, such as have a superiority and command over others, in
                           the Church or in the commonwealth, have been called by words that by their derivation express men advanced in age and years;
                           because men chosen to such offices were commonly, though not always, advanced in age. Yet whether old or young, we give them
                           the names which use and custom hath affixed to their dignities; for example, in English, the chief magistrate of a town we
                           call the <I>mayor</I> or <I>major,</I> not the <I>greater</I> of such a town; those who rule with him, we call the <I>aldermen,</I>
                           not the <I>elderly men</I> according to the derivation. The like might be said of <I>senate, senators,</I> and many other
                           names of offices and dignities; and, as the authors of the annotations on the Rheims Testament observed, it would be ridiculous
                           to translate such words according to their <I>etymologies.</I> We must not translate <I>pontifex,</I> a <I>bridge-maker; lapis,</I>
                           a <I>hurt foot,</I> &amp;c.&nbsp;<I><U>Apostolos</U>,</I> by its derivation, signifieth only <I>one sent,</I> or <I>a messenger;</I>&nbsp;<I><U>episkopos</U>,</I>
                           an <I>overseer,</I> or <I>inspector;&nbsp;<U>diakonos</U>,</I> a <I>servant,</I> or <I>waiter;</I> yet Protestants as well
                           as Catholics translate, <I>apostles, bishops, deacons;</I> and where&nbsp;<I><U>presbuteroi</U>,</I> or seniors, signify men
                           now known by these words, priests or bishops, why may we not in translating give them these names? It is true a particular
                           difficulty occurs, because (as St. Jerome, St. Chrysostom, and others have taken notice) the Greek word,&nbsp;<I><U>o presbuteros</U>,</I>
                           is used in the New Testament sometimes for those who by their dignity were <I>priests</I> only, sometimes for <I>bishops,</I>
                           and many times in the gospels for those who were governors among the Jews, or members of their great council or sanhedrim
                           and sometimes only for those who by their age were elder or more advanced in years. This makes it impossible, in translating,
                           to represent the signification of this Greek word always in Latin or in English by the same Latin or English word, which a
                           translator should endeavour to do as much as possible. The Protestant translators have indeed always rendered the Greek <I>presbuteros</I>
                           by the English word <I>elder;</I> they adhere to the derivation of the word without regard to the different offices signified
                           by that one word, and for which we have different words in English. I take notice that the Latin interpreter of the old Vulgate,
                           though generally very exact, has not followed this rule of translating&nbsp;<I><U>presbuteros</U></I> by the same Latin word:
                           for example, Acts xv. 2. he puts <I>presbyteros,</I> and yet in the same chapter (ver. 4, 6, 22, and 23) he puts <I>seniores.</I>
                           Acts xx. 17. for&nbsp;<I><U>presbuterous</U></I> he puts <I>majores natu;</I> and these same persons, by the 28th verse, are
                           called <I>episcopi,&nbsp;<U>episkopoi</U>.</I> In the epistle to Timothy and Titus, as also in those of Sts. James, Peter,
                           and John, for the same Greek word we sometimes find <I>presbyteri,</I> and sometimes <I>seniores.</I> A late English translation
                           from the Latin, (in the year 1719. by C. N.) for seniores and presbyteri sometimes puts <I>elders,</I> sometimes <I>priests,</I>
                           whether it be seniores or presbyteri in the Latin; and when mention is made of the ministers of the gospel, (as Acts xv. 4.)
                           for <I>seniores</I> he translates <I>elders,</I> and yet in the same chapter (ver. 6, 22, and 23) for the same word he puts
                           <I>priests,</I> &amp;c. The translators of the Rheims Testament were more exact, for generally speaking of <I>seniores</I>
                           they put <I>the ancients,</I> when mention was made of those who were&nbsp;<I><U>presbuteroi</U></I> among the Jews; when
                           <I>seniores</I> were applied to the ministers of the gospel, they put <I>seniors;</I> and for <I>presbyteri,</I> they translate

                           they put to the <I>ancients;</I> and also, in Acts xvi. 4., for <I>senioribus</I> we again find <I>ancients.</I> For my part
                           I judged it best, for distinction sake, to put <I>elders</I> in the gospels for <I>seniores,</I> or&nbsp;<I><U>presbuteroi</U></I>
                           of the Jews. I had put in the Acts of the Apostles <I>seniors</I> where I found <I>seniores,</I> speaking of the ministers
                           of the new law; and where I have found the Latin, <I>presbyteri,</I> I have translated <I>priests;</I> and Acts xx. 17. I
                           have translated the <I>seniors.</I> I have also been in a doubt here in this place of St. Peter, and also in the 2nd and 3rd
                           of St. John, whether to put seniors or priests: I have put <I>ancient priests,</I> not doubting but that St. Peter and St.
                           John speak of themselves as priests of the first order, or as they were bishops.</FONT></P>
