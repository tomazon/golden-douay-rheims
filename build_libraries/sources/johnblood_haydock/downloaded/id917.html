                           destroying the high places which had been unlawfully (Calmet) retained, as consecrated to the true God. See ver. 22. (Haydock)

                           respect. When any relic or image becomes the occasion of abuse in the Catholic Church, it is thus taken away, or the error
                           is otherwise corrected. See St. Augustine, City of God x. 8., Ser. 14., de Verb. Ap., &amp;c. (Worthington) --- Some of the
                           ancients assert, that Ezechias suppressed many books of Solomon, on account of similar abuses. But this seems not to be well
                           attested. We know that he made a collection of some of some of his sentences, Proverbs xxv. 1.</font></p><b>

                           chap. xix. 34. These three are particularly commended, Ecclesiasticus xlix. 5. (Calmet) --- Their virtues were certainly different

                           <i>Sennacherib's</i> expedition in Egypt and Asia are mentioned by Herodotus (ii. 141.) and Berosus, (Josephus, [Antiquities?]
                           x. 1.) but they do not say that he passed farther then Pelusium, (Calmet) the frontier on the Egyptian side of Palestine.
                           (Haydock) --- These expeditions might have been performed in less than eight months, during the 14th year of Ezechias, who
                           fell sick, perhaps soon after the ruin of Sennacherib's army, chap. xx. 1. Isaias (x. 28.) represents the Assyrian proceeding
                           from Gabaa towards Egypt, and thence he <i>ascended</i> to attack the cities of Juda, (ver. 25.) Manresa, (Micheas i. 15.)
                           &amp;c. While he was before Lachis, Ezechias, dreading the horrors of war, purchased a peace: but the tyrant soon after sent
                           to require him to surrender at discretion; and in the mean time he went to besiege Lebna, where his envoys found him, having
                           received no answer from the king of Juda. The haughty Assyrian being obliged to go to meet the king of Chus, sent insolent
                           letters to Ezechias; but the latter was assured that all his menaces were to be despised, and on the same night that Sennacherib
                           left Lebna, the angel destroyed 185,000 of his men. It is thought that the siege of Lachis did not take place till three years
                           after Sennacherib had come into Palestine, and after he had spent that time in attacking Egypt, chap. xix. 24. (Josephus,
                           [Antiquities?] x. 2., and 3.) --- He attempted afterwards to take the southern cities of Juda, in order to cut off all communication
                           with Egypt; as Nabuchodonosor, Holofernes, and Eupator probably intended to do, Jeremias xxiv. 7., Judith vi., and vii., and
                           1 Machabees vi. 31. (Calmet) --- <i>Offended,</i> and been imprudent. (Menochius) --- <i>Gold,</i> so that the value of each
                           was equal. (Du Hamel) --- Josephus reads, "or thirty," as if that quantity of gold would suffice. (Haydock) --- The <i>talent</i>
                           contains 3000 sicles. (Menochius) --- The heart of Ezechias fainted at the approach of so great an army, though he had before
                           made the greatest preparations, chap. xx. 2., 2 Paralipomenon xxxii. 5., and Ecclesiasticus xlviii. 19. (Tirinus)</font></p><b>

                           were frequently adorned with the most precious metals, as Homer describes the palace of Alcinous; (Odyssey; <i><u>H</u></i>)
                           and Tavernier (vii. 12.) speaks of some mosques in Persia, the doors of which are covered with plates of silver. See Josephus,
