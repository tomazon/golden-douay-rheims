                           Tyre, who were the most potent princes in the neighbourhood. Eupolemus (ap. Eusebius, præp.) has a letter of Solomon to Pharao
                           Vaphres, in which the latter is said to have been the friend of David; (Salien) and St. Clement of Alexandria (Strom. i.)

                           <i>But yet.</i> It is not clear to what this refers. Hebrew, "for the rest, (Calmet) <i>or</i> only;" (as also ver. 3,) which
                           may signify that the people, and their king, were blamable; or else, that they zealously offered sacrifices to God, even before
                           the temple was erected. (Haydock) --- Those who afterwards left that sacred place, to imitate the conduct of idolaters, or
                           of the ancient patriarchs, which was no longer tolerated, are justly condemned. (Calmet) --- <i>High places.</i> That is,
                           altars where they worshipped the Lord, indeed, but not according to the ordinance of the law; which allowed of no other places
                           for sacrifice but the temple of God. Among these high places, that of Gabaon was the chief, because there was the tabernacle
                           of the testimony which had been removed from Silo to Nobe, and from Nobe to Gabaon. (Challoner) --- Hither David would have
                           gone, as Solomon did, ver. 4. (Calmet) --- Hence this was not, at least, once of those high places, where it was unlawful
                           to offer sacrifice; as the tabernacle was there, and the altar of holocausts, which Moses had erected. The obligation of sacrificing
                           in no place, except in that which the Lord had appointed, regarded the times while the ark was in the desert, (Haydock) and
                           when it was placed in the temple. While it continued in an unsettled state, people enjoyed more liberty in this respect; (Calmet)
                           particularly when there was a prophet present, to sanction what they did. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           art of governing, excelled that of any of the kings of Israel; (Lyranus, &amp;c.; 2 Paralipomenon ix.) though Moses and the
                           apostles had a more comprehensive knowledge of the mysteries of God. (Calmet) --- Yet, even granting that no mere man might

                                    of peace-offerings, and made a great feast for all his servants.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 Then there came two women that were harlots, to the king, and stood

                                    in one house, and I was delivered of a child with her in the chamber.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And the third day after that I was delivered, she also was delivered;
                                    and we were together, and no other person with us in the house; only we two.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And this woman's child died in the night: for in her sleep she overlaid

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And when I arose in the morning, to give my child suck, behold it
                                    was dead: but considering him more diligently, when it was clear day, I found that it was not mine which I bore.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And the other woman answered: It is not so as thou sayest, but thy
                                    child is dead, and mine is alive. On the contrary, she said; Thou liest: for my child liveth, and thy child is dead. And in
                                    this manner they strove before the king.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Then said the king: The one saith, My child is alive, and thy child

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 But the woman whose child was alive, said to the king; (for her bowels
                                    were moved upon her child) I beseech thee, my lord, give her the child alive, and do not kill it. But the other said: Let
                                    it be neither mine nor thine; but divide it.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 The king answered, and said: Give the living child to this woman,
