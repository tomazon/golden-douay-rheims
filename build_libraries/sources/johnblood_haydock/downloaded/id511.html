                           (<I>judicium</I>.) Moses only mentions a part, having explained the rest, Exodus xxix. 27., Leviticus vii. 32. --- <I>Breast,</I>

                           The cheeks or chaps are specified no where else; so that some think Moses here supplies what he had left imperfect, assigning
                           to the priests the cheeks and the tongue. Jansenius supposes that this is only a part of the breast, which appears to have
                           two cheeks when the shoulders are cut off. But Moses here probably speaks not of the peace-offerings, but of the beasts which
                           were killed by the Israelites at home for their own uses, &amp;c., (Clerc) as Philo explains it, (de præm.) and Josephus ([Antiquities?]
                           iv. 4) only specifies the right shoulder and the breast, which were given to the priests on these occasions. (Calmet) ---
                           Septuagint, "the shoulder, the cheeks, and the last ventricle." The victims were not, therefore, of a sacred nature; as they
                           were only sacrificed, inasmuch as the blood was to be offered to the Lord. (Haydock) See Genesis xliii. 16.</FONT></P><B>

                           In the days of Moses, all the Levites probably assisted in the service of the tabernacle, when they thought proper. But, after
                           they should be dispersed, he encourages them to come willingly. David afterwards divided the priests and the Levites into
                           classes, which were obliged to serve in their turns, 1 Paralipomenon xxiii., &amp;c. Though he derogated from the words of
                           the law, he followed the spirit of the injunction, which was intended to promote the great glory and decency of religion;
                           and even after this regulation, (Calmet) those who desired, like Samuel, (Menochius) to consecrate their labours to the Lord

                           This impiety is not punished with death, (Leviticus xviii. 21,) as the burning of children was, Leviticus xx. 2. (Grotius)
                           --- It was done in imitation of the latter, and became more common, as it was less cruel; the person who was thus expiated,
                           being to pass between or to jump over fire. The council of Trullo (canon 65,) was forced to condemn this remnant of an abominable
                           superstition. But the other inhuman worship of Moloc, and of other pagan divinities, was certainly very common, and chiefly
                           brought down destruction upon the people of Chanaan. See Jeremias xix. 5., Ezechiel xxiii. 37., Psalm cv. 37., and 4 Kings
                           xvii. 31. Ennius says, <I>Pæni sunt soliti suos sacrificare puellos.</I> See St. Augustine, City of God vii. 17.; St. Jerome

                           who set up for diviners, and those who consult them, are condemned. (Haydock) --- Hiscuni explains it of a superstitious practice,
                           by which a person measured a stick with his finger, saying first <I>I will go;</I> and then <I>I will not;</I> and if, when
                           he came to the end of the stick, he had to say <I>I will go,</I> he determined to begin his journey. See Ezechial xxi. 21.

                           with the devil generally deceive those who consult them. Septuagint, "a belly talker," as these impostors muttered some sounds,

                           This passage plainly proves, that the Scripture may have many literal senses: for the context insinuates that God would supply
                           the wants of his people, so that they should not need to go far in order to consult diviners, since they should have leaders
                           and prophets, after the death of Moses, who might explain to them God's will, as they had desired; but at the same time, it
                           clearly refers to the Messias, as it is explained by St. Peter, (Acts iii. 22.; Worthington) and by St. Stephen, Acts vii.
                           37. The Jews, at that time, were convinced of the truth of this application: but they only denied that Christ was the Messias.
                           They have since gone a step farther, and deny that it regards the Messias, some referring it to Josue, others to Jeremias,
                           &amp;c. (Ap. Munster and Fag.) But surely what other prophet could be compared with Moses? (Chap. xxxiv. 10.) What other man
                           reunited in his person the qualifications of lawgiver, chief of God's people, mediator, &amp;c., or who was <I>like</I> him?
                           Hence <I>prophet</I> is written in the singular, to denote his eminent dignity. (St. Augustine, contra Faustus) --- St. Philip
                           recognized the claim of Jesus, as did the people after the multiplication of bread, John i. 45., and vi. 14. God the Father
                           seems to allude to this passage, according to the remark of Tertullian, (contra Mar. iv. 22,) when he says <I>hear ye him,</I>
                           (Luke ix. 35,) as St. Cyprian believes our Saviour does also, John v. 46. St. Athanasius (contra Arianos 2) condemns the error
                           of the Jews, who would apply this passage to any other prophet but to the Messias. If they could be excused for denying him
                           this latter claim, they surely cannot in calling in question that Jesus was a true <I>prophet,</I> since he has all the marks
                           of one; (Grotius) and if they would once acknowledge this, they must soon confess that he is also the Messias, and the Son
                           of God, as these truths are so necessarily connected. (Calmet) --- The miracles of Moses were far exceeded by those of Jesus
                           Christ, and the latter conversed more intimately with his eternal Father, &amp;c. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>
