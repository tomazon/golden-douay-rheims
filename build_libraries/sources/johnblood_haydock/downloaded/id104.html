                           the end of the preceding chapter, we are told that Jesus went into the place where John the Baptist was first baptizing. This
                           place, as may be gather from St. John, (chap. i. ver. 28. and 44.) was Bethania; but not the Bethania where the sisters of
                           Lazarus resided. The Bethania where Christ was at this time was beyond the Jordan, and was likewise called Bethabara; whereas
                           the Bethania where Lazarus lay sick, was two miles to the south of Jerusalem, and formed a part of the suburbs of that city.
                           It is called the town of Martha and Mary, because they lived there; in the same manner as Bethsaida is called the city of
                           Peter and Andrew. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           were brought to the true faith, and thus avoided an eternal death. (St. Augustine, tract. 49. in Joan.) --- Lazarus indeed

                                    a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him.</font></p>
