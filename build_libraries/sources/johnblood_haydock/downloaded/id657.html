                           is not certain whether he had any other horsemen but those who mounted the chariots. Horses were then very scarce in Israel.

                           Absalom rises early for wickedness. He assumes the character of a most zealous and disinterested judge, as if to contrast
                           his conduct with the remissness of some appointed by the king; though the Holy Ghost bears witness to the integrity of David,

                           which Vatable dates from the time when the people petitioned for a king; Salien, from the first anointing of David. (Menochius)
                           --- It is probable enough that this number has been substituted instead of <I>four,</I> which Josephus, Theodoret, Syriac,
                           Arabic, and many Latin manuscripts read; and Absalom would employ this term in securing the interest of Israel, before he
                           declared himself openly their king. (Calmet) --- He had been so long at Jerusalem, since his return. (Salien) --- The canon
                           of Hebrew verity, supposed to be made about the ninth century, is said (by Martinnay; Haydock) to be altered by some correcting
                           hand, from four to forty. (Kennicott) --- This is the famous Memmian canon, which Theodulph, bishop of Orleans, is believed
                           to have ordered, as the standard of truth, according to the Hebrew copies of that day: (Haydock) and this seems to have guided
                           the Ben. editor of St. Jerome's works, and of his translation; so that it is no wonder if "the printed copies agree in so
                           many places with the corrupted Hebrew." <I>Canon Memmianus <I><FONT size=3>pur</FONT><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman"><FONT

                           2 Paralipomenon xiii. 3, 17.) The Vulgate of Sixtus V, in that passage, as well as in the present, reads the smaller numbers,
                           as he was guided by the best <I>Latin</I> copies, whereas Clement VIII has also consulted "the Hebrew fountains." The former,
                           says Kennicott, (Diss. ii. p. 205) "seems to have been printed on a juster plan....and the old Latin version is likely to
                           be found more pure in the edition of Sixtus than in that of Clement, since the latter seems to have corrected his Latin by
                           the modern (i.e., the corrupted) Hebrew copies." Dr. James observes, that "almost all the Latin editions received in the Church,
                           for many years, (preceding 1590) agree with Sixtus," who here reads <I>quatuor,</I> with many others; so that Grotius is well
                           supported in having pronounced so decisively, "without doubt there is a mistake, two letters having been added at the end
                           of <I><I><FONT size=3>arb</FONT><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">á</I></FONT></FONT>.</I>
                           The thing itself declares that <I>four</I> years had elapsed." (Kennicott) --- It appears to be indubitable, that some mistakes
                           have taken place with regard to numbers. But that this place is incorrect may not be so certain, as the chronology of Salien,
                           Usher, &amp;c., explains it well enough. The Hebrew text was esteemed more correct when the last editions of St. Jerome, and
                           of the Vulgate, were given, than it is at present. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           The pretext seemed very bad, since he ought not to have delayed so long to perform his vow. Moreover, the usual places for
                           sacrifice were Gabaon or Sion. But Absalom might plead a respect for the patriarchs, who were buried at Hebron. (St. Jerome,

                           are always desirous of novelty. David had lately been guilty of two scandalous crimes. Joab remained unpunished, and arrogant;

                           without bloodshed. He departs on foot, like a penitent, acknowledging the justice of God. Fear does not prompt him to leave
                           Jerusalem, which was a place of such strength, (chap. v. 6.) nor are his attendants abandoned on a sudden by that courage,
                           which made some of them a match for a whole army. David disposes of all things with great coolness and prudence. (Calmet)
