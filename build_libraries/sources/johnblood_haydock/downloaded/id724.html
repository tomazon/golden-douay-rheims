                           (Worthington) by the Romans. (St. Jerome; Theodoret; Eusebius, Dem. vi. 18.) (Calmet) --- Vespasian collected numerous forces.
                           (Josephus, Jewish Wars iii. 1.) --- Titus had six legions and many auxiliaries, Arabs, &amp;c. (Tacitus, Hist. v.) --- Various
                           nations composed their army. (Worthington) --- <i>Rifled,</i> or demolished. None was left standing. (Josephus, Jewish Wars
                           vii. 6.; Heges. v. 49.) --- St. Jerome and others think that the city on Sion was spared, (Calmet) and 40,000 were permitted
                           to dwell where they had a mind. (Josephus, Jewish Wars vii. 15.) --- But it is not said that they continued at Jerusalem.
                           Half the Jews therefore perished, and those who maintained the siege found a grave in the city. (Theodoret) --- <i>Half</i>
                           only denotes a considerable part, as [in] ver. 8. Those who followed our Saviour's admonition, retired before, and were safe

                           punish the victorious Romans. (Haydock) --- Now he fought with them as [the] Hebrew may signify. (Calmet) --- Various prodigies
                           made this clear: (Josephus, Jewish Wars vii. 12, 16.) so that Titus would not receive the crown which was presented to him,
                           as he looked upon himself only as the instrument employed by divine justice. (Philost. vi. 14.) --- This sense is given by
                           St. Cyril, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- In the days of Epiphanes, God defeated his projects. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           If it regard the latter times, this must be hidden. But it suffices that some great earthquake should take place, according
                           to most interpreters; or rather, (Calmet) the Romans removed vast quantities of earth and stone. (Josephus, Jewish Wars vi.
                           12.) (Grotius) --- Olivet has three tops; the southern one is the lowest. But whether this was caused by an earthquake we
                           know not. The rocks are said to split, &amp;c., when God displays his power and affords some miraculous assistance, Psalm

                           Septuagint, &amp;c., "and it shall be filled, as it was filled at the earthquake," &amp;c. (Calmet) --- The Romans had to
                           raise many works in the vale of Cedron, so that the trees all round were cut down, and the garden walls removed thither. (Josephus,
                           Jewish Wars vi. 4, 14.) --- <i>Ozias,</i> when he attempted to offer incense. (Josephus, Antiquities ix. 11.) (Amos i. 1.,
                           and 4 Kings xv. 15.) --- Yet the earthquake is not specified in the sacred historical books. (Worthington) --- On that occasion,
                           the people retired into the vale formed by the separation of Olivet; or, if we follow the Septuagint, part of that mountain
                           fell into the valley of Cedron, which we find nowhere else specified. (Calmet) --- <i>With him.</i> Protestants, "thee." (Haydock)
                           --- God is attended by his angels; though the Romans may be called his <i>saints,</i> or people destined to execute his decrees
                           in this war, Isaias xiii. 3., and Sophonias i. 7., and Deuteronomy xxxiii. 3., and Joel iii. 1. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           his Church, (Calmet) were both devoured by worms. (Josephus, Antiquities xvii. 9., and xix. 7.) (Acts xii. 13.) --- Nero slew
                           himself; Maximian was eaten to death by an inward ulcer; and his colleague's (Maximinus) eyes fell from his head. (Eusebius
                           in Constantine i. 57., and 59.) --- It would seem as if Zacharias beheld them. He may also speak of the attempts of God, and
