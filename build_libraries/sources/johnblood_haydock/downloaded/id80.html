                           was a certain rich man,</I> &amp;c. By this parable, our Saviour advises his disciples to accompany their penitential works
                           with deeds of mercy to the poor. (Ven. Bede) --- There is a certain erroneous opinion, that obtains pretty generally amongst
                           mankind, and which tends to increase crimes, and to lessen good works: and this is, the foolish persuasion that men are not
                           accountable to any one, and that we can dispose as we please of the things in our possession. (St. Chrysostom) --- Whereas
                           we are here informed, that we are only the dispensers of another's property, viz. God's. (St. Ambrose) --- When, therefore,
                           we employ it not according to the will of our Master, but fritter and squander it away in pleasure, and in the gratification
                           of our passions, we are, beyond all doubt, unjust stewards. (Theophylactus) --- And a strict account will be required of what
                           we have thus dissipated, by our common Lord and Master. If then we are only stewards of that which we possess, let us cast
                           from our minds that mean superciliousness and pride which the outward splendour of riches is so apt to inspire; and let us
                           put on the humility, the modesty of stewards, knowing well that to whom much is given, much will be required. Abundance of
                           riches makes not a man great, but the dispensing them according to the will and intention of his employer. (Haydock) --- The
                           intention of this parable, is to shew what use each one ought to make of the goods which God has committed to his charge.
                           In the three former parables, addressed to the murmuring Scribes and Pharisees, our Saviour shews with what goodness he seeks
                           the salvation and conversion of a sinner; in this, he teaches how the sinner, when converted, ought to correspond to his vocation,
                           and preserve with great care the inestimable blessing of innocence. (Calmet) --- <I>A steward,</I> &amp;c. The parable puts
                           us in mind, that let men be ever so rich or powerful in this world, God is still their master; they are his servants, and
                           must be accountable to him how they have managed his gifts and favours; that is, all things they have had in this world. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           he called him,</I> &amp;c. Such are the words which our Lord daily addresses to us. We daily see persons equally healthy,
                           and likely to live as ourselves, suddenly summoned by death, to give an account of their stewardship. Happy summons to the
                           faithful servant, who has reason to hope in his faithful administration. Not so to the unfaithful steward, whose pursuits
                           are earthly: death to him is terrible indeed, and his exit is filled with sorrow. All thunder-stricken at these words, "now
                           thou canst be steward no longer," he says within himself, what shall I do! (St. Thomas Aquinas)</FONT></P><B>

                           the lord commended,</I> &amp;c. By this we are given to understand, that if the lord of this unjust steward could commend
                           him for his worldly prudence, though it were an overt act of injustice; how much more will the Almighty be pleased with those
                           who, obedient to his command, seek to redeem their sins by alms-deeds? (St. Thomas Aquinas) --- "Give alms out of thy substance,"
                           says holy Tobias to his son, "and turn not thy face from any poor person: for so it shall come to pass, that the face of the
                           Lord shall not be turned from thee. According to thy abilities be merciful. If thou hast much, give abundantly; if thou hast
                           little, take care, even of that little, to bestow willingly a little. For thus thou storest up to thyself a good reward, for
                           the day of necessity. For alms deliver from sin, and from death, and will not suffer the soul to go into darkness." (Tobias
                           iv. 7, 8, &amp;c.) (St. Thomas Aquinas) --- <I>Children of this world,</I> &amp;c. are more prudent and circumspect as to
                           what regards their temporal concerns, than they who profess themselves servants of God, are about the concerns of eternity.
                           --- <I>Commended the unjust steward.</I>[1] Literally, the <I>steward of iniquity:</I> not for his cheating and injustice,
                           but for his contrivances in favour of himself. --- <I>In their generation;</I> i.e. in their concerns of this life. They apply
                           themselves with greater care and pains, in their temporal affairs, than the <I>children of light,</I> whom God has favoured
                           with the light of faith, do to gain heaven. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           for yourselves friends,</I> &amp;c. Not that we are authorized to wrong our neighbour, to give to the poor: evil is never
                           to be done, that good may come from it. (St. Thomas Aquinas) --- But we are exhorted to make the poor our friends before God,
                           by relieving them with the riches which justly indeed belong to us, but are called <I>the mammon of iniquity,</I> because
                           only the iniquitous man esteems them as riches, on which he sets his affections; whilst the riches of the virtuous are wholly
                           celestial and spiritual. (St. Augustine, de quæst. Evang.) --- <I>Of the mammon of iniquity.</I> Mammon is a Syriac word for
                           riches; and so it might be translated, <I>of the riches of iniquity.</I> Riches are called <I>unjust,</I> and riches of <I>iniquity,</I>
                           not of themselves, but because they are many times the occasion of unjust dealings, and of all kind of vices. (Witham) ---
                           <I>Mammon</I> signifies <I>riches.</I> They are here called the <I>mammon of iniquity,</I> because oftentimes ill-gotten,
                           ill-bestowed, or an occasion of evil; and at the best are but worldly, and false: and not the true riches of a Christian.
                           --- <I>They may receive.</I> By this we see, that the poor servants of God, whom we have relieved by our alms, may hereafter,
                           by their intercession, bring our souls to heaven. (Challoner) --- They may receive you into their eternal tabernacles. What
                           a beautiful thought this! What a consolation to the rich man, when the term of his mortal existence is approaching, to think
                           he shall have as many advocates to plead for his admittance into the eternal mansions of rest, as he has made friends among
                           the poor by relieving their temporal wants. The rich give to the poor earthly treasures, the latter return in recompense eternal
                           and infinite happiness. Hence we must infer, that the advantage is all on the side of the giver; according to the saying of
                           our Lord, happier is the condition of him who gives, than of him who receives. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           that is faithful in that which is least.</I> This seems to have been a common saying, and that men judged of the honesty of
                           their servants by their fidelity in lesser matters. For example, a master that sees his servant will not steal a little thing,
                           judges that he will not steal a greater, &amp;c. --- <I>And he that is unjust in that which is little, is unjust also in that

                           that when we give alms, we are liberal of another's goods. But if we are not liberal in giving what is another's, how shall
                           we be so in giving our own? Nothing one would have thought so properly belonged to the Jews, as the kingdom of heaven, the
                           preaching of the gospel, and the knowledge of heavenly things. But they were deprived of all for their infidelity in the observance

                           but to receive repenting sinners, and to redeem their own sins with alms. But they derided these precepts of mercy and humility;

                           them. (Ven. Bede) --- The Pharisees considered temporal riches as true goods, and the recompense which God had promised to
                           such as observed his laws; they therefore laughed at the doctrine of Jesus Christ, which extolled liberality and alms-deeds,
                           and despised the Master who, on all occasions, testified his great regard for poverty in his discourses, in his conduct, in
                           the choice of his apostles, who were all poor, and had no pretensions whatever to exterior pomp or show. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           succour him. (St. Cyril, in Cat. Græc. patrum.) --- He that hath the substance of this world, and shall see his brother in

                           of the Jews informs us, that this <I>Lazarus</I> was a beggar, then at Jerusalem, suffering in the most wretched condition
                           of poverty, and infirmity: him our Saviour introduces, to manifest more plainly the truth of what he had been saying (St.
                           Cyril, in Cat. Græc. patrum.) --- By this, we are not to understand that all poverty is holy, and the possession of riches
                           criminal; but, as luxury is the disgrace of riches, so holiness of life is the ornament of poverty. (St. Ambrose) --- A man
                           may be reserved and modest in the midst of riches and honours, as he may be proud and avaricious in the obscurity of a poor
                           and wretched life. --- Divers interpreters have looked upon this as a true history; but what is said of the rich man <I>seeing
                           </I>Lazarus, of his <I>tongue,</I> of his <I>finger,</I> cannot be literal: souls having no such parts. (Witham) --- In this
                           parable, which St. Ambrose takes to be a real fact, we have the name of the poor mendicant; but our Lord suppresses the name
                           of the rich man, to signify that his name is blotted out of the book of life: besides, the rich man tells Abraham, that he
                           has five brothers, who were probably still living; wherefore, to save their honour, our Lord named not their reprobated brother.</FONT></P><B>

                           and suffered in another world, it would make more impression upon us than past miracles, which we hear of, or the promises
                           and threats of the prophets, apostles, and our blessed Saviour, which are contained in Scripture; but it is a false notion,
                           a vain excuse. The wicked, and unbelievers, would even in that case find pretexts and objections for not believing. (St. Chrysostom,
                           hom. iv.) --- They would say that the dead man was a phantom; that his resurrection was not real; his assertions nugatory.
                           When Christ raised Lazarus from the dead, the miracle was known, evident and public; yet we find none of the Pharisees converted
                           by it. They were even so mad as to enter into a design to kill Lazarus, to get rid of a witness who deposed against their
                           incredulity. How many other miracles did he not perform in their sight, which they attributed to the prince of darkness, or
                           to magic? Christ raised himself from the dead. This fact was attested by many unexceptionable witnesses. And what do the hardened
                           Jews do? They object, that his disciples, stealing away the body, maliciously persuaded the people that he had risen again.
                           Such is the corruption of the human heart, that when once delivered up to any passion, nothing can move it. Every day we see
                           or hear of malefactors publicly executed, yet their example has no effect on the survivors, nor does it prevent the commission
                           of fresh crimes. (Calmet) --- "We have also the more firm prophetical word; whereunto you do well to attend, as to a light
                           that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts." (2 Peter i. 19.) --- We may learn
                           many very instructive lessons from this affecting history of Lazarus. --- <I>The rich</I> may learn the dreadful consequences
                           to be apprehended from riches, when made subservient to <I>sensuality, luxury, </I>and <I>ambition.</I> The <I>poor</I> may
                           learn to make their poverty and sufferings, however grievous to nature, instrumental to their future happiness, by bearing
                           them with patience and resignation to the will of heaven. The former are taught that to expose a man to eternal misery, nothing
                           more is required than to enjoy all the <I>good things</I> of this world according to their own will; the latter, that however
                           they may be despised and rejected of men, they may still have courage, knowing that the short day of this fleeting life, with
                           all its apparent evils, will soon be over; and that the day of eternity is fast approaching, when every one shall receive
                           according as he has done good or evil in his body. (Haydock)</FONT></P>
