                           the day of vengeance, will be the having been supplanted, like wrestlers, by our iniquity, (Calmet) of which we have not repented.

                           The just, on the contrary, who have <i>laboured</i> for eternity, <i>shall see</i> the death of the wicked, or of the wise

                                    <P>16 But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when he shall receive me.</P>
                                    <P>17 Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rich, and when the glory of his house shall be increased.</P>
