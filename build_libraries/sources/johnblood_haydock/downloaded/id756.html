                           <p><strong>Ver. 1.</strong> <i>Understanding;</i> (Protestants <i>mascil.;</i> Haydock) shewing how he was brought to acknowledge
                           his fault, and by penance to obtain pardon, (Worthington) justly giving the glory to God's grace. (St. Augustine) --- Alexandrian
                           Septuagint, ["A psalm] to David," <i>of understanding;</i> which is taken from some other copy. (Haydock) --- Some suppose
                           this word has been inserted from ver 8. (Abenezra) --- But there are several other psalms which have this title, (Haydock)
                           intimating either that they contain great mysteries, (Eusebius) or that they are easy to understand. (Agellius) --- This is
                           wholly of a moral nature. The Jews style it the <i>heart</i> of David, because it displays his sentiments of contrition. (Calmet)
                           --- He composed it most probably after Nathan had engaged him to confess his fault. [2 Kings xii.] (Bellarmine) --- It might
                           be used on the solemn feast of expiation. (Grotius, Numbers xxix. 7.) --- The Fathers explain it of the grace which we receive
                           in baptism and in penance. (St. Augustine; St. Gregory, &amp;c.) (Calmet) --- <i>Are they.</i> Hebrew, "The blessings of him
                           whose iniquity." (Pagnin) --- But the sense is the same, and St. Paul follows the Septuagint, which gives their version the
                           highest authority, Romans iv. 7. --- <i>Sins;</i> or, "who is screened from the punishment of sin." (Prin. disc.) Sin has
                           often this signification; and the psalmist would otherwise seem to say less than he had already expressed. (Berthier) ---
                           <i>Covered,</i> by charity, (1 Peter iv.) as a physician covers a wound, to remove it entirely; and we must cover our former
                           transgressions, by doing good works. (St. Gregory) --- Then our sins will not appear at the day of judgment, (St. Jerome)
                           nor be punished, as they are wholly destroyed. The Pelagians calumniated Catholics, as if they taught that sins were only
                           shaven, as it were, the roots still remaining; which St. Augustine (contra 2 ep. Pelag. i. 13.) says, "None affirmeth but
                           an infidel." Thus the doctrine of Calvin is condemned; who abuses these texts to prove that sins are only covered, and still
                           remain even in the most just; which is contrary to innumerable passages of Scripture, (Isaias vi., John i., 1 Corinthians
                           vi., &amp;c.) and injurious to the perfections of God, and to the redemption of Christ, as well as to the saints in heaven,
                           who are thus represented as still infected with all their sins. (Worthington) --- This doctrine is now almost abandoned by
                           Protestants, as it is contrary both to sound philosophy and divinity: for sin is nothing physical, but a want of moral rectitude.
                           (Berthier) --- God cannot fail to punish sin, wherever it really subsists. His spirit is surely free from <i>guile.</i> He
                           cannot suppose that we are just by imputation of Christ's justice, unless we be really so. (Haydock) --- By means of the sacraments
                           the sinner becomes just, and God sees nothing in him deserving of punishment. (Calmet) --- "If any one wishes his sins to
                           be covered, let him manifest them to God, by the voice of confession." (St. Gregory) --- But, replies a Lutheran commentator,
                           "God does not forget sin." What is this to the purpose, as long as the sin does not subsist in the offender? He allows that
                           "the pardon of sin is inseparable from sanctification." <i>Renew a right spirit within my bowels,</i> Psalm l. 12. (Berthier)
                           --- The man who has felt real compunction, will be able to form a true notion of the happiness of a reconciliation. (Calmet)
                           --- Covering may allude to the custom of writing on wax, which might easily be effaced. Our sins are recorded in the book
                           of God's justice. (Menochius)</p>

                           have it, though Grabe substitutes <i>spirit,</i> (Haydock) which is recognised by St. Jerome (ad. Sun.), Hebrew, &amp;c. Nothing
                           is so contrary to true repentance as hypocrisy. (St. Augustine, &amp;c.) (Calmet) --- If we do not co-operate with God's grace,
                           our sins will never be effaced, though, before remission, our works can only dispose us to receive pardon. "God (and meritorious)
                           works follow." (St. Augustine) (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           of his own merits; (St. Augustine; St. Jerome; Calmet) or David was silent till Nathan made him know his fault, which he afterwards
                           ceased not to deplore. (Theodoret) --- It is supposed that he had continued impenitent for above a year. But he might fell

                           not my grievous sins, I was much afflicted. I prayed, but to little purpose. (Worthington) --- Wishing to conceal the cause
                           of my grief, (Calmet) I pined away, (Haydock; Lamentations iii. 4.) and suffered greatly, because I did not confess. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           justice pierces my flesh, and sticks fast in me. Or, <i>I am turned;</i> that is, I am converted to thee, my God, by being
                           brought to a better understanding by thy chastisements. In the Hebrew it is, <i>my moisture is turned into the droughts of
                           summer.</i> (Challoner) (Protestants) (Haydock) --- But the Septuagint may have taken <i>l</i> for a preposition before <i>shaddi,</i>
                           as the Greek interpreters say nothing of this <i>moisture,</i> which is the interpretation of modern Jews; and St. Jerome
                           has (Berthier) "I was turned <i>or</i> occupied, in my misery;" <i>versatus sum in miseria mea.</i> There is no peace for
                           the wicked. (Haydock) --- God has not punished David exteriorly till after the admonition of Nathan, when so many evils poured
                           upon him. But the king must have experienced cruel agonies of mind, till he was prevailed on by this wise physician to confess
                           his fault, (Calmet) and thus let out the imposthume, which would not allow him to enjoy any repose. --- <i>Fastened.</i> St.
                           Jerome, "while the summer (<i>or</i> heat; <i>æstas</i>) was burning incessantly," <i>sela.</i> Hebrew <i>becharbone kayits</i>
                           means also <i>in gladios spina.</i> "The thorn has been turned into swords for my affliction;" (Berthier) or I have been as
                           grievously tormented, as if a thorn or sword had pierced me. (Haydock) --- Thy divine Providence chastises me, and my conscience
                           tells me that I have deserved all my sufferings. (Worthington) --- Many of the ancients read, <i>while the thorn is broken,
                           confringitur,</i> Ps. Rom.[Roman Psalter?]; St. Gregory; Calmet) which causes the extraction to be more difficult. (Haydock)
                           --- This thorn may denote sin, which like a weed, had infected David's soul. (Theodoret) (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Sin.</i> Or as some psalters read, "of my heart," with the Septuagint, Cassiod., &amp;c. (Calmet) --- "I know that thou
                           wilt readily forgive the sins which are fully laid open before thee." (St. Jerome) --- David no sooner perceived that he was
                           the unjust man (Haydock) whom Nathan had described, than he exclaimed, "I have sinned;" and at the same moment God forgave
                           him, 2 Kings xii. 7. (Calmet) --- If this psalm relate to his repentance, it seems he had already had recourse to God; but
                           this is doubtful, as he appears to have entered into himself only after the prophet's reproach. Nothing can more effectually
                           give peace to the soul than an humble confession, which costs human pride a great deal, when it must be made to our brethren.
                           (Berthier) --- The Jews were sometimes obliged to confess to God's minister, Leviticus iv. 5., and Numbers v. 7. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           (St. Jerome) (Haydock) --- A deluge denotes great calamities, Isaias xliii. 2. Even the terrors of the last day will not disturb
                           the just, (Calmet) nor will they inspire the wicked with true repentance. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           or God threatens the obstinate with rigour of his justice. Many delude themselves, thinking that he will always treat them
                           with lenity, and be ready to receive them. (Berthier) (Isaias xxxvii. 29.) But the prophet admonishes them not to follow their
                           senses alone, nor to imitate brute beasts, as he had done with regard to Bathsabee and Urias. (Menochius) --- The bit (<i>camus</i>)

                                    <p>Blessed *are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</p>
                                    <p>2 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin, and in whose spirit there is no guile.</p>
                                    <p>3 Because I was silent, my bones grew old; whilst I cried out all the day long.</p>
                                    <p>4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: I am turned in my anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened.</p>
                                    <p>5 I have acknowledged my sin to thee, and my injustice I have not concealed.</p>
                                    <p>*I said, I will confess against myself my injustice to the Lord; and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin.</p>
                                    <p>6 For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee in a seasonable time.</p>
                                    <p>And yet in a flood of many waters, they shall not come nigh unto him.</p>
                                    <p>7 Thou art my refuge from the trouble which hath encompassed me: my joy, deliver me from them that surround me.</p>
                                    <p>8 I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this way, in which thou shalt go: I will fix my eyes upon
                                    thee.</p>
                                    <p>9 Do not become like the horse and the mule, which have no understanding.</p>
                                    <p>With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws who come not near unto thee.</p>
                                    <p>10 Many are the scourges of the sinner, but mercy shall encompass him that hopeth in the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>11 Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just, and glory, all ye right of heart.</p></font></font>
