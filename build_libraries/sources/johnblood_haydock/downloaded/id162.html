                           called</I> to be <I>an apostle.</I> St. Paul had preached to the Corinthians, and had remained a long time with them, to instruct
                           and confirm them in the faith. During his absence, the faithful of Corinth were divided into several parties, on occasion
                           of some new teachers, who had come amongst them. (Calmet) --- It was to heal the wounds caused by these divisions, that the
                           present epistle was written. (St. Thomas Aquinas; Haydock) --- <I>And Sosthenes.</I> There are various conjectures made concerning
                           the person St. Paul here mentions. Some are of opinion that this Sosthenes is the same mentioned, Acts xviii. 17. who was
                           beaten before the tribunal of Gallio, proconsul of Achaia, when St. Paul was carried before that magistrate. Eusebius says,
                           that Sosthenes was one of the 72 disciples, and a different person from the one mentioned in Acts. Estius takes him to be
                           St. Paul's secretary. The common opinion is, that he was a great sufferer for the faith at Corinth, and St. Paul here mentions
                           him as a man worthy their imitation. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           makes him say, <I>was Paul crucified for you,</I> &amp;c. He tells them the occasion why he baptized few, because he was sent

                           for the elected. (Bible de Vence) --- Consider your manner of being called; not many, hitherto, of those who have believed,
                           or of those who have preached the gospel, <I>are wise according to the flesh,</I> or as to worldly wisdom; and in the esteem

                           says St. Chrysostom, men reputed as nothing, of no consideration, to confound, to destroy, to make subject to him, and to
                           the gospel, men who had the greatest worldly advantages, <I>that no flesh,</I> no men how great, wise, rich, or powerful soever,

                           in the Lord.</I> (Witham) --- <I>And the mean things.</I> In the beginning of Christianity, it was frequently objected to
                           the Christians, that they had none but men of the basest extraction. The emperor Julian likewise made the Catholics the same
                           reproach. (Grotius) --- But this objection was not founded; for we find many persons of consideration mentioned in the Scriptures,
                           who had embraced Christianity. Witness, ver. 1. of this chap., Sosthenes, the head of the synagogue at Corinth, and some in
                           the very palace of Cæsar.</FONT></P><B>

                           but of the omnipotent power of his divinity. (Calmet)</FONT></P>
                           <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">We may here admire, (ver. 1.) the happiness of those who, like St. Paul,
                           are called to the sacred ministry, not through human respects, nor by any influence of parents, but by the vocation of heaven.
                           --- Ver. 2. We have here the model and origin of all future pastoral letters. --- Ver. 3. &amp;c. he gives thanks to God for
                           past favours, and prays for a continuation of graces and blessings. --- Ver. 10. He begs that there be no schisms found among
                           them, but that unanimity of sentiment and disposition may reign among them, certain and unequivocal marks of truth. --- Ver.
                           12. &amp;c. He shews that both pastors and flocks should look up to God, as the only source of truth and grace; that it is
                           a crying injustice to withdraw any share of our heart and confidence from God, to fix it on any thing that is not God; as
                           it is to attach ourselves to the ministers of truth, and not to the <B>Truth</B> itself. Therefore, concludes St. Paul, though
                           the Jews call for miracles, and the Gentiles lean upon worldly wisdom, Christians must seek their strength and success in
                           the weakness of the cross, and their glory in the ignominy of Christ crucified, to whom alone be all the honour and glory
                           for ever and ever. Amen.</FONT></P>
