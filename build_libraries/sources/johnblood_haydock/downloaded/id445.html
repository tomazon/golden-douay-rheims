                           flowers." --- The <I>stone,</I> which is here condemned, is one set up "for adoration." (Onkelos) --- Hebrew, "a stone of
                           sight," placed on some eminence, or on the high roads. Strabo, (xvii.) speaking of those which he had seen in Egypt along
                           the roads, says, "they are lofty, polished, and almost like a sphere, some 12 feet in diameter. There are sometimes three,
                           of different dimensions, one upon another. Some were to be seen upon Mount Libanus. They were objects of adoration." The Greeks
                           raised heaps of stones on the high roads, in honour of Mercury,&nbsp;Proverbs xxvi. 7[8?]. (Calmet) --- We are not forbidden
                           to place land-marks, &amp;c.: but we must not adore them. (Du Hamel)</FONT></P><B>

                           The Rabbins inform us, with what respect their ancestors appeared in the temple. They left their sticks and shoes behind them,
                           and washed their feet; entering solely to perform some act of religion, and not to go a shorter road to another street. When
                           they had ended their devotions, they retired slowly without turning their back to the sanctuary. (Outram, Sacrif. lib. 3.

                           to keep in their houses two or three months together, on account of the overflowing of the Nile. In that country, as well
                           as in Greece and Palestine, people sow both wheat and barley about October; while in other countries the latter is sown in
                           spring. The harvest is ready in about six months, and that of wheat in seven. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xviii. 18.; Hesiod,
