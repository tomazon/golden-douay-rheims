                           (Vatable) --- This comparison shews the utmost distress to which the people of Jerusalem were reduced. Any great anguish is
                           denoted by a <i>woman in travail,</i> Deuteronomy ii. 25., and Psalm xlvii. 7. Homer (Iliad <i><u>A</u></i>) thus describes
                           the uneasiness of Agamemnon. (Calmet) --- Ezechias found himself unable to contend with the Assyrian, though he wished to
                           do it. (Menochius) --- Without courage, all hope of escaping is lost. (Du Hamel)</font></p><b>

                           Strabo, (i., and xv. p. 653.) extended his conquests as far as the pillars of Hercules. (Megasthenes) --- The Egyptians seem
                           to have called him Sethon, and assert that the god (Vulcan) appeared to him on the approach of Sennacherib, assuring him of
                           his protection. He encamped near Pelusium, where the enemy's army on its arrival was infested with rats, which destroyed their
                           armour, and made them an easy prey. (Herodotus ii. 141.) It is probable that Taphnes, near Pelusium, was the capital city
                           of Tharaca, Isaias xviii., and xxx. 4. He does not appear to have joined battle with Sennacherib, whose army was destroyed
                           on its march (Isaias x. 24.) the very night that the prophet promised Ezechias a deliverance.</font></p><b>
