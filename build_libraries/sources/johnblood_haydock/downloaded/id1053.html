                           ad Pop. Ant.) -- Septuagint add, "upon the dung, without the city: and after a long time had elapsed, his wife also said to
                           him, How long wilt thou wait, saying: Lo, I will still tarry a little while, expecting the hope of my salvation? For behold
                           thy memory is perished from the land, thy sons and daughters, the pains and labours of my womb, whom I brought forth in labour
                           and sorrow, to no purpose. But thou sittest in the open air, the night long, amid the corruption of worms, while I wander
                           <i>like</i> a slave, seeking for one place and house after another, in expectation of the sun setting, that my labours may
                           cease, and the sorrows which now surround and hold me fast. But speak thou some word to (or against) the Lord, and die." (Haydock)
                           --- This addition has been omitted in the Complutensian edition, to make it like the Vulgate, (Calmet) though it is found
                           in all the Greek copies (Nobilius) and fathers, and also in several Latin Bibles. It seems, however, to be only a gloss of
                           some transcriber. The devil had not destroyed this wife, as she would prove one of his most powerful auxiliaries. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           after taking this revenge on such unjust treatment, put an end to thy own existence. Beza and Amama excuse this woman, though
                           condemned by Job. They pretend that she only meant to insinuate, like the rest of his friends, that he must be guilty of some
                           grievous crime, which she urges him to confess, giving glory to God, before it be too late. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           all that time that could give him any uneasiness. (Challoner) (Menochius) (Olympiad.) --- They mourned for him as if he had
                           been dead. Their mutual grief was too great for utterance. But the text seems to intimate that they remained with Job, all
                           this time. (Scultet.) (Calmet) --- Their design in coming was really to afford him consolation; but being under a mistake,
                           respecting the conduct of Providence towards mankind, (Calmet) they erred involuntarily, (Tirinus) and by attempting to prove

                           Tobias ii. 15. --- They argued on the principle, "that under a just God no one is miserable, unless he have deserved it;"
                           not reflecting that God sometimes puts his best servants to the trial, that their merit and glory may increase. Notwithstanding
                           their piety and learning, they became therefore the devil's most powerful agents unawares: (Calmet) and though they were not
                           properly heretics, as they acquiesced when better informed, they were a figure of them, by drawing from many undeniable truths
                           false inferences, and by a parade of learning, and of <i>new things.</i> (St. Gregory, Mor. iii. 24., and v. 18.) --- They
                           also judged rashly of Job's secret behaviour. (Worthington)</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>

                                    said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">3 And the Lord said to satan: Hast thou considered my servant, Job, that

                                    But thou hast moved me against him, that I should afflict him without cause.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">4 And satan answered, and said: Skin for skin; and all that a man hath,

                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">6 And the Lord said to satan: Behold, he is in thy hand, but yet save his
