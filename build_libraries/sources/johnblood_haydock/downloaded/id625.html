                           God, it is not allowable in any wars, how just soever, to kill children. (Challoner) --- The Israelites were now to execute

                           contrition as that he might deserve to hear, <i>the Lord has removed thy sin.</i> He begins by falsehood; continues making
                           idle excuses, and throwing the blame on others, and concludes, by shewing that he is more concerned for what his subjects
                           may think and do against him, than for the displeasure of God. He boldly ventures to offer victims. But Samuel joins not with
                           him in prayer, looking upon him as a person excommunicated; and he only attends that he may see the word of the Lord fulfilled,
                           and Agag treated as he deserved. (Salien, the year of the world 2965.)</font></p><b>

                                    down to Galgal. And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul was offering a holocaust to the Lord out of the choicest of the spoils,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And Samuel said: *Doth the Lord desire holocausts and victims, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Because it is like the sin of witchcraft, to rebel: and like the crime

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And Samuel turned about to go away: but he laid hold upon the skirt

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And Samuel said to him: *The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 But the Triumpher in Israel will not spare, and will not be moved

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 Then he said: I have sinned: yet honour me now before the ancients

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 So Samuel turned again after Saul: and Saul adored the Lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 And Samuel said: Bring hither to me Agag, the king of Amalec. And

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And Samuel said: As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And Samuel departed to Ramatha: but Saul went up to his house in Gabaa.</font></p>
