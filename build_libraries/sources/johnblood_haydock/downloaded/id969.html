                           even left the buildings erected by Solomon standing, (4 Kings xxiii. 13.; Tirinus) thinking they might be no longer dangerous.
                           (Salien) --- Several other pious kings did the like, for which they deserved some reprehension; as they could not be ignorant,
                           that this was considered as wrong by the more enlightened, Ecclesiasticus xlix. 5. (Tirinus) --- It was the king's duty to
                           destroy the exterior practices of idolatry, while the priests and prophets were to instruct. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           "images." (Haydock) --- Asa was encouraged to perfect the work which he had begun, by the exhortation of Azarias, chap. xv.

                           <i>Ethiopian.</i> Some think Zara was a successor of Sesac; and the Rabbins say, that he "restored the spoils which the latter
                           had taken." (Seder. xvi.) --- He at least, made the Jews some compensation for that loss. Perhaps he had been present in the
                           expedition of Sesac, and was now animated with the same ambition. (Tirinus) --- It would be difficult for a foreign king to
                           traverse Egypt with so large an army, (Calmet) unless he had conquered or intimidated the king of the country. (Haydock) ---
                           Hence some believe that the Ethiopia here in question, was a part of Arabia. (Calmet) (Torniel.) --- But it is more probable
                           that it lay south of Egypt, as the troops of Zara are joined with the Lybians, chap. xvi. 8. (Salien, the year of the world
                           3094.) (Tirinus) --- A king of Arabia would hardly have had so many subjects. (Calmet) --- <i>Three.</i> Some would read thirteen,
                           as Anani takes notice of the great number of chariots, chap. xvi. 8. (Junius) (Malvenda) (Calmet) --- But surely the number
                           here specified is sufficient. The minds of men are very different. In the former chapter we find them complaining of the too
                           great numbers! (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           It seems not to have been considerable, as the people of Asia, the Greeks and Romans, trusted more to their infantry; and,
                           in effect, no species of warfare is more costly to a state, nor less useful, than a multitude of horses, which were introduced
