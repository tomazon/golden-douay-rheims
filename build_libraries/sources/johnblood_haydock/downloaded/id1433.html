                           <i>He struck himself,</i> &amp;c. St. Augustine (Epist. lxi. ad Dulcitium et lib. 2. cap. 23. ad Epist. 2. Gaud.) discussing
                           this fact of Razias, says that the holy Scripture relates it, but doth not praise it, as to be admired or imitated, and that
                           it was not well done by him, or at least not proper in this time of grace. (Challoner) --- Whether he was thus inspired or
                           not, we dare not decide. The Jews infer form the conduct of Samson, Saul, and Razias, that suicide is lawful when a person
                           fears being overcome by torments, or giving occasion to other's blasphemy. But Christianity lays down better maxims; (Romans
                           iii. 8.) and St. Augustine, (contra Gaud. i. 31., and ep. 61 or 204) St. Thomas Aquinas, ([Summa Theologiae] ii. 2. q. 64.
                           a. 5.) and others, disapprove of this action, observing that it is recorded and not praised, though other virtues of Razias
                           be commended. (Calmet) --- It was either not well done, or not to be imitated in this time of grace. (St. Augustine, ii. 23.
                           contra ep. 2. Gaud.) (Worthington) --- Yet this holy doctor excuses Samson and some Christian virgins, by saying that they
                           acted by the direction of the Holy Spirit. (Sup. and City of God i. 21.) (Haydock) (Lyranus) Tirinius) --- This seems to be
                           here the case, as the fact appears to be commended. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                                    himself in the time of mingling <i>with the heathens</i>, seeing that there was no safety for him, nor access to the altar,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 Came to king Demetrius in the year *one hundred and fifty, presenting
                                    unto him a crown of gold, and a palm, and besides these, some boughs which seemed to belong to the temple. And that day indeed
                                    he held his peace.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 But having gotten a convenient time to further his madness, being called
                                    to counsel by Demetrius, and asked what the Jews relied upon, and what were their counsels,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 He answered thereunto: They among the Jews that are called Assideans,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 Principally indeed out of fidelity to the king's interests, but in

                                    of those men.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Wherefore, O king, seeing thou knowest all these things, take care,

                                    be quiet.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 Now when this man had spoken to this effect, the rest also of the
                                    <i>king's</i> friends, who were enemies of Judas, incensed Demetrius against him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And forthwith he sent Nicanor, the commander over the elephants, governor
                                    into Judea:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 Giving him in charge, to take Judas himself: and disperse all them
                                    that were with him, and to make Alcimus the high priest of the great temple.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 Then the Gentiles who had fled out of Judea, from Judas, came to Nicanor
                                    by flocks, thinking the miseries and calamities of the Jews to be the welfare of their affairs.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Now when the Jews heard of Nicanor's coming, and that the nations
                                    were assembled against them, they cast earth upon their heads, and made supplication to him who chose his people to keep them
                                    for ever, and who protected his portion by evident signs.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 Then at the commandment of their captain, they forthwith removed from
                                    the place where they were, and went to the town of Dessau, to meet them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Now Simon, the brother of Judas, had joined battle with Nicanor, but
                                    was frightened with the sudden coming of the adversaries.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Nevertheless Nicanor hearing of the valour of Judas' companions, and
                                    the greatness of courage, with which they fought for their country, was afraid to try the matter by the sword.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 Wherefore he sent Posidonius, and Theodotius, and Matthias before
                                    to present and receive the right hands.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And when there had been a consultation thereupon, and the captain
                                    had acquainted the multitude with it, they were all of one mind to consent to covenants.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 So they appointed a day upon which they might commune together by
                                    themselves: and seats were brought out, and set for each one.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 But Judas ordered armed men to be ready in convenient places, lest
                                    some mischief might be suddenly practised by the enemies: so they made an agreeable conference.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And Nicanor abode in Jerusalem, and did no wrong, but sent away the
                                    flocks of the multitudes that had been gathered together.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And Judas was always dear to him from the heart, and he was well affected
                                    to the man.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And he desired him to marry a wife, and to have children. So he married:
                                    he lived quietly, and they lived in common.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 But Alcimus seeing the love they had one to another, and the covenants,
                                    came to Demetrius, and told him that Nicanor assented to the foreign interest, for that he meant to make Judas, who was a
                                    traitor to the kingdom, his successor.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 Then the king, being in a rage, and provoked with this man's wicked
                                    accusations, wrote to Nicanor, signifying that he was greatly displeased with the covenant of friendship: and that he commanded
                                    him nevertheless to send Machabeus prisoner in all haste to Antioch.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 When this was known, Nicanor was in a consternation, and took it grievously
                                    that he should make void the articles that were agreed upon, having received no injury from the man.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 But because he could not oppose the king, he watched an opportunity
                                    to comply with the orders.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 But when Machabeus perceived that Nicanor was more stern to him, and
                                    that when they met together as usual he behaved himself in a rough manner; and was sensible that this rough behaviour came
                                    not of good, he gathered together a few of his men, and hid himself from Nicanor.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 But he finding himself notably prevented by the man, came to the great
                                    and holy temple: and commanded the priests that were offering the accustomed sacrifices, to deliver him the man.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 And when they swore unto him, that they knew not where the man was
                                    whom he sought, he stretched out his hand to the temple,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And swore, saying: Unless you deliver Judas prisoner to me, I will
                                    lay this temple of God even with the ground, and will beat down the altar, and I will dedicate this temple to Bacchus.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And when he had spoken thus, he departed. But the priests stretching
                                    forth their hands to heaven, called upon him that was ever the defender of their nation, saying in this manner:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 Thou, O Lord of all things, who wantest nothing, wast pleased that
                                    the temple of thy habitation should be amongst us.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 Therefore now, O Lord, the holy of all holies, keep this house for
                                    ever undefiled, which was lately cleansed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 Now Razias, one of the ancients of Jerusalem, was accused to Nicanor,
                                    a man that was a lover of the city, and of good report, who for his kindness was called the father of the Jews.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 This man, for a long time, had held fast his purpose of keeping himself
                                    pure in the Jews' religion, and was ready to expose his body and life, that he might persevere therein.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 So Nicanor being willing to declare the hatred that he bore the Jews,
                                    sent five hundred soldiers to take him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 For he thought by ensnaring him to hurt the Jews very much.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 Now as the multitude sought to rush into his house, and to break open
                                    the door, and to set fire to it, when he was ready to be taken, he struck himself with his sword:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 Choosing to die nobly rather than to fall into the hands of the wicked,
                                    and to suffer abuses unbecoming his noble birth.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 But whereas through haste he missed of giving&nbsp;a sure wound, and
                                    the crowd was breaking into the doors, he ran boldly to the wall, and manfully threw himself down to the crowd:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 But they quickly making room for his fall, he came upon the midst
                                    of the neck.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">45 And as he had yet breath in him, being inflamed in mind, he arose:
                                    and while his blood ran down with a great stream, and he was grievously wounded, he ran through the crowd:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">46 And standing upon a steep rock, when he was now almost without blood,
                                    grasping his bowels, with both hands he cast them upon the throng, calling upon the Lord of life and spirit, to restore these
                                    to him again: and so he departed this life.</font></p>
