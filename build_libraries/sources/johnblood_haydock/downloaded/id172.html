                           head of the woman is the man,</I> &amp;c. To have the head covered at public meetings, is, according to St. Paul, a mark of
                           subjection: The man was created to be <I>head</I> over the woman, who was made subject to the man, being <I>made</I> of him,
                           of his rib, and the woman <I>made for him,</I> not he <I>for the woman.</I> The man in a special manner, is the <I>image of
                           God,</I> not only by his immortal soul, in which sense also the woman was made to God's image, and likeness, but inasmuch
                           as God gave him a power over all creatures, and so he is called, <I>the glory of God.</I> For these reasons, as well as from
                           a received custom, St. Paul tells every woman, that in prayer or prophesying in public meetings, she must have her head veiled,
                           and covered in testimony of her subjection to man, her head, otherwise she dishonours herself, and her head. This is what
                           he tells her, (ver. 10.) that she ought <I>to have a power over her head,</I>[1] that is, to have a veil or covering, as a
                           mark of man's power over her: and <I>because of the angels,</I> that is, out of a respect to the angels there present. Some
                           understand the priests and ministers of God, called angels, particularly in the Apocalypse. St. Paul adds, that nature[2]
                           having given to women long hair, designed it to be as a natural veil. In fine, he appeals to them, to be judges, whether it
                           be not unbecoming in women to pray without a veil. But he will have men to be uncovered, and not to bear such a mark of subjection,
                           as a veil is, by which a man would dishonour his head, that is, himself, and Christ, who is his head, and who appointed him,
                           when he created him, to be head over the woman. He looks upon it as a dishonour and a disgrace for men to nourish their hair,
                           as women should do. He also calls <I>God the head of Christ,</I> that is, of Christ, as man. Lest he should seem to lessen
                           the condition of women more than necessary, he adds, that the propagation of mankind now depends on the woman, as well as
                           on the man, seeing every <I>man is by the woman.</I> (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           was the custom always to sacrifice to their idols with heads uncovered; amongst the Romans, the opposite was the fashion,

                           this I ordain,</I> &amp;c. St. Paul found that several abuses had crept in among the Corinthians at their Church meetings,
                           where before the holy mysteries (though St. Chrysostom thinks after them) they used to have those <I>charitable suppers,</I>
                           called the <I>Agape.</I> For as our Saviour eat first a common supper with his apostles, before he instituted the holy sacrament,
                           so the Christians in many places brought meats with them, and eat a supper together, in token of that friendship and union,
                           which they had with all their brethren, before they began to celebrate the holy mysteries. It is this supper, which according
                           to the common interpretation St. Paul here (ver. 20.) calls the <I>Lord's supper,</I>[3] (though St. Augustine and some others
                           by the <I>Lord's supper,</I> understand the holy sacrament itself of Christ's body and blood.) The apostle tells them, he
                           <I>hears there are divisions among them</I> at their meetings, which he says will happen, as there <I>must be also heresies,</I>
                           which God permits, that <I>they who are approved, may be made manifest,</I> that is, that on such occasions, the just may
                           shew their fidelity and constancy in their duty to God. The apostle tells them, that <I>it is not now to eat the Lord's supper,</I>
                           that is, there were such abuses among them, that it was not now to imitate the supper, which Christ made with his apostles,
                           or, according to the exposition of St. Augustine, this was not becoming persons, who, before the end of their meetings, were
                           to partake of the divine mysteries. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           must be also heresies:</I> By reason of the pride and perversity of man's heart; not by God's will or appointment; who nevertheless
                           draws good out of this evil, manifesting, by that occasion, who are the good and firm Christians, and making their faith more
                           remarkable. (Challoner) --- Not that God hath directly so appointed, as necessary: this originates in man's malice, and his
                           sole pride, and great abuse of free-will. The providence of God draweth good out of evil, but <I>wo to the man,</I> says the
                           Scripture, <I>by whom scandal cometh,</I> such as sects and heresies. Hence St. Augustine, chap. viii. de vera relig. says:
                           "Let us use heretics not so as to approve their errors, but to make us more wary and vigilant, and more strenuous in defending
                           Catholic doctrine against their deceits."</FONT></P><B>

                           eat with others, and give at that supper: but as soon as some were met (without staying for others, as he orders them, ver.
                           33., when he again speaks of these suppers) the rich placing themselves together, began this supper, and did not take with
                           them their poor brethren, who had brought nothing, or had nothing to bring; by this means, <I>one indeed is hungry, and another
                           is drunk,</I> that is, had at least drunk plentifully, while the poor had nothing but shame, and <I>confusion.</I> By this
                           means of eating and drinking without temperance and moderation, they were by no means disposed to receive afterwards the holy
                           Eucharist. He tells such persons that committed these disorders, that if they be so hungry that they cannot fast, they should
                           eat (ver. 34.) before they come from home. We find these Agape forbidden to be made in the Churches, in the 28th canon of
                           the council of Laodicea, a little before the general council of Nice. In St. Chrysostom's time, and from the first ages[centuries],
                           every one received the sacrament of the holy eucharist fasting, as it is probable this was one of the things which St. Paul
                           gave <I>orders</I> about, (ver. 34.) when he came to Corinth. We must not imagine, that because Christ instituted the holy
                           sacrament, and gave it to his apostles after he had supped with them, that the apostles, or the pastors of the Church, their
                           successors, could not order it to be received <I>fasting,</I> and <I>kneeling,</I> for greater reverence and devotion. See
                           St. Augustine on this same subject, in his letter to Januarius, liv. tom. 2. part 2. p. 126. Nov. edit. He says, that though
                           it is evident the apostles did not receive the body and blood of Christ fasting, yet we must not on that account calumniate,
                           or blame the universal Church, in which it is received only by those who are fasting. He says, it is most insolent madness
                           to dispute against what is a custom in the universal Church. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           as the evangelists had done, and of the real presence of Christ's body and blood. --- <I>Which shall be delivered for you.</I>

                           He puts every one in mind, that whosoever <I>shall eat this bread,</I> (ver. 27.) so called from the outward appearances,
                           <I>or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall,</I> by such a sacrilege, <I>be guilty of the body and of the blood
                           of the Lord.</I> And (ver. 29.) that <I>he eateth, and drinketh judgment,</I> or condemnation <I>to himself, not discerning</I>
                           the difference betwixt celestial food and other meats, and not considering it to be truly <I>the body of the Lord.</I> See
                           St. Chrysostom, hom. xxvii. If the words of our Saviour, <I>this is my body,</I> &amp;c. were to be understood in a <I>metaphorical</I>

                           Gentiles at Corinth, would have used words, which full as clearly express a true and real presence of Christ's body in the
                           eucharist, without one word to signify that this was to be understood in a figurative sense only? (Witham)</FONT></P><B>
