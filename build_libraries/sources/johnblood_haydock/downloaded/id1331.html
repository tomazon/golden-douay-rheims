                                    a reproach to all the nations of the earth?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, and the evils of the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 But we will certainly do every word that shall proceed out of our

                                    kings, and our princes, in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and we were filled with bread, and it was

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 But since we left off to offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And if we offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and pour out drink-offerings
                                    to her: did we make cakes to worship her, to pour out drink-offerings to her, without our husbands?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And Jeremias spoke to all the people, to the men, and to the women,

                                    hath remembered, and hath it not entered into his heart?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 So that the Lord could no longer bear, because of the evil of your

                                    and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Because you have sacrificed to idols, and have sinned against the

                                    therefore are these evils come upon you, as at this day.</font></p>

                                    sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her: you have fulfilled your vows, and have performed

                                    of any man of Juda, in the land of Egypt, saying: The Lord God liveth.</font></p>
