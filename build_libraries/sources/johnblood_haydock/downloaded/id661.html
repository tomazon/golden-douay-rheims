                           Amasa was his nephew, and as he had been appointed general by Absalom, his influence would be the greatest to bring back those
                           who had given into the delusion. A sense of his misconduct would also render him more humble, and easier to manage than Joab,
                           whose insolence caused him to be insupportable to the king. David designed to transfer the authority of the latter, (Calmet)
                           which he had now enjoyed 23 years, since the taking of Sion. David's promise did not oblige him to keep Joab in that office
                           for life, if his conduct should prove unsatisfactory. Hence he appointed Amasa to pursue the rebels, and afterwards Abisai,
                           setting Joab aside. But the haughty warrior supplanted both, and retained the command, as it were in spite of his sovereign,

                           adds, "neither had he cut his nails, nor (made or) dressed his mustaches," or upper lip. The chin, as far as the ears, was
                           not shaved by the Jews. To cut all the hair was a mark of sorrow, no less than to neglect dressing it. See Leviticus xxi.
                           5. (Calmet) --- By the external appearance of Miphiboseth, David might be convinced that he had indulged his grief for a long
                           time; (Menochius) which might serve to remove the ill impressions which he had received against the helpless son of his friend

                           Hebrew adds, "concerning thy affairs. I have said, Thou and Siba divide the inheritance." (Haydock) --- Thou as the owner,
                           Siba as the administrator, or steward, as he was before. (Jun. Malv.[Junius?; Malvenda?]) --- Sanchez thinks that David made
                           a compensation to Miphiboseth, for what he left in the hands of his servant, as he did not wish to disturb the harmony of
                           the day, nor to inflict any punishment on offenders. (Menochius) --- But most interpreters accuse David of injustice, in suffering
                           Siba to reap the fruits of his perfidy, &amp;c. (Salien) (Calmet, &amp;c.) --- It is not probable, however, that he would
                           deviate from his wonted generosity, nor suffer Miphiboseth to be injured, if he were convinced of his innocence. Perhaps he
                           might judge it expedient that Siba should have a separate establishment, as he was now unfit to act in his former capacity,
                           and had shewn some sort of affection towards his sovereign, when his own son, and most of his subjects, had revolted against
                           him. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           others, it was not equal to them all. (Calmet) --- But the disproportion was by no means so great as ten to one; so that the
                           Israelites unjustly pretended, that they had so much greater pretensions to the honour of bringing the king to his capital,
                           in a sort of triumph. David might perhaps have waited a little longer, (Haydock) and shewed less predilection for his own
                           tribe. (Calmet) (Salien) --- But what obligation was there for either? He had been long enough from Jerusalem, and eager to
                           return, as soon as Amasa brought to him the tribe of Juda, and several of Benjamin, ver. 16. What hindered the rest from coming
                           in time? They seem to have pretended more loyalty than they really possessed; otherwise they would not have joined in every
                           rebellion. (Haydock) --- <I>First.</I> Hebrew may be, "did not I first propose the bringing back the king?" ver. 11. (Calmet)

                           repeated the words with indignation, chap. xx. 1. It is wonderful that David did not repress this altercation. Abulensis supposes
                           that he leaned too much towards his own tribe; for which, if true, we behold he was soon chastised; as God is always ready
                           to reward or punish his servants. (Salien) --- But all that David said is not recorded. He could hardly have continued silent.
                           All his endeavours to appease the sedition were, however, rendered abortive, by the evil dispositions of his subjects. (Haydock)</FONT></P><FONT

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 For all of my father's house were no better than worthy of death before

                                    or what right to cry any more to the king?</font></p>

                                    fourscore years old, and he provided the king with sustenance when he abode in the camp: for he was a man exceedingly rich.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And Berzellai said to the king: How many are the days of the years

                                    why should thy servant be a burden to my lord the king?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 I, thy servant, will go on a little way from the Jordan with thee:
                                    I need not this recompense.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 But I beseech thee let thy servant return, and die in my own city,
                                    and be buried by the sepulchre of my father, and of my mother. But there is thy servant Chamaam, let him go with thee, my
                                    lord the king, and do to him whatsoever seemeth good to thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 Then the king said to him: Let Chamaam go over with me, and I will

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 So the king went on to Galgal, and Chamaam with him. Now all the people

                                    to him: Why have our brethren, the men of Juda, stolen thee away, and have brought the king and his household over the Jordan,
                                    and all the men of David with him?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 And all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel: Because the king
                                    is nearer to me: why art thou angry for this matter? have we eaten any thing of the king's, or have any gifts been given us?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said: I have ten
                                    parts in the king more than thou, and David belongeth to me more than to thee: why hast thou done me a wrong, and why was
                                    it not told me first, that I might bring back my king? And the men of Juda answered more harshly than the men of Israel.</font></p>
