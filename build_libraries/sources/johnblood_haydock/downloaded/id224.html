                           of judgment was at hand. The apostle here maintains that it certainly will come, but that it will come like a thief in the
                           night. He says nothing of the time when it is to arrive; he merely refutes those who spoke of its taking place immediately.

                           arms of the Romans. It is true he speaks in many places of the destruction of Jerusalem, and of his coming at the last day,
                           in terms exactly the same. But the context of the whole epistle demonstrates that he is here speaking of the last day. (Calmet)

                           Augustine, writing to Hesychium, declareth that no one from the Scripture can be assured of the day, year, or age[century]
                           when the second coming shall be. (ep. lxxx.) Let us attend to what St. Augustine declares he had learnt from the first Church
                           authorities. At the last judgment, or about that time, will arrive Elias, the Thesbite, the conversion of the Jews, the persecution
                           of antichrist, the coming of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of the dead, the separation of the good from the bad, the conflagration
                           of the world, and the renovation of the same: that these things will arrive, we are to believe, but in what manner and in
                           what order experience will teach better than reason. It is my opinion that they will come in the order I have related them.
                           (De Civ. Dei. lib. xx. cap. ultra) That the man of sin will be born of the Jewish tribe of Dan, that he will cruelly persecute
                           the faithful for three years and a half, that he will put to death Henoch[Enoch] and Elias, and that great, very great, will
                           be the apostacy, is the general belief. Oh! God, preserve us with thy grace, and do not permit us to lose sight of the dreadful
                           danger that threatens even the elect.</FONT></P><B>

                           &amp;c.[2] What is meant by this falling away, (in the Greek this apostacy) is uncertain, and differently expounded. St. Jerome
                           and others understand it of a falling off of other kingdoms, which before were subject to the Roman empire; as if St. Paul
                           said to them: you need not fear that the day of judgment is at hand, for it will not come till other kingdoms, by a general
                           revolt, shall have fallen off, so that the Roman empire be destroyed. The same interpreters expound the sixth and seventh
                           verses in like manner, as if when it is said, <I>now you know</I>[3] <I>what withholdeth,</I> &amp;c. That is, you see the
                           Roman empire subsisteth yet, which must be first destroyed. And when it is added, <I>only that he who now holdeth, do hold,
                           until he be taken out of the way;</I> the sense, say these authors, is, let Nero and his successors hold that empire till
                           it be destroyed, for not till then will the day of judgment come. Cornelius a Lapide makes this exposition so certain, that
                           he calls it a tradition of the fathers, which to him seems apostolical. But we must not take the opinion of some fathers,
                           in the exposition of obscure prophecies, where they advance conjectures (which others at the same time reject, or doubt of)
                           to be apostolical traditions, and articles of faith, as the learned bishop of Meaux, Bossuet, takes notice on this very subject,
                           in his preface and treatise on the Apocalypse, against Jurieux. St. Jerome indeed, and others, thought that the Roman empire
                           was to subsist till the antichrist's coming, which by the event most interpreters conclude to be a mistake, and that it cannot
                           be said the Roman empire continues to this time. See Lyranus on this place, St. Thomas Aquinas, Salmeron, Estius, and many
                           others; though Cornelius a&nbsp;Lapide, with some few, pretend the Roman empire still subsists in the emperors of Germany.
                           We also find that divers of the ancient fathers thought that the day of judgment was just at hand in their time. See Tertullian,
                           St. Cyprian, St. Gregory the Great, &amp;c. And as to this place, it cannot be said the fathers unanimously agree in their
                           exposition. St. Chrysostom[4], Theodoret, St. Augustine in one of his expositions, by this falling off, and apostacy, understand
                           antichrist himself, apostatizing from the Catholic faith. And they who expound it of Nero, did not reflect that this letter
                           of St. Paul was written under Claudius, before Nero's reign. According to a third and common exposition, by this revolt or
                           apostacy, others understand a great falling off of great numbers from the Catholic Church and faith, in those nations where
                           it was professed before; not but that, as St. Augustine expressly takes notice, the Church will remain always visible, and
                           Catholic in its belief, till the end of the world. This interpretation we find in St. Cyril[5] of Jerusalem. (Catech. 15.)
                           See also St. Anselm on this place, St. Thomas Aquinas, Salmeron, Estius, &amp;c. In fine, that there is no apostolical tradition,
                           as to any of the interpretations of these words, we may be fully convinced from the words of St. Augustine[6], lib. xx. de
                           Civ. Dei. chap. 19. t. 7. p. 597. Nov. edit., where he says: <I>For my part, I own myself altogether ignorant what the apostle
                           means by these words; but I shall mention the suspicions of others, which I have read, or heard.</I> Then he sets down the
                           exposition concerning the Roman empire. He there calls that a suspicion and conjecture, which others say is an apostolical
                           tradition. In like manner the ancient fathers are divided, as to the exposition of the words of the sixth and seventh verse,
                           when it is said <I>you know what</I> hindereth; some understand that antichrist must come first. Others, that the beforementioned
                           apostacy, or falling off from the Church, must happen before. And when St. Paul says, (ver. 7.) <I>that he who now holdeth,
                           do hold;</I> some expound it, let him take care at the time of such trials, to hold, and preserve the true faith to the end.
                           When the expositions are so different, as in this place, whosoever pretends to give a literal translation ought never to add
                           words to the text, which determine the sense to such a particular exposition, and especially in the same print, as Mr. N.
                           hath done on the seventh verse, where he translates, <I>only let him that now holdeth the faith, keep it until he be taken
                           out of the way.</I> --- <I>And the man of sin</I>[7] <I>revealed, the son of perdition, so that he sitteth in the temple of
                           God, shewing himself as if he were God.</I> He is called again, (ver. 8.) <I>that wicked one....whom the Lord Jesus Christ
                           shall kill with the spirit of his mouth.</I> By all these words is described to us the great antichrist, about the end of
                           the world, according to the unexceptionable authority and consent of the ancient fathers. It is as ridiculous as malicious
                           to pretend, with divers later reformers, that the pope, and all the popes since the destruction of the Roman empire, are the
                           great antichrist, the man of sin, &amp;c. Grotius, Dr. Hammond, and divers learned Protestants, have confuted and ridiculed
                           this groundless fable, of which more on the Apocalypse. It may suffice to observe here that antichrist, the man of sin, the
                           son of perdition, the wicked one, according to all the ancients,&nbsp;is to be one particular man, not so many different men.
                           That he is to come a little while before the day of judgment. That he will make himself be adored, and pretend to be God.
                           What pope did so? That he will pretend to be Christ, &amp;c. (Witham) --- St. Augustine (de Civ. Dei. book xx. chap. 19.)
                           says, that an attack would be made at one and the same time against the Roman empire and the Church. The Roman empire subsists
                           as yet, in Germany, though much weakened and reduced. The Roman Catholic Church, notwithstanding all its losses, and the apostacy
                           of many of its children, has always remained the same. (Calmet) <SPAN lang=EN>&#8212; </SPAN>The two special signs of the
                           last day will be a general revolt, and the manifestation of antichrist, both of which are so dependent on each other, that
                           St. Augustine makes but one of both. What presumptive folly in Calvin and other modern reformers, to oppose the universal
                           sentiments of the fathers both of the Latin and Greek Church! What inconsistency, to give such forced interpretations, not
                           only widely different from the expositions of sound antiquity, but also widely different from each other! The Church of God,
                           with her head, strong in the promises of Jesus Christ, will persevere to the end, frustra circumlatrantibus hæreticis. (St.
                           Augustine, de util. cred. chap. xvii.) --- <I>In the temple.</I> Either that of Jerusalem, which some think he will rebuild;
                           or in some Christian Church, which he will pervert to his own worship; as Mahomet has done with the churches of the east.

                           antichrist, that man of iniquity, shall be taken away. (Calmet) --- According to others, it is an admonition to the faithful
                           not to be beguiled during this day of trial by such, as under the garb of religion, and with an ostentatious parade of zeal
                           for the holy Scriptures, seek to deceive them. When the mystery of sin shall be revealed, then shall we plainly discover that
                           apostacy from the Catholic Church is the obvious and certain road to a dereliction of all religious principle; yes, to antichristianism
                           and to atheism. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           This is the march of sin, according to St. Thomas Aquinas on this place. In the first place a man, in consequence of his first
                           sin, is deprived of grace, he then falls into further sins, and ends with being eternally punished. Hence it happens that
                           his new sins are a punishment of his former transgressions; because God will permit the devil to do these things. Deus mittet,
                           quia Deus Diabolum facere ista permittet. (St. Augustine, lib. xx. de Civ. Dei. chap. 19.)</FONT></P><B>
