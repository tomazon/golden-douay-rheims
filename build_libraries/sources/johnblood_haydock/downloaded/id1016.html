                                    of Moses, in the hearing of the people: and therein was found written, that the Ammonites and the Moabites should not come
                                    into the church of God for ever:</font></font></p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3"><font size="3">
                                    <p>2 Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and water: and they hired against them Balaam, to curse them:
                                    and our God turned the curse into blessing.</p>
                                    <p>3 And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated every stranger from Israel.</p>
                                    <p>4 And over this thing was Eliasib, the priest, who was set over the treasury of the house of our God, and was near akin
                                    to Tobias.</p>
                                    <p>5 And he made him a great store-room, where before him they laid up gifts, and frankincense, and vessels, and the tithes
                                    of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil, the portions of the Levites, and of the singing men, and of the porters, and the
                                    first-fruits of the priests.</p>
                                    <p>6 But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem, because in the two and thirtieth year* of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon, I
                                    went to the king, and after certain days I asked the king:</p>
                                    <p>7 And I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the evil that Eliasib had done for Tobias, to make him a storehouse in the
                                    courts of the house of God.</p>
                                    <p>8 And it seemed to me exceedingly evil. And I cast forth the vessels of the house of Tobias out of the storehouse.</p>
                                    <p>9 And I commanded, and they cleansed the storehouses: and I brought thither again the vessels of the house of God, the
                                    sacrifice, and the frankincense.</p>
                                    <p>10 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: and that the Levites, and the singing men,
                                    and they that ministered, were fled away, every man to his own country.</p>
                                    <p>11 And I pleaded the matter against the magistrates, and said: Why have we forsaken the house of God? And I gathered them
                                    together, and I made them to stand in their places.</p>
                                    <p>12 And all Juda brought the tithe of the corn, and the wine, and the oil, into the storehouses.</p>
                                    <p>13 And we set over the storehouses Selemias, the priest, and Sadoc, the scribe, and of the Levites, Phadaia, and next to
                                    them Hanan, the son of Zachur, the son of Mathania: for they were approved as faithful, and to them were committed the portions
                                    of their brethren.</p>
                                    <p>14 Remember me, O my God, for this thing, and wipe not out my kindnesses, which I have done relating to the house of my
                                    God, and his ceremonies.</p>
                                    <p>15 In those days I saw in Juda some treading the presses on the sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and lading asses with wine,
                                    and grapes, and figs, and all manner of burthens, and bringing them into Jerusalem on the sabbath-day. And I charged them
                                    that they should sell on a day on which it was lawful to sell.</p>
                                    <p>16 Some Tyrians also dwelt there, who brought fish, and all manner of wares: and they sold them on the sabbaths to the
                                    children of Juda in Jerusalem.</p>
                                    <p>17 And I rebuked the chief men of Juda, and said to them: What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath-day?</p>
                                    <p>18 Did not our fathers do these things, and our God brought all this evil upon us, and upon this city? And you bring more
                                    wrath upon Israel by violating the sabbath.</p>
                                    <p>19 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem were at rest on the sabbath-day, I spoke: and they shut the gates,
                                    and I commanded that they should not open them till after the sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none
                                    should bring in burthens on the sabbath-day.</p>
                                    <p>20 So the merchants, and they that sold all kind of wares, stayed without Jerusalem once or twice.</p>
                                    <p>21 And I charged them, and I said to them: Why stay you before the wall? if you do so another time, I will lay hands on
                                    you. And from that time they came no more on the sabbath.</p>
                                    <p>22 I spoke also to the Levites, that they should be purified, and should come to keep the gates, and to sanctify the sabbath-day:
                                    for this, also, remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>
                                    <p>23 In those days, also, I saw Jews that married wives, women of Azotus, and of Ammon, and of Moab.</p>
                                    <p>24 And their children spoke half in the speech of Azotus, and could not speak the Jews' language, but they spoke according
                                    to the language of this and that people.</p>
                                    <p>25 And I chid them, and laid my curse upon them. And I beat some of them, and shaved off their hair, and made them swear
                                    by God that they would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves,
                                    saying:</p>
                                    <p>26 *Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin in this kind of thing? and surely among many nations, there was not a king like
                                    him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel:** and yet women of other countries brought even
                                    him to sin.</p>
                                    <p>27 And shall we also be disobedient, and do all this great evil, to transgress against our God, and marry strange women?</p>
                                    <p>28 And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliasib, the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanaballet, the Horonite, and
                                    I drove him from me.</p>
                                    <p>29 Remember them, O Lord my God, that defile the priesthood, and the law of priests and Levites.</p>
                                    <p>30 So I separated from them all strangers, and I appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites, every man in his
                                    ministry:</p>
                                    <p>31 And for the offering of wood at times appointed, and for the first-fruits: remember me, O my God, unto good. Amen.</p>
