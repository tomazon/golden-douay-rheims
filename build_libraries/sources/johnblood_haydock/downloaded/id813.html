                           <i>Ezrahite.</i> Septuagint, &amp;c., "<i>Israelite,</i>" as in the former psalm. The Jews think that Ethan or Eman lived
                           during the Egyptian bondage. But this psalm was rather composed by one of the captives at Babylon who bewails the destruction
                           of the kingdom of Juda, under Sedecias. After he had detailed the promises of God, (ver. 39.; Calmet) David might write it
                           in the person (Haydock) of Ethan, or Idithun, 1 Paralipomenon xxv., and 3 Kings. iv. 31. (Worthington) --- Most of the Fathers
                           explain it of Christ's kingdom. See Psalm cxxxi. 11., and Jeremias xxxiii. 17. (Calmet) --- The sceptre or administration
                           of affairs was to continue in the tribe of Juda till his coming, as it really did, though kings were not always at the head
                           of the people. (Berthier)</font></p><b>

                           with Aquila, &amp;c., <i>Dixi.</i> --- <i>Heaven</i> and earth shall pass away sooner than God's word. (Haydock) --- If we

                           never call in question the divine mercy. (Calmet) --- <i>Truth.</i> I will perform what I have promised to thee. (Menochius)
                           --- The apostles, represented by the <i>heavens,</i> have, by their preaching, established by the Church for ever. (Worthington)
                           --- <i>In them,</i> is not in the Septuagint, St. Augustine, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- Houbigant would remove <i>Dixisti,</i> "for
                           thou," &amp;c., to ver. 4. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Generation.</i> David's posterity occupied the throne for a long time, (Haydock) and subsisted till the coming of Christ;
                           so that if any <i>conqueror</i> of that family had then appeared, the Jews would not have hesitated to admit, that this prediction
                           was fulfilled. It is there misfortune to understand the text in this sense, whereas God spoke of the spiritual kingdom of
                           his Son, which is to be perpetual. They can never answer the argument which the Fathers urged in the 4th century, and which
                           has attained fresh strength from the longer duration of misery under which the royal family of David has been depressed. It
                           is plain, that it has enjoyed no power from many ages, and as God's word is invariable, He could not have promised an everlasting
                           earthly dominion. (Berthier) --- The temporal kingdom of David decayed at the captivity, and is now wholly destroyed. But
                           Christ was of this family, and established the Church, his spiritual kingdom, which shall continue unto the end. (Worthington)
                           --- His ministers exercise a power, which is founded on truth and justice. See 2 Kings vii. 9. (Calmet)</font></p><b>
