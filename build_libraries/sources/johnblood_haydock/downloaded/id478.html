                           The five princes, (ver. 8,) had joined Sehon, in his attack upon the Hebrews, Josue xiii. 21. They had united with the Moabites
                           against them, and had been most active in perverting the people of God. They had even the wicked Balaam still among them,
                           who was bent upon destruction; so that God saw the measure of their crimes was full, their provocations unsufferable, and
                           he was pleased to let Moses be witness of their just punishment. This he would effect with a very small force, ver. 5. (Haydock)

                           receive the reward of his pernicious counsel. Thus he was overtaken by God's just judgment, and he fell into the pit which
                           his avarice had dug for him, chap. xxiv. 25. (Haydock) --- Probably he was busy with his incantations; for this sort of men

                           among their fellow soldiers, when they were met by Moses, &amp;c., who came to congratulate with them, and to examine how

                           had rendered themselves unworthy of such indulgence, (Calmet) and the sight of them raised the just indignation of Moses,

                           who by the counsel of Balaam, had sent their women amongst the Israelites on purpose to draw them from God. (Challoner) ---
                           Only those who were under twelve would be thus reserved; and as their tender minds might yet receive the impressions of virtue,
                           by a proper education, they might, one day, be married by some of the Hebrews. The boys were all slain, either because they
                           might be inclined to resent the injury done to their relations, or because they were all consecrated to Beelphegor; the first-born
                           to be his priests, the rest to be victims, if necessary, to avert any evil. For "the heathens in cold blood," says Paine,
                           "offered their children in sacrifice to Baalpeor." It was on this account, that the killing of all the first-born in Egypt,
                           was felt so terribly, as the people could not lawfully approach their gods. (Forbes) --- Moses did not reserve the girls for
                           the purpose of debauchery, as Paine ignorantly pretends; for that was contrary to his own laws, nor did he wantonly kill the
                           innocent, which he also strictly forbade, and which he would have been still more afraid to do, if he had been an impostor.
                           But he preserved the lives of those girls who might be presumed innocent, and who might live to do good, while he took <I>the

                           Those who had been in battle, had about a 50th part more than the rest. They gave the first-fruits to the priests, while those
                           in the camp presented theirs to the Levites. Other rules were afterwards observed. See 1 Kings xxx. 24., and 2 Machabees viii.
                           28. The Rabbins assign the greatest share to the king, (Selden, Jur. vi. 16,) and Homer gives the largest portion to the general;
                           after which the rest was equally divided, and even the absent partook. The gods were not forgotten. So also among the Hebrews,
                           Syrians, &amp;c., the general make an equal division. David assigns a part of the booty for sacred uses, 1 Paralipomenon xxvi.
