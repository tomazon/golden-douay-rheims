                           dispersed.</I> During this great persecution of the Church, those who could not conceal themselves, were dispersed into different
                           countries. Thus did the Almighty make use of the malice of his enemies, to the greater exaltation and glory of his own name.
                           For those who fled, carried with them the light of the gospel, wherever they went. (Tirinus) --- They were burning torches,
                           which communicated of their holy fire to every place, in which they were scattered. (St. Augustine, Serm. cxvi.) --- Thus
                           was the gospel disseminated from Jerusalem into all Judea and Samaria. --- <I>And Samaria.</I> Though our Saviour in his life
                           time had forbid them to preach to the Samaritans, (Matthew x. 5.) they now knew that the time of that precept was past. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           care.</I> In an ancient work, which gives the history of the finding of St. Stephen's body, generally considered authentic,
                           and printed at the end of the 7th volume of St. Augustine's works, we find the following account. "Stephen having been stoned
                           without the northern gate, lay there without burial one day and a night, according to the order of the Jewish rulers, that
                           his body might become a prey to birds and beasts, but God did not suffer either to touch it." --- "Then I, Gamaliel, compassionating
                           these servants of Jesus Christ, and desiring to have some share in the faith and religion of this holy man, sent among the
                           Jews some Christians who feared God, dwelling at Jerusalem, to take away privately the body, and bring it in my chariot to
                           my country house, where it was deposited in my tomb towards the east, and we mourned over it for forty days," &amp;c. It is
                           an injury to pray for a martyr, who ought to assist us by his prayers. (St. Augustine, Serm. xvii.) --- We see great devotion
                           used in burying his body, and four centuries afterwards, at the finding and translating thereof. Very many miracles were performed
                           on that occasion, as St. Augustine witnesses in his work de Civitate Dei, lib. xxii. chap. 8., and Serm. de S. Steph. T. viii.</FONT></P><B>

                           says St. Augustine. He wished to imitate the prodigies of the apostles, but loved not their justice, nor the truth they preached.
                           He entered into the Church, and desired baptism, not to obtain the grace of justification, but to have an occasion of extolling
                           himself. He wished to walk in wonders above himself. (In Psalm cxxx.)</FONT></P><B>

                           for that they had received at baptism; but the spirit of strength, to confess with confidence and freedom the name of Jesus,
                           and the supernatural and miraculous graces, usually at that time granted to the faithful, by the imposition of hands. Philip
                           did not administer the sacrament, because he could not; he was not a bishop. Hence now in the Church, we see only the chief
                           pastors do it, præcipuos et non alios videmus hoc facere. See St. Chrysostom, hom. xviii. in Acta. --- There is no mention
                           here, it is true, of unction, but the most venerable antiquity clearly specifies it. St. Cyprian, in the third age [third
                           century], says: "it is moreover necessary, that he who has been baptized, should be anointed, that having received the chrism,
                           that is, the unction, he may be the anointed of God." (Ep. lxx.) --- In the next age [fourth century], St. Pacianus writes:
                           "Do you say that this (the power of remitting sins) was granted only to the apostles? Then I say, that they alone could baptize,
                           and give the Holy Spirit, for to them alone was the command of doing it given. If, therefore, the right of conferring baptism,
                           and of anointing, descended to their successors, to them also has come the power of binding and loosing." (Ep. i. ad Sym.
                           Bibl. Max. T. iv. p. 307)</FONT></P><B>

                           things. It was vanity that made Simon desire this power. (Witham) --- Hence to give or receive money in exchange, or as a
                           price for any spiritual good whatever, is justly esteemed sinful. It is called simony, from the name of the person, who was
                           first engaged in this sin. (Haydock) --- Simon acts the part of a tempter to the apostles, and wishes to draw them into prevarication,
                           by offering money for what was above all price, and of what they were not the proprietors, but the dispensers. (St. Clement

                           give him repentance; but that the evils might not fall upon him. In this he is a true model of false penitents, who hate not
                           the sin, but fear the punishment, which is the consequence of it. He afterwards left the East, and went to Rome, under the
                           reign of Claudius. Sts. Justin, Irenæus, and others say, the senate adored him as a divinity. Having undertaken to fly in
                           the air, in the presence of the emperor and senate, when he had raised himself to a certain height, he was brought down by
                           the prayers of Sts. Peter and Paul, and died a few days after, of the wounds he received by the fall. (Calmet) --- See also

                           take good notice of these words, not to wrest the Scriptures to his own perdition. To follow his own private judgment, or
                           his private spirit, is to make choice of a blind and incompetent guide, as to the sense of the Scriptures, and the mysteries
                           of faith. See the preface to the gospel of St. John. (Witham) --- It appears this eunuch was not one of those, who are now
                           so commonly seen, who think the Scripture is every where plain, and the sense open to every body. Such would do much better
                           to acknowledge, that they stand in need of a guide. (Grotius, hic.) --- St. Jerome, in his letter to Paulinus, printed at
                           the head of the Latin Bibles, shews the necessity of an interpreter. The apostles themselves could not understand the Scriptures
                           till Christ gave them the knowledge; tunc aperuit illis sensum ut intelligerent scripturas. (Luke xxiv. 45.)</FONT></P><B>

                           as here a sorrow for sins, a firm hope, love of God, &amp;c. (Witham) --- Faith is thus seen to be a necessary predisposition
