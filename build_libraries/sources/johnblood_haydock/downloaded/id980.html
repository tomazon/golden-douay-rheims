                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 Amasias, therefore, gathered Juda together, and appointed them by families,
                                    and captains of thousands, and of hundreds in all Juda, and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and upwards,
                                    and found three hundred thousand young men that could go out to battle, and could hold the spear and shield.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 He hired also of Israel a hundred thousand valiant men, for a hundred

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 But a man of God came to him, and said: O king, let not the army of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And Amasias said to the man of God: What will then become of the hundred

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 But that army which Amasias had sent back, that they should not go
                                    with him to battle, spread themselves among the cities of Juda, from Samaria, to Bethhoron, and having killed three thousand,
                                    took away much spoil.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 But Amasias, after he had slain the Edomites, set up the gods of the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Wherefore the Lord being angry against Amasias, sent a prophet to
                                    him, to say to him: Why hast thou adored gods that have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And when he spoke these things, he answered him: Art thou the king's
                                    counsellor? be quiet, lest I kill thee. And the prophet departing, said: I know that God is minded to kill thee, because thou
                                    hast done this evil, and moreover hast not hearkened to my counsel.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Then Amasias, king of Juda, taking very bad counsel, sent to Joas,
                                    the son of Joachaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying: Come, let us see one another.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 But he sent back the messengers, saying: The thistle that is in Libanus
                                    sent to the cedar in Libanus, saying: Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and behold the beasts that were in the wood of
                                    Libanus, passed by, and trod down the thistle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 Thou hast said: I have overthrown Edom, and therefore thy heart is
                                    lifted up with pride: stay at home; why dost thou provoke evil against thee, that both thou shouldst fall and Juda with thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 Amasias would not hearken to him, because it was the Lord's will that
                                    he should be delivered into the hands of enemies, because of the gods of Edom.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 So Joas, king of Israel, went up, and they presented themselves to

                                    he brought back to Samaria.</font></p>
