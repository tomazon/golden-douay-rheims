                           (chap. xxix. 42.; Haydock); and most people suppose, that it was placed out of the holy of holies, beside the veil. The golden
                           censer, which St. Paul (Hebrews ix. 4,) tells us was within, might be that of Aaron, which was placed there after the sedition
                           of Core, (Numbers xvi.) or one that might be left smoking before the ark, on the day of expiation. (Calmet) --- St. Augustine,
                           &amp;c., believe, however, that it was in the holy of holies. (q. 133.; Origen, hom. 19.; St. Gregory; 1 Kings xiv.; &amp;c.)</FONT></P><B>

                           David perhaps neglected this injunction. (2 Kings xxiv; Josephus, Antiquities vii. 10.) Yet we do not read that Moses took
                           the half sicle when he numbered the people, Numbers i. Whence others gather, that this sum was to be paid every year, as it
                           was done in our Saviour's time, for the support of the temple, Matthew xvii. 23. Vespasian ordered the Jews to pay the same
                           money for the capitol. (Josephus, Jewish Wars vii. 13.) After the captivity, the third part of a sicle was demanded, 2 Esdras
                           x. 32. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           measures, 1 Paralipomenon xxiii. 29. The Egyptians and Romans took the like precaution to prevent any fraud; and Justinian
                           required that such things should be kept in churches. Some have supposed, that the royal or common sicle was less than that
                           of the sanctuary. But Moses admits of no distinction. (Leviticus xxvii. 25.; Ezechiel xlv. 12.) Perhaps the weights of the
                           Egyptians, &amp;c., might differ from this, which Moses therefore particularizes so well. (Calmet) --- Arbuthnot makes the
                           weight of the sicle equal to 9 dwt. 2,57 gr. English Troy weight; and he values that of silver at 2s. 3,375d. sterling. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           The priests went barefoot in the tabernacle. In the Misna we find the same law binds laymen. None were allowed to enter the
