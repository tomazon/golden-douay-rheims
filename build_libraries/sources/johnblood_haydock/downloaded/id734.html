                           his Son, Christ, the conqueror of death and hell, principally in view, as this psalm sings of victory over nations. His incarnation
                           and the afflictions of Christians are hidden in God. (Worthington) --- <i>Lamnatseach</i> has generally a preposition, <i>l,

                           Catholics and Protestants. The Jews agree with neither. Some unite the 1st and 2nd, as Kimchi does the 114th and 115th. (Amama)

                                    <p>2 I will give praise to thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will relate all thy wonders.</p>
                                    <p>3 I will be glad, and rejoice in thee: I will sing to thy name, O thou most high.</p>
                                    <p>4 When my enemy shall be turned back: they shall be weakened, and perish before thy face.</p>
                                    <p>5 For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause: thou hast sat on the throne, who judgest justice.</p>
                                    <p>6 Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the wicked one hath perished; thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.</p>
                                    <p>7 The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities thou hast destroyed.</p>
                                    <p>Their memory hath perished with a noise: 8 But the Lord remaineth for ever.</p>
                                    <p>He hath prepared his throne in judgment: 9 and he shall judge the world in equity, he shall judge the people in justice.</p>
                                    <p>10 And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor: a helper in due time in tribulation.</p>

                                    <p>9(30) His eyes are upon the poor man: he lieth in wait, in secret, like a lion in his den.</p>

                                    <p>12(33) Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor.</p>
                                    <p>13(34) Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said in his heart: He will not require <i>it</i>.</p>
                                    <p>14(35) Thou seest <i>it</i>, for thou considerest labour and sorrow: that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands.</p>

                                    <p>16(37) The Lord shall reign to eternity, yea, for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish from his land.</p>
