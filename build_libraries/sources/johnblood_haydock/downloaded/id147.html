                           <i>What advantage then? </i>&amp;c. The apostle, not to offend the Jews, by insisting too long in reprehending them, turns
                           his discourse to the advantages they have hitherto had above other nations. As <i>first,</i> that the <i>words of God,</i>
                           those divine oracles, revelations, promises in the Scriptures, were credited or intrusted to them. And though <i>some,</i>
                           or many of them have <i>not believed</i> God's promises, especially concerning their Messias; this hath not hindered <i>God
                           from </i>being <i>faithful</i> to his word, in sending the Messias, and those blessings that were promised with him. <i>For
                           God</i> is always <i>true,</i> or <i>faithful</i> in his promises, and therefore must needs <i>be justified,</i> or found
                           just, when his proceedings are judged, that is, considered and examined. (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           <i>God </i>only <i>is</i> essentially <i>true.</i> All men in their own capacity are liable to lies and errors: nevertheless
                           God, who is the <i>truth,</i> will make good his promise of keeping his Church in all <i>truth.</i> See St. John, xvi. 13.
                           (Challoner) --- The Greek text has, "may God be true;" that is, may all men acknowledge him as such; let the whole world know,
                           that he neither can be unfaithful to his word, nor his promises; and that, on the contrary, all men of themselves have but
                           lies and vanity for their portion. --- <i>That thou mayest be justified,</i> &amp;c. The particle <i>that,</i> is not casual
                           in this place, but only marks the event. Thy conduct shews that thou art faithful and true to thy promises, and that, notwithstanding
                           the judgments of men, thou art always unchangeable and infallible. Thou art victorious, when judged by them; thou shewest
                           them the falsity and injustice of their judgments. (Calmet) --- And that the infidelity of man, so far from affecting the
                           fidelity of God, will only serve to set it off in a more striking and clearer light. (Bible de Vence)</font></p><b>

                           <i>But if our injustice,</i> &amp;c. St. Paul here puts this objection, that if men's sins and iniquities, <i>make the justice
                           of God commendable,</i> that is, make his justice more apparent and known; if the <i>truth of God,</i> as to his promises,
                           be more discovered, praised, and glorified by our <i>lies,</i> that is, by our sins, how then can God blame, or punish men
                           for sins, which contribute more to his honour? May we not say, (as some falsely pretend St. Paul said) <i>let us do evil things,
                           that good things may come of them?</i> The apostle answers in short both this objection, and the calumny against him. As to
                           the first; that though men's sins give an occasion to God to shew his justice, and make known his divine perfections, yet
                           this will not excuse them from being justly condemned, and punished, when God shall judge the wicked world; for if that were
                           a sufficient plea, God <i>could not judge</i> and condemn the wicked: so that as St. Chrysostom [1] observes, the apostle
                           resolves their question, by asking another, and shews their reasoning absurd, by taking notice of another absurdity that follows
                           from it. 2ndly. He tells them, they slander him, and his doctrine, by only telling them, they deserve to <i>be condemned</i>
                           who say, <i>let us do evil that good may come of it: the damnation,</i> he says,<i> of such men is just.</i> (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           Gentiles: this he proves out of the psalms; and (ver. 19.) he shews, that these things were spoken <i>of them,</i> who were
                           <i>under the law.</i> (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           <i>There is not any man just,</i> viz. by virtue either of the law of nature, or of the law of Moses; but only by faith and
                           grace. (Challoner) --- The apostle here adduces a series of passages from the ancient Scripture, to convince both Jews and
                           Gentiles, that not one amongst them was just, nor had any title to glory, on account of his good works. Not that a just man
                           could not be found under the old law, or even before the law; an infinite number of passages of Scripture will shew the contrary:
                           but he must be understood as speaking of man left to himself, as a son of Adam, conceived in sin, and brought forth a child
                           of wrath. (Calmet) --- These crimes, enumerated by the apostle, are not mentioned as if found in each individual, but some
                           of this black catalogue of crimes were found in one man; some in another; yet so that all had become infected with sin and
                           iniquity, all had deserted the path of virtue. There was none just, none found, who feared or sought after God. (Estius) ---
                           These texts of Scripture, though formerly, even before the times of St. Jerome and St. Augustine, they were found together
                           in some Latin editions, viz. Psalm xiii. cannot be found united either in the Hebrew text, or Septuagint version, as St. Jerome
                           affirms, in Præf. lib. xvi. commentar. in Isai. This, he says, all the Greek commentators allow. He says, that those who were
                           ignorant of this apostle's art in uniting together the texts of different pasts of Scripture, upon finding no part where they
                           were all together, placed them, without any authority, in that psalm whence the first part of the citation is taken. The words,
                           <i>an open sepulchre,</i> are taken from Psalm xiii. (Hebrew text xiv.) the verse "Their throat is an open sepulchre, with
                           their tongues they have dealt deceitfully," from Psalm v. "The venom of asps is under their lips," from Psalm cxxxix. "Whose
                           mouth is full of curses and bitterness," from Psalm ix. "Their feet are swift," &amp;c. as far as, <i>there is no fear,</i>

                           <i>And all the world may be made subject to God.</i> That is, God permitted these sins in all men, that sanctification and
                           salvation might be from Christ only, the Redeemer of all men, so that neither Jew nor Gentile should be justified, but by
                           the free and liberal gift of his grace. See St. Chrysostom.[2] (Witham) --- T<span lang="EN">hat the Jews might not say that
                           these passages were to be understood of Gentiles, the apostle here assures them that they must be understood in the first
                           place of the Jews themselves; for what the law speaketh, it speaketh to those who are under the law. If the Jews, then, were
                           so guilty, the guilt of the Gentiles was far more enormous. Thus is every mouth stopped, and all the world must confess itself
                           guilty before God. Let none then glory in their good works. (Calmet)</span></font></p><b>

                           size="3"> To the end of this chapter, the apostle shews that the Jews cannot be truly justified, and sanctified by the <i>works
                           of the </i>written <i>law</i> of Moses only; that <i>a knowledge of sin,</i> or of what is sinful, came <i>by the law,</i>
                           but if they did not comply with the precepts of the law, this knowledge made them more guilty. Now, at the coming of Christ,
                           the <i>justice of God,</i> that is, the justice by which he made others just, and justified them, cannot be had without <i>faith
                           in Christ,</i> and by the grace of our Redeemer Jesus Christ, whom God hath <i>proposed</i> to all, both Gentiles and Jews,
                           as a sacrifice of[3] <i>propitiation</i> for the sins of all mankind, by <i>faith in his blood;</i> that is, by believing
                           in him, who shed his blood and died for us on the cross. It is he alone, (ver. 26.) that is <i>the just one,</i> and the <i>justifier</i>
                           of all. And as to this, <i>there is no distinction.</i> The Gentiles are <span lang="EN">justified and sanctified without
                           the written law, and the Jews who have been under the law, cannot partake of <i>the justice of God,</i> that is, cannot be
                           justified,</span> sanctified, or saved, but by the faith and grace of Christ Jesus. St. Paul does not pretend that the virtue
                           of faith alone will justify and save a man; nothing can be more opposite to the doctrine of the gospel, and of the apostles
                           in many places, as hath been observed, and will be shewn hereafter. He tells us in this chapter (ver. 20. and 28.) that man
                           is justified <i>without the works of the</i> written <i>law:</i> and he teaches us, that no works of the law of Moses, nor
                           any works that a man does by the law of nature, are sufficient to justify a man, and save him of themselves, that is, unless
                           they be joined with faith, and the grace of God. And when he seems to say, that men are justified or saved by faith, or by
                           believing, as he says of Abraham in the next chapter, (ver. 3. and 5.) he never says (as some both ancient and later heretics
                           have pretended) that <i>faith alone</i> is sufficient. And besides by faith, he understands the Christian faith and doctrine
                           of Christ, as opposite to the law of Moses, to circumcision, and the ceremonies of that law, as it evidently appears by the
                           design of the apostle, both in this epistle and in that to the Galatians. He teaches us in this epistle (chap. ii. 6.) that
                           God will judge every man <i>according to his works:</i> (chap. ii. 13.) that "not the hearers of the law," but <i>the doers,
                           shall be justified.</i> See also chap. vi. He tells the Galatians (chap. v. ver. 6.) that the faith, by which they must be
                           saved, must be a faith working by charity. He also tells the Corinthians (1 Corinthians vii. 19.) that <i>circumcision is
                           nothing, nor uncircumcision, </i>but the keeping of the commandments of God. That though a man should have a faith, that so
                           he could remove mountains, it would avail him nothing without charity. How often does he tell us that they who commit such
                           and such sins, shall not inherit or possess the kingdom of God? Does not St. James tell us, that faith without good <i>works
                           is dead?</i> See chap. ii. Of this more hereafter. (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           6. cap. viii. "When the apostle says, that a man is <i>justified</i> by faith, and gratis, according to the perpetual consent
                           of the Catholic Church, we are said to be justified by faith, because faith is the beginning and foundation of man's salvation,
                           and the root of his justification, without which we cannot please God, nor be made his sons; and we are said to be justified
                           gratis, because nothing of those things which go before justification, whether faith or works, are meritorious of the grace

                           Christians are now taught to fulfil the moral precepts, and the chief part of the law, with greater perfection, in the spirit
