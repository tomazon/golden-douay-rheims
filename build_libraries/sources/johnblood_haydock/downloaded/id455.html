                           This candlestick stood on the south side, with one branch extending towards the altar of incense, on the east; and the other
                           to the west, so as to give light to the loaves of proposition, on the north, Exodus xxv. 31. (Calmet) --- It was intended
                           to illumine the holy of holies, where a sort of feast was prepared for God, and where no windows were found. (Menochius) ---

                           xix.) appointed for purifying all that were unclean. It was a figure of the blood of Christ, applied to our souls by his holy
                           sacraments. (Challoner) --- <I>Purification,</I> (<I>lustrationis</I>) or "expiation." The water, mixed with ashes, was taken
                           and sprinkled round about the houses, and upon those persons who wished either to be cleansed from some defilement, or to
                           advance in virtue and purity. We use salt instead of ashes. Theocritus (Idyl. xxiv. 100,) puts these words in the mouth of
                           Tiresias, "then mixt with salt, according to the law, with a green branch sprinkle the honoured and pure water, and sacrifice

                           of solicitude." See Leviticus xiv. 8., and xxi. 5, 10. (Haydock) --- The priests serving in the temple were obliged to cut
                           their hair every month; and the Levites probably observed the same regulation, to acknowledge, that they who approach to&nbsp;God,
                           must be pure and detached from earthly cares, (Calmet) and particularly from the works of sin; to remind them of which, they
                           were to be sprinkled with water, their garments washed, and they were to offer two oxen by the hands of Aaron, and to be lifted
                           up or offered to God, to serve in his court. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>
