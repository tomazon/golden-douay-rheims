                           sin committed, be entirely blotted out." (Aldus; Usher) --- They were convinced that some sins might be forgiven in the other
                           world, particularly when the living interceded. (Calmet) --- The Jews began to pray for the dead after the captivity, (Grotius)
                           when the prophets had more clearly explained what took place after death. (Calmet) --- Yet the doctrine and practice might
                           still be as ancient as the world. (Haydock) --- If it had not prevailed before, Judas would never have entertained such sentiments.
                           (Worthington) --- The Jews admit a sort of purgatory for "the prevaricators of Israel," which differs from hell only in duration.
                           They assert that the damned of their nation are exempt from suffering on the sabbath. (Bartolocci; Leo v. 10.; Tirinus; Estius)
                           --- Some Christians have supposed that the sin here specified was mortal, and the deceased in hell, yet prayer might be of
                           service to them. Origen (Prin. iii. 6.) thought that even the devils would one day be liberated. St. Augustine (Ench. cx.
                           29.) says prayers "are of service, either that the remission may be entire, or surely that damnation itself may be more tolerable."
                           Most understand this of purgatory: but several explain it of the damned. (Rrot. Bened.) --- A mass was formerly composed for
                           this purpose, <i>tolerabilia fiant ipsa tormenta:</i> and some monks prayed for certain robbers slain, "that their pains might
                           be diminished by the severe judge." (Aldrev. xxi) Excommunication might be taken off from the deceased. (St. Gregory, Dial.
                           ii. 29.) --- Purgatory is for venial sins. (Ibid.[St. Gregory, Dial.] iv. 39.) This doctrine is proved beyond reply by various
                           controvertists. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Twelve.</i> Greek, "two." Syriac, "three." St. Prosper. reads "12,000 talents." Sacrifices for the dead were not enjoined,
                           but the practice was then established, and this author takes every opportunity of proving the resurrection against the Sadducees,
                           who then began to appear. The Church of Christ has adopted the same practice. See Bellarmine, Serarius, &amp;c. Our adversaries
                           confess that such was the opinion of the Jews, and of the ancient doctors of the Church. But they declare it superstitious,
                           and deny the authority of these books, which has been sufficiently established. Could such holy personages authorize superstition?
                           Would Christ and his apostles have tolerated it? St. Paul prayed for Onesiphorus after his decease, 2 Timothy i. 16. See Matthew
                           xii. 33., and Luke xvi. 9., and 1 Corinthians iii. 13., and xv. 29.; Eusebius, Life of Constantine iv.; St. Epiphanius, hær.

                           the bishops of France, that those who died fighting against infidels were saved. (Mabil. T. iii. An. Ben.) --- Judas might
                           entertain the like hopes, though they are not always well grounded. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           as the Vulgate, (Worthington) <b>45.</b> "considering that the best grace is laid up for those who sleep in piety. Holy and

                           be delivered from sin," or punishment due to it. (Worthington) --- Sin is often taken for the punishment; and this effect
                           of mortal sin may be remitted in purgatory, when the person has sincerely repented in this life. (Haydock) --- To pass over
                           other proofs, we will only mention St. Augustine (hær. liii.) and St. Bernard, (Cant. lxvi.) who plainly account those "heretics,"
                           who deny purgatory. It is also worthy of notice that Judas, who acted thus charitably, was the high priest and defender of
                           the true faith; and that the Jews still pray for the dead, as the book <i>Mahzor,</i> published by Genebrard, 1569, evinces.
                           There they say, "Let him rest in peace," and "ye angels of peace come forth to meet him." But this is acknowledged by Munster

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 Then Judas went away to Carnion, where he slew five and twenty thousand

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 They gave them thanks, exhorting them to be still friendly to their

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 And after Pentecost they marched against Gorgias, the governor of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And he came out with three thousand footmen, and four hundred horsemen.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And when they had joined battle, it happened that a few of the Jews
                                    were slain.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 But Dositheus, a horseman, one of Bacenor's <i>band</i>, a valiant

                                    cut off his shoulder: and so Gorgias escaped to Maresa.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 But when they that were with Esdrin had fought long, and were weary,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 Then beginning in his own language, and singing hymns with a loud
                                    voice, he put Gorgias's soldiers to flight.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 So Judas having gathered together his army, came into the city Odollam:
                                    and when the seventh day came, they purified themselves according to the custom, and kept the sabbath in the same place.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 And the day following Judas came with his company, to take away the

                                    sin which had been committed might be forgotten. But the most valiant Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin,
                                    forasmuch as they saw before their eyes what had happened, because of the sins of those that were slain.</font></p>
