                           entwined with ivy, &amp;c.; Calmet) in her hands, and gave to those women who accompanied her; and they crowned with olive
                           both her and her attendant; (<i>maid,</i> or Alexandrian Septuagint, "and she was crowned with olive, and her mule;" Grabe
                           substitutes "female companions,") and she went before all the people, leading the dance of all the women; and every man of
                           Israel followed in arms, with crowns, and with hymns in their mouth. Then," &amp;c., chap. xvi. (Haydock) --- The bearing
                           of green branches, on such occasions, was very common, Leviticus xxiii. 40., 2 Machabees x. 7., and Matthew xxi. 8. Hence
                           Tacitus (Hist. v.) supposed that the Jews adored Bacchus. But there was nothing here of the immodesty, which generally attended
                           the pagan festivals. We only find this instance of women being crowned with olive. But this tree was very proper, as it was
                           used in rejoicings: <i>Ramo felicis olivæ;</i> (Virgil vi.) on which Servius remarks, <i>olivæ, arboris festæ.</i> At certain
                           races in Greece, women who gained the victory, were thus crowned; (Alex. Genial v. 8.) and it was used by the Roman cavalry
                           on the ides of July, and in ovations. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xv. 4.) --- The processions of the Church often admit of
                           similar ornaments in honour of God, (Tirinus) and to promote piety. (Haydock)</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>
