                           himself down on the shore of the sea of Galilee, where multitudes crowded unto him.</FONT></P><B>

                           he spoke many things, from a ship, in parables; probably many more than are here recorded. By familiar and well-known objects,
                           Jesus Christ would thus convey more pleasingly his divine instructions, and teach them to spiritualize their daily labours,
                           and by natural things, which meet the senses, lead them to the knowledge of things divine, which we cannot naturally comprehend.
                           (Haydock) --- Several reasons may be assigned why our Lord made use of parables: 1st. The lively imagination of the Orientals
                           made them relish these figurative expressions, which awaken the attention, and exercise the understanding. 2d. The indisposition
                           of his hearers made him frequently veil his instructions under similitudes or parables; but in private, he expounded the meaning
                           to his disciples, who were better disposed, and was ever ready to give every necessary and satisfactory explanation to as
                           many as sincerely wished for it. --- A third motive, given by St. Matthew, was the accomplishment of the prophecies; for one
                           of the characteristics of the Messias was, that he would express himself in this parabolical manner; and Jesus Christ was
                           pleased that the most minute circumstances should be fulfilled in his person, in order that the resemblance between him and
                           the ancient prophets, in the mode of instructing, might induce the Jews to consider him as the great prophet, foretold by
                           Moses. There are few Christians that do not dwell with delight and improvement on our Lord's parables. Their imagination,
                           warmed with the singular beauty of the imagery, more easily retains them; and the greatest geniuses have ever esteemed them
                           as very superior and striking lessons of <I>morality</I> and <I>religion.</I> --- In his sermon on the mount, Jesus Christ
                           does not make use of parables to convey his instructions to the Jews, for then his auditors were composed of a mixed multitude,
                           and the major part of them illiterate people; but here, on the contrary, they are the Scribes and Pharisees, the doctors of
                           the law. (St. Chrysostom) --- Jesus Christ speaks sometimes in plain, and sometimes in obscure terms, that, by what they understand,
                           they may be led to the search of what they do not understand. (St. Jerome)</FONT></P><B>

                           whilst he soweth.</I> St. Matthew and St. Mark subjoin the following parables to what goes before, but St. Luke places the
                           parable of the <I>sower</I> immediately after the second journey through Galilee, which he anticipates. Jesus Christ successively
                           proposed four parables to the people, and then dismissed them; and being now retired with his disciples, he unfolded to them
                           the meaning of the parables when in the house. (ver. 36) St. Matthew, however, interrupts the course of the parables, and
                           after the first, anticipates the request of the disciples to have it explained; but from St. Mark, we learn that this did
                           not take place till Christ was alone in the house. Of the eight parables, all spoken by Jesus on the same day, the first five
                           were addressed to the people assembled on the sea-shore, the other three were added by him when alone with the apostles in
                           the house, and are in some measure explanations of the former. In the first, we see the different success of the word of God
                           from the different dispositions of the hearers. And as we find that only one-fourth part of the seed produced fruit, we may
                           thence infer how many and great are the obstacles in the way of salvation, and how few will be the number of the elect. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>He that hath ears to hear.</I> By these words, we are exhorted to examine the meaning of the parables. (St. Jerome) See
                           Chap. xi. 15. --- We are also taught that not all, but only such as have had the sense of the Scriptures opened to their understanding
                           from above, can properly understand them. The apostles themselves were in ignorance till Jesus Christ gave them the true meaning:
                           aperuit illis sensum, ut intelligerent Scripturas: "he opened their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures."
                           (St. Luke xxiv. 45.) It is God who speaketh in the Scripture, and it is God who giveth us to understand what is therein delivered.
                           His truths he conceals from the proud, while he reveals them to the little and humble. How can any persons pretend that the
                           most mysterious, as well as the most sacred book in the world, is open to every understanding? St. Paul (Acts xiii. 26.) tells
                           the Jews, that although the Scriptures were read to them every sabbath-day, their very rulers did not understand them; and
                           St. Peter, in his 2d Epistle (2 Peter iii. 17.) assures us, that there are many passage hard to be understood. --- All comes
                           from God. It is He who openeth our ears to hear, our heart to believe, and our mind to understand. Agar was near a well, and
                           yet she wept, because she had no water to give her son to drink.&nbsp; God opened her eyes, and she saw the well that was
                           close to her. Thus, says Origen, we may read the Scripture, and find no nourishment for the soul, unless God opens our mind,
                           to see therein on what we are to nourish it. It contains salutary waters, but only those can be benefited by them, who see
                           how to drink of the heavenly source. It is the Holy Ghost alone who can effectually open our eyes, to see these waters that
                           spring up to life eternal; and this special grace we are to obtain by humble and fervent prayer. <I>Knock, and it shall be
                           opened to you.</P></I></FONT></FONT><B>

                           he may disclose to us the mysteries of his gospel. (St. Thomas Aquinas) --- Can we then suppose, for a single moment, that
                           the mere putting of a Bible into every man's hand, will convert the world. The command given to the apostles and their successors
                           in the ministry is, <I>Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,</I> &amp;c. <I>teaching
                           them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And lo, I am with you all days, even to the end of the world.</I>
                           (St. Matthew xxviii. 20). There is not a single word to them about <I>writing.</I> During 2,500 years, from Adam to Moses,
                           were the patriarchal families and other servants of God in a state of ignorance, concerning either the positive instructions
                           of the Almighty respecting the sabbath-day, the rites of sacrifice, or their moral duties? Yet there was no Scripture during
                           all that period. For more than 400 years after Jesus Christ, the canon of Scripture, as now generally received by Protestants,
                           remained unsettled. Had the apostles and evangelists done nothing more than publish their writings, and disseminate them to
                           every pagan country, not a single nation, not a single pagan, would have abandoned their gods to believe in a crucified Jesus.

                           of God. For, as St. Augustine observes, they who have received graces and favours from God, and have not made good use and

                           shall even be deprived of the benefits they now possess. Thus the Jews were deprived of their temple, priesthood, kingdom,
                           and even the true worship of God. (St. Jerome) --- They rejected Jesus Christ, the fountain and corner-stone of virtue; all
                           therefore they had acquired, or possessed, shall be taken from them, and given to the apostles. (St. Jerome) --- Whoever has
                           a desire of complying with the divine precepts, that desire shall not only be increased, but all other virtues shall be added
                           unto him; but if he be devoid of this desire, the virtues he already possesses, or seems to possess, shall be taken from him,
                           not that God will deprive him of these without cause, but he will render himself unworthy of them. (St. Chrysostom)</FONT></P><B>

                           given them. --- <I>Therefore do I speak to them in parables: because seeing they see not,</I> &amp;c. This passage, by which
                           the prophet Isaias (vi. 9.) was ordered to foretell the obstinate blindness of the Jews, in refusing to receive and believe
                           in their Messias, is cited six times in the New Testament; to wit, here in St. Matthew, also Mark iv. 14[12?]; Luke viii.
                           10; John xii. 40; Acts xxviii. 26; and Romans xi. 8. In all these places we must detest the false interpretation of those
                           who, not without heresy and blasphemy, would have God to be the author and cause of sin. When it is said, (Isaias vi. 9.)
                           <I>blind the heart of this people,</I> &amp;c. the prophet is only commanded to foretell their blindness, of which, by their
                           wilful obstinacy, they were the true cause. And when we read in St. Mark, that <I>to those that are without, all things are
                           done in parables, that seeing they may see, and not see,</I> &amp;c. the word <I>that</I> does not signify the <I>cause,</I>
                           nor the <I>end,</I> but only the <I>event,</I> and the <I>consequence</I> of what would happen by the wilful blindness of
                           the Jews, and by the just <I>permission</I> of God. St. Matthew here expounds to us the words of the prophet, by which it
                           clearly appears that they were the cause of their own blindness; and that, by their obstinacy, they had made themselves unworthy
                           of particular lights from God. <I>For the heart of this people</I> (ver. 18.[15.?]) <I>is grown gross ... and their eyes they
                           have shut,</I> &amp;c. The Jews therefore shut their own eyes, hardened their own hearts, which God only permitted. See Romans
                           ix. 18. &amp;c. (Witham) --- If this blindness were natural, then indeed I would have opened their eyes to see and understand,
                           but since this blindness is voluntary, he says, <I>that seeing they see not, and hearing, they hear not;</I> i.e. they have
                           seen me cast out devils, and they said, <I>in Beelzebub he casteth out devils;</I> they heard I drew all to God, and they
                           say, <I>this man cometh not from God.</I> Since, therefore, they assert the very contrary to what they both see and hear,
                           the gift of seeing and hearing me shall be taken away from them.</FONT></P><B>

                           should be converted.</I> In this the prophet shews the atrocity of the Jewish wickedness, and the malice of their hearts,

                           more particularly the Jews in the time of Christ. (Bible de Vence) --- They were authors of their own blindness, sin, damnation,
                           and not Jesus Christ, as Calvin teaches. See also Acts&nbsp;xxviii. and Romans i. and ix. 18. &amp;c. God is not the author
