                           namely, Jonathan, the son of Samma, noted for his prudence and valour, 2 Kings xiii. 3., and xxi. 21. (Calmet) --- One might
                           die in his youth, and be therefore omitted, (Tirinus) as he had done nothing memorable. (Du Hamel) --- The Scripture does

                           --- Syriac and Arabic, "Caleb had Jerioth by his wife Azuba." We know that the latter was his wife, (ver. 19.) and this seems
                           to be the true reading. As <i>ath</i> signifies "of or from," (Noldius) the Hebrew only requires a small correction. As it
                           stands at present, it means, "Caleb begot Azuba, a woman, (or wife) and Jerioth." Protestants supply, "begat <i>children</i>

                           himself no more than Caleb did at Bethlehem, which some, without proof, pretend was called Caleb-ephrata. The Septuagint agree
