                           (Menochius) --- He seems not to have told them of the divine decree, as he might deem it irrevocable and unavoidable, so that

                           of a crime against the state, which they deprive of their labours. They unjustly abandon what God has only committed to their
                           care. Saul seems to have been afraid of receiving any insult himself, rather than to have been desirous of preventing the
                           blasphemies of the infidels against God, as the Jews pretend. He gave no signs of repentance, and the spirit of God pronounces
                           his condemnation. <I>So Saul died for his iniquities, because he transgressed;</I> (Calmet; Hebrew and Septuagint, in his
                           iniquities, by which he prevaricated. Tirinus)...<I>and moreover consulted also a witch, and trusted not in the Lord: therefore
                           he slew him,</I> 1 Paralipomenon x. 13, 14. Saul prefigured those, who having yielded to temptations, persist and die in their

                           as God set bounds to their ambition. It might otherwise have proved very fatal to his people, who were now so much divided

                           (ver. 10.; Haydock) which had been retained by the Chanaanites in the days of the judges, and which David took back, Judges

                           The like custom was observed by the Hebrew, (chap. xxi. 9,) and by the Greeks and Romans, (Calmet) to acknowledge that victory
                           was granted by God. The Philistines insulted Saul's body, and blasphemed the true God, as much as if they had taken the king

                           for Abner. (Salien) --- There was no obligation of mourning for the kings, though it is probable that those near the royal
                           city, would shew this mark of attention to the deceased monarch. See Jeremias xxxiv. 5., and 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 25. The
                           usual term of mourning was seven days, Ecclesiasticus xxii. 13. (Calmet) --- It is very difficult to ascertain the length
                           of Saul's reign. Sanctius and Tirinus allow him only 2 years; Petau 12; Calvisius 15; Salien 18; Bucholeer, and probably Josephus
                           20, though most copies of the latter have 38; St. Augustine, Serarius, Usher, &amp;c., 40, which is the term mentioned [in]
                           Acts xiii. 20. But most chronologers suppose that the time of Samuel's administration is there also included. (Haydock) ---
                           Sulpitius thinks that Saul only "reigned a very short time," as "the ark was brought to Cariathiarim before he appeared on
