                           divided into verses, was that printed at Geneva, by Conrad Badius, in the year 1557. (Haydock) --- "The book of the Generation,"
                           is not referred to the whole gospel, but to the beginning, as in Genesis v. "This is the book of the generation of Adam."
                           (Estius) --- <i>The book of the</i>[1]<i> Generation</i>, i.e. the genealogy or pedigree, which is here set down in the first
                           sixteen verses. In the style of the Scriptures any short schedule or roll is called <em>a book</em>, as the bill or short
                           writing of a divorce, is called a little book. (Matthew v. 31.) (Witham) --- Jesus, in Hebrew <i>Jesuah</i>, is the proper
                           name of Him, who was born of the Virgin Mary, who was also the Son of God, "a name given by the angel before he was conceived
                           in the womb." (Luke ii.) It signifies <i>Saviour</i>, "because he was to save his people from their sins." He was also called
                           <i>Christ</i>, which signifies anointed; for though in the Old Testament kings, priests, and prophets were <i>anointed</i>,
                           and though many were then designated by the name of <i>Jesus</i>, properly, and by an invariable custom of the New Testament,
                           that person is exclusively signified, who, on account of the union of the divine and human nature, was anointed by the Holy
                           Ghost <i>above all his fellows</i>. (Psalm xliv. and Hebrews i. 9.) Whence in this turn the hypostasis is understood, in which
                           the two natures, the divine and human, meet. (Estius)</font></font></p><b>

                           been known by tradition, the truth of which the divinely inspired evangelist here confirms. (Bible de Vence) Rahab was a debauched
                           woman, preserved in the pillage of Jericho, where she had been born. In this genealogy only four women are mentioned, of which
                           two are Gentiles, and two adulteresses. Here the greatest sinners may find grounds for confidence in the mercies of Jesus
                           Christ, and hopes of pardon, when they observed how the Lord of life and glory, to cure our pride, not only humbled himself
                           by taking upon himself the likeness of sinful flesh, but by deriving his descent from sinners, and inspiring the holy evangelist
                           to record the same to all posterity. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           size="3"> Extract from St. Chrysostom's first Homil. upon the first chapter of St. Matthew: "How, you say, does it appear
                           that Christ descended from David? For if he be born not of man, but of a virgin, concerning whose genealogy nothing is said,
                           how shall we know that he is of the family of David? We have here two difficulties to explain. Why is the genealogy of the
                           Virgin passed over in silence, and why is Joseph's mentioned, as Christ did not descend from him?...How shall we know that
                           the Virgin is descended from David? Hear the words of the Almighty addressed to the archangel Gabriel: 'Go to a virgin espoused
                           to a man, whose name is Joseph, of the house and family of David.' What could you wish plainer that this, when you hear that
                           the Virgin is of the family of David? Hence it also appears that Joseph was of the same house, for there was a law which commanded
                           them not to marry any one but of the same tribe....But whether these words, <i>of the house and family of David</i>, be applied
                           to the Virgin or to Joseph, the argument is equally strong. For if he was of the family of David, he did not take a wife but
                           out of the same tribe, from which he had descended. Perhaps you will say he transgressed this law. But the evangelist has
                           prevented such a suspicion, by testifying beforehand that Joseph was a just man. Beware how you attach crime to him, whose
                           virtue is thus publicly acknowledged....It was not the custom among the Hebrews to keep the genealogies of women. The evangelist
                           conformed to this custom, that he might not at the very beginning of the gospel offend by transgressing ancient rites, and
                           introducing novelty."</font></p><b>

                           size="3">. <i>Joram begot Ozias</i>, three generations are omitted, as we find in&nbsp;2 Paraliponenon xxii; for there, <i>Joram
                           begot Ochozias, and Ochozias begot Joas, and Joas begot Amazias, and Amazias begot Ozias</i>. This omission is not material,
                           the design of St. Matthew being only to shew the Jews that Jesus, their Messias, was of the family of David; and he is equally
                           the son, or the descendent of David, though the said three generations be left out: for Ozias may be called the son of Joram,
                           though Joram was his great-grandfather. (Witham) --- It is thought that St. Matthew omitted these three kings, Ochozias, Joas,
                           and Amazias, to preserve the distribution of his genealogy into three parts, each of fourteen generations; and, perhaps, also
                           on account of their impiety, or rather on account of the sentence pronounced against the house of Achab, from which they were
                           descended by their mother Athalia. (3 Kings xxi. 21.) (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           size="3"> <i>Josias begot</i>[2]<i> Jechonias,</i> &amp;c. The genealogy of Christ, as it appears by the 17th verse, is divided
                           by the evangelist into thrice fourteen generations, and so it is to contain 42 persons. The first class of fourteen begins
                           with Abraham, and ends with David. The second class begins with Solomon, and ends with Jechonias. The third class is supposed
                           to begin with Salathiel, and to end, says St. Jerome, with our Saviour Christ. But thus we shall only find in the third class
                           thirteen generations, and in all only forty-one, instead of forty-two. Not to mention in these short notes other interpretations,
                           the conjecture of St. Epiphanius seems to most probable, that we are to understand two Jechonias's, the father and the son,
                           who had the same name. So that the true reading should be, <i>Josias begot Jechonias</i> and <i>his brethren, and Jechonias
                           begot Jechonias, and Jechonias begot Salathiel.</i> Thus Jechonias named in the 12th verse is not the same, but the son of
                           him that was named in the 11th verse; and from Jechonias the son, begins the third class, and so Christ himself will be the
                           last or 14th person in that last series or class. There are several difficulties about reconciling this genealogy in St. Matthew
                           with that in St. Luke, chap. iii. But without insisting on all the particulars in these short notes, I hope it may suffice
                           to take notice, that no one can reasonably doubt that both the evangelists copied out the genealogical tables, as they were
                           then extant, and carefully preserved by the Jews, and especially by those families that were of the tribe of Juda, and of
                           the family of David, of which the Messias was to be born. For if the evangelists had either falsified, or made any mistake
                           as to these genealogies, the Jews undoubtedly would have objected this against their gospels, which they never did. (Witham)
                           --- The difficulties here are: 1. Why does St. Matthew give the genealogy of Joseph and not of Mary? 2. How is it inferred
                           that Jesus is descended from David and Solomon, because Joseph is the son of David? 3. How can Joseph have two men for his
                           father, Jacob of the race of Solomon, and Heli of the race of Nathan? To the 1st it is generally answered, that it was not
                           customary with the Jews to draw out the genealogies of women; to the 2nd, that Jesus being the son of Joseph, either by adoption,
                           or simply as the son of Mary his wife, he entered by that circumstance into all the rights of the family of Joseph; moreover,
                           Mary was of the same tribe and family of Joseph, and thus the heir of the branch of Solomon marrying with the heiress of the
                           branch of Nathan, the rights of the two families united in Joseph and Mary, were transmitted through them to Jesus, their
                           son and heir; to the 3rd, that Jacob was the father of Joseph according to nature, and Heli his father according to law; or
                           that Joseph was the son of the latter by adoption, and of the former by nature. (Haydock) --- <i>In the transmigration,</i>[3]
                           transportation <i>to Babylon;</i> i.e. about the time the Jews were carried away captives to Babylon. For Josias died before
                           their transportation. See 4 Kings xxiv. (Witham) --- Some think we are to read: Josias begot Joakim and his brethren; and
                           Joakim begot <i>Joachim,</i> or Jechonias. Jechonias was son to Joakim, and grandson to Josias. The brothers of Jechonias
                           are not known, but those of Joakim are known. (1 Paralipomenon iii. 15, 16.) Besides this reading give the number 14. (Haydock)
                           --- St. Jerome says that Jechonias, the son of Josias, is a different person from Jechonias who begot Salathiel, for the latter
                           was son of the former; see 1 Paralipomenon iii., where it is said that Zorobabel was son of Phadaia; but Phadaia is the same
                           as Salathiel. (Estius) --- Mat. Polus affirms that every one the least conversant in Jewish story, must know that several
                           genealogies which <em>appear</em> to contradict each other, do not in reality. (<i>Synop. Crit. </i>v. 4, p. 12.)</font></p><b>

                           size="3"> By the text of the first book of Paralipomenon iii. 17, 19., it appears that Zorobabel was grandson to Salathiel.
                           In comparing the present genealogy with that of St. Luke, (chap. iii.) we find that in this last part St. Matthew has suppressed
                           many generations, to bring the list to the number 14; for there are a greater number from Zorobabel to Jesus Christ in St.
                           Luke, but in a different branch. (Bible de Vence) --- The evangelist was well aware that the suppressed names could be easily
                           supplied from the Jewish records; and that every person could reply most satisfactorily to any objection on that head, who
                           was the least acquainted with the Jewish tables. In the first fourteen of these generations, we see the family of David rising
                           to the throne; in the second, a race of kings descending from him; in the last, the royal family descending to a poor carpenter.
                           Yet, when every human appearance of restoring the kingdom to David's house was at an end, Jesus arose to sit on his father's
                           throne, (Luke i. 32.) and of his kingdom there shall be no end. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           size="3"> <i>The husband of Mary.</i> The evangelist gives us rather the pedigree of St. <i>Joseph,</i> than that of the blessed
                           Virgin, to conform to the custom of the <i>Hebrews,</i> who in their genealogies took no notice of women: but as they near
                           akin, the pedigree of the one sheweth that of the other. (Challoner) --- <i>Joseph the husband of Mary.</i>[4] So he is again
                           called, ver. 19: but in ver. 18, we read, <i>when Mary his mother was espoused to Joseph.</i> These different expressions
                           of being <i>husband,</i> and being <i>espoused,</i> have occasioned different interpretations. Some think that Joseph and
                           the blessed Virgin were truly married at the time of Christ's conception: others, that they were only then espoused, or engaged
                           by a promise to marry afterwards. St. Jerome says, when you hear the name of husband, do not from thence imagine them to be
                           married, but remember the custom of the Scriptures, according to which, they who are espoused only, are called husbands and
                           wives. (Witham) --- That Jesus, who is called Christ, was of the seed of David, is also evident, as St. Augustine affirms
                           from various texts of the holy Scriptures, as in the epistle to the Romans, where St. Paul, (chap. i.) speaking of the Son
                           of God, says, <i>who was made to Him of the seed of David, according to the flesh</i>. See also the promises made to David,
                           2 Kings vii., Psalms lxxxviii. and cxxxi. and spoken of Solomon, as a figure of Jesus Christ. (Estius)</font></p><b>

                           size="3"> The account of the birth of Jesus Christ follows his genealogy. From these words, "before they came together," Helvidius
                           and others have started objections, which have been answered long ago by St. Jerome, where he shews in many examples from
                           Scripture, that the words <i>before</i> and <i>until</i> do not signify what happened afterwards; for that point is left indefinite,
                           but only what was done before, or not done. Thus when it is said, <i>Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine enemies
                           thy footstool,</i> Psalm cix, by no means signifies, that after the subjection of his enemies, the Son of God is no longer
                           to sit at the right hand of his Father. In common conversation, when we say that a man died before he reached his 30th year,
                           we do not mean that he afterwards attained it. Or, should we say that Helvidius died before he did penance, we cannot mean
                           that he afterwards did penance: the same conclusion should be deduced from the words, "before they came together," the end
                           being accomplished by the power of the operation of the Holy Ghost, without their going together. If we should advance, that
                           such a man was cured before he went to a physician, the natural inference would be, that he did not go to a physician at all.
                           Thus also in the language of Scripture, the word <i>first-begotten</i> does not mean after whom others were born, but before
                           whom no one was born, whether there were further issue or not.&nbsp; And the reason is, because the law required that a sacrifice
                           should be offered for the first-born, and that he should be redeemed very soon after his birth; nor did it allow the parents
                           to wait and see if any other son should be born. (Estius) --- True and perfect marriage, and continual living in the same,
                           without knowing each other. (St. Augustine, lib. ii. Consen. Evang. chap. i.) (Bristow)</font></p><b>

                           and not willing to expose her, by denouncing her, or giving her a bill of divorce, he had a mind to dismiss her privately,
                           committing the whole cause to God. Let us learn from Joseph to be ever tender of our neighbour's reputation, and never to
                           entertain any injurious thoughts, or any suspicions to his prejudice. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           her. (Witham) --- As the incarnation of the Son of God was effected by the whole blessed Trinity, it may be asked why this
                           operation is peculiarly attributed to the Holy Ghost, not only here, but in Luke ii. and in the apostles' creed? The answer
                           is, because as power is attributed to the Father, wisdom to the Son, so goodness is attributed to the Holy Ghost, and the
                           gifts of grace which proceed from it. (Estius in diff. loca.)</font></p><b>

                           he was distinguished, as well as by the adorable name of Jesus. The expectations of both Jew and Gentile looked forward to
                           a saviour. St. Augustine, in the 18th book, 23rd chapter, de Civitate Dei, introduces a curious anecdote. He mentions there,
                           that he received from the eloquent and learned Proconsul Flactianus, a book containing in Greek the verses of one of the Sybils,
                           which related to the coming of Christ. The substance of them is much the same as occurs in the prophecies of Isaiah, from
                           which Virgil has likewise copied into his Pollio, many of the sublime thoughts which we find in that beautiful eclogue. It
                           is remarkable that of the initials of these verses, St. Augustine had formed an acrostic to the following import, <i><u>Iesous
                           Christos Deos uios soter</u>;</i> that is, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, <i>Saviour.</i> (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           that the Hebrew word <i>alma,</i> in the prophet Isaias, signified no more than a <i>young woman</i>. But St. Jerome tells
                           us that <i>alma</i> signifies a <i>virgin kept close up.</i> Let the Jews, says he, shew me any place in which the Hebrew
                           word <i>alma,</i> is applied to any one that is not a virgin, and I will own my ignorance. Besides the very circumstances
                           in the text of the prophet, are more than a sufficient confutation of this Jewish exposition; for there a <i>sign,</i> or
                           miracle, is promised to Achaz; and what miracle would it be for a young woman to have a child, when she had ceased to be a
                           virgin? (Witham) --- How happens it that nowhere in the gospels, or in any other part, do we find Christ called <i>Emmanuel?</i>
                           I answer, that in the Greek expression the name is given for the thing signified; and the meaning is: He shall be a true Emmanuel,
                           i.e., a God with us, true God and true man. (Estius) --- The text says, <i>they shall call,</i> i.e., all men shall look upon
                           Him as an Emmanuel. Again, <i>his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty, the Prince of peace,</i> &amp;c.,
                           i.e., He shall be all these, not so much nominally, as really and in effect. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           were called brothers and sisters. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           size="3"> See note on ver. 18. --- St. Jerome assures us, that St. Joseph always preserved his virginal chastity. It is "<em>of
                           faith</em>" that nothing contrary thereto ever took place with his chaste spouse, the blessed Virgin Mary. St. Joseph was
                           given her by heaven to be the protector of her chastity, to secure her from calumnies in the birth of the Son of God, to assist
                           her in her flight into Egypt, &amp;c. &amp;c. We cannot sufficiently admire the modest reserve of both parties. Mary does
                           not venture to explain to her troubled husband the mystery of her pregnancy; and Joseph is afraid of mentioning his uneasiness
                           and doubts, for fear of troubling her delicate mind and wounding her exquisite feelings. So great modesty, reserve and silence,
                           are sure to be approved by heaven; and God sends an angel to Joseph in his sleep, to dissipate his doubts, and to expound
                           to him the mystery of the incarnation. (Haydock)</font></p><b>
