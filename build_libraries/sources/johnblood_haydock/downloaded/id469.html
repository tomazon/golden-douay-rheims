                           Septuagint, "to the west of Moab." These plains had formerly belonged to that people, but the Hebrews had lately taken them
                           from Sehon, and intended now to pass over the Jordan. The Moabites, however, being jealous of their growing power, called
                           in the aid of the Madianites, and of the magician Balaam, and, by their wanton provocation, brought destruction upon themselves.
                           We know not exactly the extent of the dominions of the Moabites. They seemed to have lost the greatest part of the country
                           north of the Arnon. Their last town and capital was Ar, chap. xxi. 13. Yet they still kept possession of Mount Phasga. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           St. Peter (ii. 11, 15) reads Bosor. --- <I>A soothsayer,</I> or magician, (<I>ariolum</I>) as this word always indicates,
                           Josue xiii. 22. The Hebrews believe he was once a true prophet, a descendant of Buz, the son of Melcha, and the same as Eliu,
                           the friend of Job. (St. Jerome, q. 3. Hebrew in Genesis) He certainly foretold the Messias, or star of Jacob, by divine inspiration,
                           chap. xxiv. 17. (Haydock) --- He consults and acknowledges the true God, ver. 8, 18, 20. Origen (hom. 13,) believes that he
                           left a book of his prophecies, which was known to the wise men, and discovered to them the birth of the Messias; and some
                           Rabbins think that Moses has here inserted from that work what relates to Balaam. St. Augustine (q. 48,) shews that he was
                           a wicked man, of whom nevertheless God made use to convey important instructions; and that he is one of those reprobates who
                           will say, <I>Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name?</I> He is placed with Cain and Core, St. Jude 11. St. Ambrose (ep.
                           50,) observes, that he might prophesy, like Caiphas, without knowing what he said, and that the gift of prophecy on this occasion,
                           was no proof of his virtue. Many of the Fathers look upon him as a mere magician, who could utter no blessing, but only curses,
                           by the rules of his infernal art. He did not design to consult God, but the Lord puts answers into his mouth. (Theodoret,
                           q. 39, 42.) The method of consultation seemed to border on superstition. He wished to make God change his resolutions, as
                           if he were an idol, and attempted to evade the impressions of his spirit. (Calmet) --- <I>The river,</I> Euphrates, which
                           waters the country of the Ammonites. (Menochius) --- Hebrew, "to Pethora, which is by the land of the children of his people."
                           St. Jerome has translated Pethora "soothsayer," and has left <I>Ammon</I> undeclined. (Haydock) --- The Chaldean informs us,
                           that he was a resident at Petor, a city of Syria, on the Euphrates. It is probably the same town with the Pacora of Ptolemy,
                           near Thapsacus. Balaam is styled an Aramean; (chap. xxiii. 17,) and we know that he came from Mesopotamia. Hebrew <I>Aram
                           Naharaim,</I> (Deuteronomy xxiii. 4.; Calmet) or "Syria, between the two rivers," the Euphrates and Tigris. (Salien) --- <I>Me,</I>
                           ready to fall upon my dominions. It appears hence, that Balaam was in high estimation, since a distant king depends more upon
                           his power, than upon the efforts of all his own armies, and those of his auxiliaries, and is willing to pay him for cursing
                           his enemies at so dear a rate. Perhaps he thought that they employed magical arts to conquer their enemies, by prayer. See
                           Exodus xvii. 11.; Origen, hom. 13. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           The ancients placed great confidence in those whom they believed to be under the guidance of a superior spirit, whether good
                           or bad. They thought their blessing or cursing would surely have its effect. By means of charms, they also strove to evoke
                           or draw off the tutelary god of a place, before they could expect to take possession of it. Hence, as it was requisite to
                           mention the true name of the place, fictitious names were given to most cities of importance, while the real appellation was
                           kept a profound secret; and Valerius Soranus was severely punished for discovering the name of Rome, Valentia. See Pliny,
                           [Natural History?] iii. 5.; Solin. ii.; Plut.[Plutarch?] prob. vi. (Calmet) --- <I>Rome,</I> in Greek, has the same import
                           as <I>Valentia</I> in Latin, and signifies <I>strength.</I> (Haydock) --- Macrobius has preserved the form of a solemn curse,
                           pronounced by the Roman general against the Carthaginians, Saturn iii. 9.: "Dis Pater, or Jupiter, or if you prefer any other
                           title, I beg that you will send fright and terror, and put this city of Carthage, and this army which I intend to specify,
                           to flight, &amp;c. If you will perform these things, according to my intention, I promise to offer in sacrifice to you, O
                           earth, mother of all things, and to you, great god Jupiter, three black sheep." Thus, probably, Balac wished the Hebrews to
                           be devoted or cursed. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           beast, the brutal fury and folly of Balaam. (Challoner) --- St. Thomas Aquinas (ii. 2. q. 105) says, an angel spoke by the
                           mouth of the ass, in like manner as the devil did by that of the serpent, Genesis iii. Infidels deride this miracle, and some
                           have thought that it was only in the imagination of Balaam, that this dialogue was formed. (Maimonides) --- St. Gregory of
                           Nyssa, seems to think that the ass only brayed as usual, and that the soothsayer, being accustomed to augur from the voice
                           of animals, understood its meaning. But St. Peter says, <I>the dumb beast....speaking with man's voice, forbade the folly
                           of the prophet,</I> 2 Peter ii. 16. God did not endue it with understanding on this occasion, but only formed, by its mouth,
                           such sounds as might serve to repress the cruel folly of Balaam. But he was more stupid than the ass. "Being accustomed, it
                           seems, to such prodigies," (<I>monstris</I>) and intent upon lucre, he paid no farther regard to such a wonderful transaction,
                           but held conversation with his ass, without any emotion. (St. Augustine, q. 48, 50.) (Calmet) --- The pagan historians relate
                           many instances of beasts and trees speaking; (Grotius) so that they object to this history, and to that of the serpent, with
                           a very bad grace, as St. Cyril remarks, in his third book against Julian. (Haydock) --- They relate that the ass of Bacchus
                           spoke to him, and the horse and elephant of Achilles and Porus addressed their respective masters, while the oaks of Dodona
                           were famous for their oracles. (Calmet) --- The river Causus said, "Hail, Pythagoras." (Porphyrius, cited by St. Cyril, &amp;c.)

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 Balaam said: I have sinned, not knowing that thou didst stand against

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 The angel said: Go with these men, and see thou speak no other thing

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 He answered him: Lo, here I am: shall I have power to speak any other
