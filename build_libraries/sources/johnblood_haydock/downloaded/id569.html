                           "bless the Lord, for that leaders have risen up in Israel, and the people have shewn their good will." These two things were
                           to be greatly desired, as a general can do but little without an obedient army, and the latter is, in a manner, useless, without
                           a head. Both had been wanting in Israel for some time, and even still, some of the tribes seem to be blamed for not co-operating
                           with zeal, ver. 15, &amp;c. This verse is repeated as a kind of chorus, ver. 9. The zeal and concord of the little troop,
                           which had met the formidable army of Sisara, deserved the highest applause. (Haydock) --- Men bless God when they give him
                           thanks; superiors bless by imparting some spiritual benefit. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           the late victory, with those which God wrought when he led his victorious bands through the desert, and conquered the countries
                           of Sehon, &amp;c. (Haydock) --- He provided for the wants of his people, even in the most desolate regions, giving them water

                           Hebrew is rather different, "They chose new gods:" some copies of the Septuagint have "vain gods, (Calmet) as barley bread."
                           Others agree with the Hebrew, "Then war was in the gates." Jabin would not allow any arms in the country, and hence Samgar
                           was forced to use the implements of husbandry. So the Philistines afterwards would not suffer the Hebrews to have a smith
                           among them, lest they should make arms, 1 Kings xiii. 19, 22.</FONT></P><B>

                           and of Benjamin, which lies after, that is, beyond Ephraim; and so on to the very confines of Amalec. Or, it alludes to former
                           victories of the people of God, particularly that which was freshest in memory, when the men of Ephraim and Benjamin, with
                           Aod at their head, overthrew their enemies, the Moabites, with the Amalecites their allies. See chap. iii. (Challoner) ---
                           <I>Fight.</I> Debbora insinuates that the late victory had rendered Nephthali and Issachar as famous as these tribes, which
                           had formerly sent forth the greatest generals; Josue, who conquered Amalec, (Exodus xvii. 10,) and Aod, of the tribe of Benjamin,
                           (Calmet) who had so greatly signalized himself, and sounded the alarm in Mount Ephraim with success, chap. iii. 13, 27. (Haydock)
                           --- Hebrew, "out of Ephraim he has torn them (Protestants, <I>was there</I> a root of them against, or) into Amalec, and after
                           thee Benjamin among thy people." There was a mountain called <I>Amalec,</I> in the tribe of Ephraim, (chap. xii. 15,) where
                           some victory may have been obtained, though we know not the particulars of it. (Calmet) --- They and the neighbouring tribes
                           might have encountered Amalec, coming to assist Jabin. (Du Hamel) --- It is hardly probable that the army of Sisara would
                           flee in that direction, as they would have had to encounter all the multitudes of Israel, and could have no prospect of saving
                           themselves. Benjamin, who was farther off Debbora than Ephraim, is praised for expelling the king of Moab out of their city
                           of Engaddi; (Haydock) or else the victories which this tribe obtained over the joint forces of the <I>people</I> of Israel
                           are meant, (Calmet) as they shewed the valour of this tribe, though in so bad a cause. (Haydock) --- It is thought that the
                           Moabites fell upon their territory only after most of the inhabitants were cut off, chap. xix., and xx. The Septuagint and
                           Theodotion take no notice of Amalec, as they have read, <I>Amok,</I> a valley: "the people of Ephraim chastised them in the
                           valley, and thy brother Benjamin, in his people." The Chaldean understands the whole verse, of the wars against Amalec, who
                           had been routed by Josue, and would fall a prey to the arms of Saul, who was of the tribe of Benjamin. Many commentators follow
                           this explanation. It does not appear that Barac received any aid from these tribes, nor from <I>Machir,</I> or any of those
                           who lived at a distance. (Calmet) --- As for <I>Zabulon,</I> the Vulgate intimates that great generals were found among them
                           but the Hebrew rather gives them the praise of learning: "They that handle the pen of the writer." (Haydock) --- Yet <I>sopher</I>
                           is applied not only to writers, and to those who are learned in the law, as the <I>scribes,</I> Esdras, Baruch, &amp;c., were,
                           but also to commissaries, secretaries of state, and officers who were employed both in peace and war, 2 Paralipomenon xxvi.
                           11. Hence the Septuagint translate, "out of Zabulon, the powerful in the sceptre of learning;" (Calmet) (Grabe,) "of instruction."
                           (Haydock) --- Some, without any proof, attribute the institution of these officers to Moses, others to David. We read of many
                           who possessed this title under his reign; and ever after, the kings of Juda had scribes, as some great men had also. The kings
                           of Persia kept secretaries to write their edicts, and some they sent, with greater authority, into the provinces. See 1 Esdras
                           iv. 8. Ecclesiasticus (x. 5,) says, <I>upon the person of the scribe God shall lay his honour.</I> The scribes, or sopherim,
                           seem therefore to have enjoyed an extensive authority, and the tribe of <I>Zabulon</I> used it on this occasion for the common
                           good, (ver. 18.; Calmet) while many of the other tribes seem to be accused of backwardness in the cause of God.</FONT></P><B>

                           their flocks. (Challoner) --- Hebrew may have different explanations, "In the divisions (families) of Ruben, there are princes
                           of a great heart," renowned for their prudence and valour: or "Ruben dwelt in his division, (or territory) there are chiefs,"
                           &amp;c. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "for the divisions of Ruben, <I>there were</I> great thoughts of heart." Bonfrere supposes

                           protection was obtained by the prayers of the thundering legion, in the army of M. Aurelius; (Tertullian; Eusebius, Hist.

                           spiritual enemies. (Challoner) --- Eusebius seems to have thought that Merom, a body of water, and the village of Meroz (Haydock)
                           were the same place, 12 miles from Sebaste. The inhabitants were surely under an obligation of assisting their brethren; and
                           these, it appears, lived in the vicinity, and neglected their duty. Septuagint Alexandrian reads Mazor. Some stars are styled

                           This is not expressed in Hebrew, "his wise ladies answered her," or joined in her lamentations. Then the mother comforted
                           herself with the hope that they might possibly be employed in dividing the spoils. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "yea she answered

                           divers colours," &amp;c. (Haydock) --- Perhaps instead of damsel, literally, "a belly or two," which occurs no where else,

                           Usher says only 20 from the victory of Barac. Potau and other able chronologers allow the full term of 40 years, after that
                           event. See chap. iii. 11. (Haydock) --- Barac was buried at Cedes, where Benjamin (Itin.) saw his tomb. (Calmet) --- Ozi,
                           the high priest for the last 40 years, was succeeded by Zaraias, in the year of the world 2760, who reigned an equal length
                           of time, and died with Gedeon. Maraioth took his place, in the year 2801, at the commencement of Abimelech's usurpation, and
                           died in the year 2841. (Salien)</FONT></P><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>
