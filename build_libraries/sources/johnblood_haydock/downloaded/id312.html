                           <p><strong>Notes &amp; Commentary:</strong></p>
                           <p><b>Ver. 1.</b> <i>Statue.</i> It was not the figure of a man, (Calmet) the dimensions 90 feet high and 9 broad (Worthington)
                           being disproportionate; though a man might be represented on the pillar. Some take it for Nabolpolassar, (Calmet) or for the
                           king himself. (St. Jerome) (Worthington) --- But he never complains of the injury shewn to his own person, and therefore it
                           probably was meant for Bel, the chief god, chap. iv. 5., and xiv. 1. This nation adored statues, Baruch vi. 3. The Persians
                           worshipped only the elements. (Calmet) --- Ochus first set up the statue of the goddess Tanais or Anais. (Clem. Protr.) ---
                           <i>Dura.</i> Septuagint, "enclosed." (St. Jerome) --- This happened towards the end of the king's reign, (ver. 98, &amp;c.)
                           of course the three young men might be about fifty years old. (Calmet)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 2.</b> <i>Nobles.</i> Literally, "satraps," or, "the king's domestics." (Septuagint in 1 Esdras viii. 36.)
                           --- <i>Judges,</i> or "governors of provinces." (ibid.; Theodot. &amp;c.) --- <i>Captains</i> of the soothsayers. --- <i>Rulers;</i>
                           "tyrants," here denoting treasurers. (Calmet) --- <i>Governors.</i> Literally, "the grandees who were in power;" (Haydock)
                           counsellors. The original adds, (Calmet) <i>Thopthia,</i> (Haydock) "lawyers" and orators. The head of the Turkish religion
                           is called <i>muphti,</i> from the same root, (Calmet) <i>peti,</i> "to teach." (Haydock)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 5.</b> <i>Symphony.</i> This and several other terms seem taken from the Greek, though the <i>scythara</i>
                           and <i>sambuca</i> came originally from Chaldea. (Calmet) --- <i>Down.</i> This and offering incense were sometimes considered
                           as marks of idolatry; so being present at the sermons and churches of Protestants was a sign of joining in their communion,
                           being required for that purpose. (Worthington)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 8.</b> <i>Jews:</i> the three children whom they viewed with a jealous eye. Daniel was too much exalted, or
                           was absent with other Jews.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 15.</b> <i>Hand?</i> Proof of this king's inconstancy, as he had witnessed the power of God!</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 18.</b> <i>He.</i> Chaldean, "not" (Calmet) --- By this modest yet resolute answer, they testified their faith
                           in God's power, and their determination rather to suffer death (Worthington) than to go against their conscience. (Haydock)
                           --- They were ignorant whether God would preserve them from the flames or not, (Worthington) as he is said to have rescued
                           Abraham from a similar danger, 2 Esdras ix. 7.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 20.</b> <i>Strongest.</i> Chaldean, "mighty in strength;" (Haydock) his own guards, the usual executioners.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 21.</b> <i>Coats,</i> or various coloured bandages for the thighs, used by men and women. Aquila and Th. retain
                           the original term, <i><u>Sarabarois</u>.</i> Chaldean, saraballa. (Calmet) --- <i>Caps:</i> "tiaras." (Haydock) --- The king
                           alone wore them upright.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 22.</b> <i>Slew.</i> They were working still at the furnace, when it burst out and destroyed them, (Calmet)
                           while the three Jews were praising God below. (Haydock) (ver. 46, 48.)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 24.</b> <i>And,</i> &amp;c. "What follows I have not found in the Hebrew volumes." (St. Jerome) (Haydock) ---
                           Here St. Jerome takes notice, that from this verse to ver. 91 was not in the Hebrew in his time. But as it was in all the
                           Greek Bibles, (which were originally translated from the Hebrew) it is more than probable that it had been formerly in the
                           Hebrew; or rather in the Chaldaic, in which the Book of Daniel was written. But this is certain: that it is and has been of
                           old, received by the Church, and read as canonical Scripture in her liturgy and divine offices. (Challoner) --- See the preface.
                           (Worthington)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 27.</b> <i>True;</i> not fickle, and liable to change. (Calmet) --- <i>Opera mutas non mutas consilium.</i>
                           (St. Augustine, Conf. i. 4.) --- Cappel. argues from this confession, that the piece is not divine, as they would rather have
                           burst out into expressions of admiration, as they do in the canticle below. But they had done so already, (ver. 26) and make
                           this confession, (Haydock) as Daniel does, chap. ix.; reflecting, that if the nation had not transgressed, they would not
                           thus have been exposed to the fury of the king. (Houbigant. v. 40.) (Haydock)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 33.</b> <i>Thee.</i> Pagans take occasion to vilify our religion.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 34.</b> <i>Sake.</i> This disinterested motive is often urged, Joshua vii. 9., and 2 Machabees viii. 15. (Calmet)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 35.</b> <i>One.</i> Moses used the like terms, and pacified God, Exodus xxxii. (Worthington)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 38.</b> <i>Thee,</i> in Jerusalem, (Haydock) or Judea. There were chiefs and judges, (Chap. xiii.) as well
                           as prophets, (Ezechiel, &amp;c.) among the captives. Yet the republic was in disorder. (Calmet) --- Sedecias was dead, Joakim
                           in prison, so that no Jewish king ruled over the people; nor was there any prophet in the promised land, Jeremias being either
                           dead or in Egypt. (Worthington) --- Prophets were at least very rare. (Menochius)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 40.</b> <i>Sacrifice</i> of ourselves. (Haydock) --- They knew not yet whether they would escape. When they
                           beheld the angel they had greater confidence, and broke forth into a hymn of praise. (Houbigant.) --- They now offer all they
                           can, a humble heart!</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 43.</b> <i>Name,</i> by rescuing us, that all may confess thy power. (Calmet)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 46.</b> <i>Brimstone.</i> Literally, naphtha, (Haydock) or bitumen, which was very inflammable. --- <i>Tow,</i>
                           besmeared with pitch. (Calmet) --- <i>Dry</i> <i>(malleolis) </i>"bundles" of sticks, or ropes, covered with pitch. (Haydock)
                           --- <i>Manipuli spart&#339;i pice contecti.</i> (Nonius.)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 48.</b> <i>Furnace.</i> These might be other victims, (Haydock) or he recapitulates what had been said ver.
                           22, (Calmet) which is by no means unusual, though Cappel. would hence reject the piece. (Houbigant.)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 49.</b> <i>Furnace:</i> so that it destroyed the Chaldeans, while it had no power to hurt God's servants. The
                           operation of the laws nature was thus only restrained. (Haydock)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 53.</b> <i>Temple;</i> heaven, styled the throne, ver. 54. The temple was now in ruins.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 55.</b> <i>Depths,</i> from whom nothing is hidden. --- <i>Cherubims,</i> as on thy chariot.</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 65.</b> <i>Spirits:</i> winds. Angels and men are mentioned elsewhere. (Calmet) --- They rejoice that the angels
                           always praise God, and wish that all would strive to imitate them. (Worthington)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 67.</b> <i>Heat.</i> Winter and summer. Some copies have, <i>æstas.</i> (Calmet)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 72.</b> <i>Darkness.</i> The privation of light has its use, and invites men to praise. (St. Augustine, de
                           Nat. Boni. 16.) (Worthington)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 86.</b> <i>Souls,</i> in a separate state. Angels are invited before. (Calmet)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 88.</b> <i>Ananias,</i> &amp;c. They retain their Hebrew names, despising those imposed by the Chaldeans, with
                           their impious manners, chap. i. 7. The inanimate creation is invited to praise God in its way, (Psalm cxlviii.) as well as
                           those endued with reason. The former never refuse obedience. (Haydock) --- <i>Hell:</i> the grave. (Calmet)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 90.</b> <i>And ever.</i> "Hitherto does not occur in Hebrew; and what we have written, is translated from the
                           edition of Theodotion." (St. Jerome, ver. 24.)</p><b>
                           </b><p><b>Ver. 91.</b> <i>Then</i> hearing these praises, and seeing people walking in the fire. Grabe's edition after ver.
