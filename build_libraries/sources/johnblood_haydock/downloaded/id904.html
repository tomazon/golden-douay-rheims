                           was already king. (Menochius) --- Josephus passes over this history. It is not known for what reason, (Calmet) unless he was
                           staggered at the petition of Naaman, ver. 18, 19. (Haydock) --- <i>Syria.</i> The Rabbins say, by killing Achab, 3 Kings xxii.
                           34. But their authority is very small; (Haydock) and he might signalize himself on many other occasions. --- <i>Leper.</i>
                           This malady did not exclude him from court. The Hebrews allowed such to appear in public, till the priests had declared them

                           of this nature were then very common, (see Judges xi. 3., and Job i. 15.) and regarded as noble military exploits. When the
                           Greeks first became acquainted with navigation, they exercised themselves in this manner; (Thucydides l.) and the Germans
                           allowed their citizens to take from other people. <i>Juventutis exercendæ ac desidiæ minuendæ causa.</i> (Cæsar, Bel. Gal.
                           vi.) Those who had been plundered, were allowed to redeem their goods. (Strabo xi.) --- The Arabs still maintain their right
                           to live upon their neighbours. (Calmet) --- The Christian religion has introduced more gentle manners. --- <i>Maid.</i> It

                           gardens. Maundrell could discover no vestiges of these names in Syria, but he describes the Barrady, which supplies Damascus
                           with abundance of water. Stephanus calls it <i>Bardine;</i> and others, the Chrysorroas. The Orontes, which is supposed to

                           observations of their servants, as Naaman did repeatedly, ver. 2. This may serve to correct their pride. (Haydock) --- <i>Clean.</i>

                           was cured in an instant. To bathe in a rapid stream, is allowed to be very salutary for removing the diseases of the skin.
                           (Calmet) (Vales. 38.) --- The fathers discover in this miracle, a figure of the Gentiles called to the faith by the Synagogue,

                           generally received such presents. But Eliseus acts with more reserve in regard of this stranger, as St. Paul did towards the
                           new converts; though he received some sustenance from those, who would be less in danger of suspecting that he was actuated
                           by selfish views in preaching the gospel, 2 Corinthians x. 7., and xii. 14., and Matthew x. 8. (Calmet) --- They abstained
                           from every appearance of evil, (Haydock) though they might lawfully have accepted such presents. Eliseus wished to convince
                           Naaman that God's grace was not to be purchased, and to leave a lesson of moderation to future teachers. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           altar, or to inclose within a box of brass, as was done in the altar of holocausts in the desert; or, in fine, to sprinkle
                           on some clean place, where an altar might be erected, in honour of the true God. He does not inquire what ceremonies were
                           used in the land of Israel, (Calmet) as he was not enrolled by circumcision, among the Hebrews, as an observer of their law;
                           but intended to serve God, like Job, and many other righteous Gentiles, who kept themselves clear of idolatry, and observed
                           the ancient patriarchal religion with a clean heart. (Haydock) --- As God had sanctified the land by the observance of his
                           true religion, Naaman rightly judged that it was fitter for an altar than the earth of his own country. (Worthington) ---
                           The Jews had a particular veneration for it, Psalm ci. 15. They built a synagogue in Persia, with earth and stones taken from
                           Jerusalem. (Benjamin) --- Christians sometimes carry away the same earth. (St. Augustine, de C.[City of God?] xxii. 8.) (Turon.
                           i. 7.) --- The Donatists had a sovereign respect for it; (St. Augustine, ep. 52.) and it is said that St. Helena brought a
                           great quantity to the church of the Holy Cross of Jerusalem, at Rome. (Mabillon, Itin. p. 187.) (Calmet) --- <i>Lord.</i>
                           Out of Palestine, the Gentiles were not prohibited to offer sacrifice to the true God any where; nor were they under any obligation

                           himself a worshipper of the only true and living God) but it was no more than doing a civil office to the king, his master,
                           whose leaning upon him obliged him to bow at the same time that he bowed. (Challoner) --- Some assert that the prophet does
                           not even authorize this civil assistance in the temple of idols, but simply tells Naaman to go in peace, and to think no more
                           of his former religion; that he will beseech the Lord not to suffer him to be exposed to the danger. (Junius and Piscator)
                           (Calmet) --- Some formerly pleaded this example, to excuse their occasional conformity in going to the Protestant churches,
                           as the law required. But the case was very different. Greater perfection is required in the new law. They had not to act in
                           the capacity of Naaman; and their attendance was considered as a profession of a false religion. Their directors loudly condemned
                           the practice. They ought rather to have imitated Eleazar, &amp;c., who refused to eat swine's flesh, 2 Machabees vi., and
                           vii. (Worthington) --- Though the king intended to adore the idol, Naaman referred his worship to God alone. (Bristow, Mot.
                           23.; Theodoret, q. 19.; and a Greek interpreter.) --- The Hebrew term signifies, either to adore mentally, or to bend down;
                           which latter is the sense applicable to Naaman. (Cajetan) (Amama) --- His "request must certainly refer to the time past,
                           and not to that to come; as if he begged an indulgence in idolatry, or of countenancing his master's idol-worship, by his
                           presence." (Button, Dict.) --- The Jews foolishly pretend (Calmet) that "the proselyte of dwelling," like Naaman, might return
                           to the service of idols, in his own country, without its being imputed to him. (Selden, Jur. ii. 11.) (Maimonides) --- The
                           conduct of the Syrian convert, whether past or future, undoubtedly filled him with alarm. If he considered the danger of a
                           merely civil attendance upon the king, in an idolatrous temple, we cannot condemn him of idle scrupulosity; (Haycock) since
                           many have found a difficulty in admitting the lawfulness of such a practice, and have even blamed both Naaman and the prophet.
                           (Greg. de Valentia, &amp;c., ep. Cornelius a Lapide) (Calmet) --- But if the practice was irreprehensible, as most interpreters
                           assert, the answer of Eliseus might give this assurance to Naaman, and inform him that he need be under no farther apprehension
                           on that account. <i>Go in peace.</i> These words do not expressly solve the difficulty; but the mode in which they were uttered
                           might intimate, either that the general would be no longer under that embarrassment, (as we do not read that he ever attended
                           the king of Syria into the temple afterwards) or that God had forgiven his former offences, and particularly the scandalous
                           idolatry which now gave him so much pain. The original, ver. 18, which is generally translated in the present or future, (Haydock)
                           may be better rendered in the past tense, as the Chaldean has it. "In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant. My master going
                           into the temple of Remmon to worship there, and leaning upon my hand, and I worshipped in the temple of Remmon, when <i>I</i>
                           did worship in the temple of Remmon, that the Lord pardon," &amp;c. St. Jerome and the Septuagint seem to have read more correctly,
                           <i>when he,</i> &amp;c. We may also render it in the present tense, "and I worship," or, "am wont to adore;" not that he meant
                           to prevaricate any longer. The Syriac and Arabic read with an interrogation. "When I shall adore....(Calmet; or bow down,
                           Haydock) will the Lord pardon me?" But this rather increases the difficulty. (Calmet) --- We may therefore conclude either
                           that Naaman had no decision, or that he had leave to serve his master, (Haydock) in a civil capacity even in the temple; (Menochius;
                           Tirinus; Alex. 2. dis. 7.; Santius, &amp;c.) or, that he obtained pardon for his past transgressions. (Bochart; Calmet, &amp;c.)
                           --- <i>Earth,</i> as the expression is rendered [in] Genesis xxxv. 16., thoug here it is literally, "at the chosen season;"
                           <i>electo,</i> not <i>verno.</i> The sense is the same. <i>Cibrath,</i> untranslated by the Septuagint, may denote a certain
                           space, or village; (Haydock) "a furrow," of 240 feet long, and half that breadth; (Calmet) "a mile;" (Chaldean; Pagnin) or
                           a portion of time allowed by the law, about a quarter of an hour, during which a mile, or sabbath-day's journey, might be
                           performed. (Tirinus) --- Protestants, "a little way."</font></p><b>
