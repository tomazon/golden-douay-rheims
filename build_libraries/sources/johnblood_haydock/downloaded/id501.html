                           for want of shoes, chap. xxix. 5. (Chaldean) This miracle of the Hebrews, being so well provided with raiment in a desert
                           country, is mentioned, 2 Esdras ix. 21. Cosmas (B. v.) allows only that merchants constantly supplied them, and Abenezra thinks
                           that they had brought plenty for change out of Egypt. (Calmet) --- But the Scripture seems to acknowledge something more wonderful;
                           namely, the good condition of the people's feet, and of their garments, after they had been worn for such a length of time.
                           As their numbers had not increased, the children might be supplied with the clothes of the deceased; so that there is no need
                           of making the miracle still greater, by asserting, as some have done, that the garments grew larger with the bodies of those
