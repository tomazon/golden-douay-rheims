                           into the promised land. (Menochius) --- The custom of imposing hands on a person, is of high antiquity, and is still practised
                           in the Christian church in the ordination of her ministers. (Numbers viii. 10; Acts vi. 6.) See Matthew xix. 13; Numbers xxvii.

                           observable in Scripture; being intended to shew that the Church, though chosen later out of all nations, should obtain the

                           (Haydock) --- St. Basil (contra Eunom. iii.) and St. Chrysostom, with many others, allege this text, to prove that an angel
                           is given to man for the direction of his life, and to protect him against the assaults of the rebel angels, as Calvin himself

                                    it to the head of Manasses.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And he said to his father: It should not be so, my father; for this
