                           It was upon this occasion that the feast of expiation (<I>kippurim</I>) was instituted, to enforce the reverence due to holy
                           things, and particularly to the tabernacle. Hebrew adds, "before the Lord," (Haydock) and does not specify <I>strange fire;</I>

                           When the tabernacle was to be removed, and when he had to consult the Lord, he might also enter, arrayed in his pontifical
                           attire. If the high priest was prevented by any legal uncleanness, the next priest was substituted to perform his office.

                           On this day the high priest appeared in linen clothes, like one of the inferior priests, without the jewels; though Josephus
                           (Jewish Wars v. 15,) asserts the contrary. (Calmet) --- This was a feast of sorrow and of penance. (Tirinus) --- Perhaps he
                           put on his more costly attire before he entered the holy of holies, ver. 23, 24. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           during the year. If their sins were voluntary, they were obliged also to have perfect charity and contrition. The ram was
                           offered for the sins of the people. Moses speaks of the red heifer, (Numbers xix.) which was also offered, out of the camp,
                           for the people. This solemn day was to be kept by all as a rigid "fast from meat, drink, washing, anointing, wearing shoes,
                           or using marriage." This is the idea which the Oriental nations generally have of a fast. They commence at midnight, and end
                           with the following sun-set; after which they eat what they think proper. (Calmet) --- On the day of expiation, the Jews made
                           a tenfold confession of their sins. (Morinus, p&#339;nit. ii. 22.)</FONT></P><B>

                           with us the incense of prayer, and the blood, that is, the passion of Christ. Where also note, that the high priest, before
                           he went into the holy of holies, was to wash his whole body; and then to put on white linen garments; to signify the purity
                           and chastity with which we are to approach to God. (Challoner) --- The Septuagint call this goat <I>apopompaion,</I> "the

                           God deigned to have his tabernacle in the midst of the camp, where so many sins, and marks of disrespect, as well as legal
                           uncleannesses, were found. (Haydock) --- Sin so defileth the soul, that the most holy place is contaminated thereby. (Theodoret,

                           Even the other priests were excluded from the tabernacle. The high priest placed incense on the censer as soon as he entered
                           within the veil, and prayed for all blessings, in few words, that the people might not be uneasy, fearing lest something had
                           befallen him. This was the form: "Be pleased to grant, O Lord our God, that this year may be warm and rainy, that the sovereign
                           power may abide in the house of Juda, that thy people may not be deprived of any of the necessaries of life; and hear not
                           the petitions of travellers," (which are commonly vain and selfish) of "of sinners," as others translate. (Calmet) --- Those
                           who were forbidden to be present on this occasion, might have made the same objections as Protestants do against the law of
                           the Church, which prescribes a language not commonly understood by all, in the administration of her sacraments. Have either
                           any reason to be offended? (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Beginning on the evening of the ninth Tisri, which corresponds with part of our September and October, and is the first month

                           of seven years old begin to join in this mortification. Boys of 13, and girls of 11 years old complete, were obliged to fast.
                           See ver. 6. The Samaritans pray all the day, and give no food even to infants during the 24 hours. (Calmet) --- Moses was
                           the first who shewed them the example; and this was the only day which he prescribed to be kept as a fast. The Jews afterwards
                           appointed many more. (Haydock) --- Maimonides says, this festival was instituted in memory of the descent of Moses from Mount
                           Sinai the third time, when he came to announce to the people that God had pardoned their idolatry. Usher thinks it was in
                           memory of Adam's fall. The Jews still observe it in some degree. As they are not allowed to sacrifice, they kill a white cock,
                           and the women a hen, on the 9th at evening. Those with child kill both. They confess their sins, receive 39 lashes, ask pardon
                           of those whom they have offended, and generally spend the fore part of this month in acts of piety and of penance. (Buxtorf,
