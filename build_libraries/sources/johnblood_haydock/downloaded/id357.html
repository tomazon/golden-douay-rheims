                           &amp;c. These words seem to indicate a degree of impatience, at which we need not be surprised, when we reflect, that Rachel
                           had been educated among idolaters. (Menochius) --- <i>Die</i> of grief and shame. "I shall be considered as one dead." (Jun.[Junius?])
                           St. Chrysostom thinks she threatened to lay violent hands on herself, and through jealousy, spoke in a foolish manner. This
                           passion is capable of the basest actions, (Haydock) and is almost unavoidable where polygamy reigns. (Calmet) </font></p><b>

                           <i>Ruben,</i> now perhaps about four years old, playing in the fields, in the latter <i>harvest</i> time, (Exodus ix. 32)
                           <i>found mandrakes</i> of an extraordinary beauty and <i>flavour,</i> (Canticle of Canticles vii. 13.) whether they were flowers,
                           lilies, jasmine, &amp;c. as some translate; or rather, fruits of the mandrake tree, according to all the ancient versions;
                           or of the citron, lemon, or orange tree, if we believe Calmet. <i>Dudaim</i> designates two breasts, or something lovely and
                           protuberant. The ancients have spoken with admiration, and have attributed wonderful effects to the mandrakes, which, though
                           controverted by moderns, might suffice to make Rachel greatly desire to have them; at least, if she believed they would contribute
                           to remove her sterility, as Pliny, Natural History xxv. 15. Aristotle (de Gener. ii.) and other naturalists of eminence, have
                           maintained they did. (Haydock) --- The effect which she desired so much, was not, however, to be attributed to them, since
                           she conceived only three years after, and that by the blessing of God. (Tirinus)</font></p><b>
