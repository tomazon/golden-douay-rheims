                           As this chapter is almost verbally like to the 5th, 7th, and 12th of St. Matthew, and the 3d of St. Mark, the reader is referred
                           to these for further explanation. --- <i>On the second-first sabbath.</i> An obscure passage, on which St. Jerome says to
                           Nepotianus,[1] that he consulted his master, St. Gregory of Nazianzus, but in vain. St. Chrysostom, Hom. xl. in Matt., takes
                           it for a <i>double feast,</i> or <i>a double rest:</i> by which we may either understand a sabbath, and another feast concurring
                           on the same day; or a sabbath and a feast immediately succeeding to each other. Theophylactus says the same; and that then
                           the latter day, on which they were to rest, was called the <i>second-first.</i> Others say, that when the Jews kept their
                           solemn paschal feast for seven days, the <i>last day</i> was called the <i>second-first,</i> because it was kept with equal
                           solemnity as the first day had been. See Maldonatus. Later interpreters have found out other expositions, of which the most
                           plausible seems to be, that by <i>the second-first sabbath</i> may be understood the <i>feast of Pentecost</i> (which also
                           happened when corn was ripe in Palestine). To understand this we must take notice, that the Jews had three great and solemn
                           feasts: 1. That of the <em>Pasch</em>, or the great paschal feast, with the seven days of <i>unleavened bread;</i> the 2d.
                           was the great <i>feast of Pentecost;</i> and the 3d. was the <i>feast,</i> called of <i>tabernacles.</i> It is supposed then
                           that the <i>paschal feast</i> was called the <i>first-first sabbath,</i> that <i>Pentecost</i> was called the <i>second-first
                           sabbath,</i> and that of <i>tabernacles</i> the <i>third-first,</i> or great <i>sabbath.</i> (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           The Scribes and Pharisees boasted much, as do many modern teachers, of their great knowledge of Scriptures, but our Saviour

                           These twelve Christ chose as individual companions and domestics. To these he committed the charge of founding and governing
                           his Church. He sent them as legates, or ambassadors, (for this is the import of the word <i>apostle</i>) to all the world.
                           Hence their power was more universal than that of bishops, which is confined to their own dioceses or districts. The jurisdiction
                           of the apostles was not limited to place. (Tirinus) --- This power which Jesus Christ delegated to his apostles, and which
                           was for the benefit and regulation of the universal Church in all future ages, the apostles, in their turn, delegated to their
                           successors in the ministry, with such regulations and limitations as have been judged in the Holy Ghost necessary for the
                           proper government of the spiritual kingdom of God upon earth. And it is the height of presumption to question any ordinations
                           that come to us with the authority of the Catholic Church: for, "whatever the Church says, is true; whatever she permits is
                           lawful; whatever she forbids, is evil; whatever she ordains, is holy; whatever she institutes, is good." (St. Augustine) ---
                           How futile then is the objection of Calvin, who pretends, that an apostle, being nothing but a legate, can make no laws, nor
                           prescribe or teach any thing not expressed in his <i>mandatum!</i> (Calvin, Institutes lib. iv. chap. 8)</font></p><b>

                           St. Matthew (v. 3. 10.) mentions eight beatitudes, St. Luke only four; but St. Luke only gives an abridgment in this place
                           of the discourse, which St. Matthew gives more at length. We are also to remark, that in these four the whole eight are comprised,
                           and that both evangelists place poverty in the first place, because it is the first in rank, and, as it were, the parent of
                           the other virtues; for he who hath forsaken earthly possessions, deserves heavenly ones. Neither can any man reasonably expect
                           eternal life, who is not willing to forsake all in affection, and in effect also, if called upon for the love of Jesus Christ.
                           (St. Ambrose) --- Not that every one under great poverty is happy, but that the man who prefers the poverty of Christ to the
                           riches of the world, ought certainly to be esteemed such. Many indeed are poor in worldly substance, but are avaricious in
                           affection; to such as these poverty is no advantage. Nothing that is against the will, merits reward; therefore all virtue
                           is known by the will. Blessed, therefore, are the poor, who bear poverty for the sake of Christ: he himself hath already trodden
                           the path before us, and taught us by his example that it leads to honour and enjoyment. (St. Cyril in St. Thomas Aquinas)</font></p><b>

                           Jesus Christ having declared how meritorious poverty of spirit was to eternal life, proceeds to denounce heavy chastisements
                           upon the rich and proud. (St. Cyril in St. Thomas Aquinas) --- Although in great riches there are great inducements to sin,
                           yet there are not wanting even in that state great incitements to virtue; neither is this woe aimed against those who abound
                           in affluence; but against "those who abuse that affluence which Providence has bestowed upon them: Non enim census, sed affectus,
                           in crimine est." (St. Ambrose)</font></p><b>

                           As before he promised blessings to those that hunger, that weep, that are outcasts for Christ's sake; so here, and in the

                           in present enjoyment, as to become indifferent with regard to the good things of the next world. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Wo to you, when men shall bless you.</i> The ministers of the gospel must not value themselves, when they are applauded
                           by men; for so did the <i>fore-fathers</i> of the Jews, formerly commend the false prophets, when they flattered the people,

                           Jesus Christ does not order us never to refuse a petition: but the meaning of his words is, that we are to give what is just
                           and reasonable, what will be neither injurious to yourself nor your family; for what is unjustly asked, may be justly denied.
                           (St. Augustine, lib. x. chap. 40. de serm. Dom. in Monte.) --- But in this, the sin we commit is often far from trivial; particularly,
                           when to the refusal of a just request, we add also reprehensions and complaints. For why, say we, does he not labour? why
                           has he reduced himself to penury, through his own indolence?---But, tell me, do you live upon the fruits of your own industry?
                           On the supposition that you do, is it not that you may have some plea to reprehend another for the morsel of bread he begs
                           at your hands? You give him no charitable relief, give him then no contumelious words: if you have no compassion for him yourself,
                           do not prevent others from shewing him commiseration. Abraham, in the number of guests he received, had the honour of receiving
                           under his roof even angels. Let us not, therefore, be strict and unfavourable judges in regard of our suffering and distressed
                           neighbours, lest perhaps we ourselves come to be more severely judged. (St. Chrysostom collected from hom. xxi. in ep. ad.
