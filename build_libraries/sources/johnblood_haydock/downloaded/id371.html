                           (Challoner) --- St. Thomas Aquinas, 2, 2, q. 195, a. 7. Hebrew may be translated without attending to the points, "Is not
                           this the cup, out of which my lord drinketh; and he has augured, <I>or</I> discovered, by it the evil which you have committed."
                           Pliny (Natural History xxx. 2.) mentions a method of divining, by means of water in a basin. (Calmet) --- The Egyptians probably
                           supposed, that Joseph used some means to disclose what was hidden; and he alludes, in jest, to their foolish notion. (Haydock)
                           --- He had a right to afflict his guilty brethren; and as for Benjamin, who was innocent, he made him ample recompense for
                           this transitory terror. Some think that the steward said, <I>in which he is wont to divine,</I> unauthorized by his master.

                           It is but just; yet I shall only insist on the detention of the culprit. (Calmet) --- Joseph wished to see whether the marks
                           of attention, which he had shewn to Benjamin, would have excited the envy of his brethren (Menochius); and whether they would
                           be concerned for him: thus he would discover their present dispositions. He might wish also to keep his younger brother out

                                    had committed so heinous a fact?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we brought back to
                                    thee from the land of Chanaan: how then should it be that we should steal out of thy lord's house, gold or silver?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou seekest,
                                    let him die, and we will be the bondmen of my lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And he said to them: Let it be according to your sentence: with whomsoever
                                    it shall be found, let him be my servant, and you shall be blameless.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 Then they speedily took down their sacks to the ground, and every
                                    man opened his sack.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest, and ending at
                                    the youngest, he found the cup in Benjamin's sack.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 Then they rent their garments, and loading their asses again, returned
                                    into the town.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph (for he was
                                    not yet gone out of the place) and they all together fell down before him on the ground.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And he said to them: Why would you do so? know you not that there
                                    is no one like me in the science of divining.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And Juda said to him: What shall we answer my lord? or what shall
                                    we say, or be able justly to allege? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen to my lord,
                                    both we, and he with whom the cup was found.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Joseph answered: God forbid that I should do so: he that stole the
                                    cup, he shall be my bondman: and go you away free to your father.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Then Juda coming nearer, said boldly: I beseech thee, my lord, let
                                    thy servant speak a word in thy ears, and be not angry with thy servant: for after Pharao thou art,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 My lord. *Thou didst ask thy servants the first time: Have you a father
                                    or a brother.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And we answered thee, my lord: We have a father an old man, and a
                                    young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead; and he alone is left of his mother, and his
                                    father loveth him tenderly.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him hither to me, and I will
                                    set my eyes on him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot leave his father: for if he
                                    leave him, he will die.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 *And thou saidst to thy servants: Except your youngest brother come
                                    with you, you shall see my face no more.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father, we told
                                    him all that my lord had said.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And our father said: Go again, and buy us a little wheat.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And we said to him: We cannot go: if our youngest brother go down
                                    with us, we will set out together: otherwise, without him we dare not see the man's face.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bore me two.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 One went out, and you said: *A beast devoured him; and hitherto he
                                    appeareth not.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 If you take this also, and any thing befall him in the way, you will
                                    bring down my grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 Therefore, if I shall go to thy servant, our father, and the boy be
                                    wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him)</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 And he shall see that he is not with us, he will die, and thy servants
                                    shall bring down his grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 Let me be thy proper servant, who took him into my trust, and promised,
                                    saying: *If I bring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against my father for ever.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 Therefore I, thy servant, will stay instead of the boy in the service
                                    of my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I be a witness
                                    of the calamity that will oppress my father.</font></p>
