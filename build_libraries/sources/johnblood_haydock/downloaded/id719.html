                           was become again very rich and strong, (Calmet) and gloried in its wisdom; yet was taken after a long and obstinate resistance
                           (Haydock) of seven months, when the inhabitants were slain or sold, the city demolished, and the ships sunk. (Curt. iv.; Usher,
                           year of the world 3672.) --- <i>Sidon</i> made no resistance, as it hated the Persians. Yet Strato was forced to resign the

                           (Challoner) --- Many pagans devoured the victims raw, and drank the blood of their enemies. These marks of cruelty and superstition
                           shall cease when they adopt the law of Moses, Genesis ix. 4., and Leviticus vii. 26,. and xvii. 11. --- <i>Governor,</i> or

                           holy place, and Crassus plundered the treasury. Both felt the effects of their impiety, and had no farther success. --- <i>Oppressor;</i>
                           tax-gatherer, (Haydock) sent by foreign tyrants. (Menochius) --- Till the Machabees, particularly Hircan, (Calmet) or Simon,

                           --- If the Jews had not wilfully blinded themselves, they could not mistake Him, as he is here so minutely described, possessing
                           the most humble and the noblest qualities. Not knowing how to reconcile them, they feign one Messias glorious and another
                           poor and despised; while others admit only of one, and reject either the abject or the exalted things which the prophets have
                           spoken of him. The Church alone can reconcile these apparent contradictions in our Saviour's character. After predicting what
                           would befall the Jews till about one hundred years before the birth of Christ, the prophet turns to Him who was the desire
