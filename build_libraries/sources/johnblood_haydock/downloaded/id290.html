                           sooner had St. John received in the preceding vision the documents he was to transmit to the seven Churches of Asia[Asia Minor],
                           when, behold, a new scene displays itself. Heaven opens, and St. John is invited up thither by the voice which had spoken
                           to him before, and is told he shall see what is to happen in future ages. On a sudden appears a throne, and the Almighty himself
                           seated upon it. The rainbow which surrounds the throne, denotes the covenant of reconciliation and peace between God and man.
                           (Walmesley) --- <I>Behold a door open.</I> Here begins what may be looked upon as the second part of the Apocalypse, and from
                           hence to the two last chapters are contained wars and victories of the Church over all its enemies, the devil, Jews, heathens,
                           and heretics.&nbsp; These visions are so differently expounded, when applied to different events, that this alone may convince
                           us how uncertain are those various interpretations. The servants of God are taught that they must expect to meet with many
                           trials, afflictions, and persecutions; but this ought to be a great subject of consolation to the faithful, that they are
                           assured of victory if they fight manfully, and of a recompense of endless happiness for their short labours. Such visions
                           and majestic descriptions shew that St. John was inspired by the same spirit of God, as the ancient patriarchs and prophets.
                           --- <I>I will shew thee the things which must come to pass hereafter;</I> i.e. after the things already revealed concerning
                           the seven Churches, and therefore after the destruction of Jerusalem, which was about twenty years before St. John wrote this

                           the throne were four and twenty seats,</I> or lesser thrones, with twenty-four seniors or senators upon them, representing
                           the illustrious saints both of the Old and New Testament, <I>clothed in white garments,</I> in token of their innocence, and
                           crowns of gold, signifying the glory of the heavenly inhabitants. (Witham) --- These four and twenty elders sitting round
                           the throne of God, represent the judgment which the Almighty was about to pass upon the enemies of his Church. Thus in Daniel,
                           when he was about to pronounce sentence against Antiochus Epiphanes, "thrones were placed, and the ancient of days sat,...the
                           judgment sat, and the books were opened." (Daniel vii. 9, 10.) They represent kings and priests who attend on the Sovereign
                           Judge. It appears as if God intended to designate by the number the ancient patriarchs and the twelve apostles, who judge
                           with the Lord, and condemn the injustice of their persecutors. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           that attend his throne. See chap. i. 4. (Witham) --- The lightnings, loud voices, and thunders, which come from the throne
                           of God, announce alarms and severe hardships, such as persecutions, heresies, calamities, &amp;c. by which he tries the fidelity
                           of his servants on earth. And the seven spirits of God, who appear under the form of burning lamps, are seven Angels, as before
                           mention, (Chap. i. 4.) standing ready to execute the divine commands. (Walmesley)</FONT></P><B>

                           sea of glass, like crystal,</I> calm and transparent, and may signify that the saints had passed a boisterous sea of troubles
                           in this world, which is now changed into everlasting tranquillity. --- <I>Four living creatures,</I> or animals. Alcazar (p.
                           364) takes notice of thirty different expositions of these animals. He understands the apostles, bishops, and preachers of
                           the Christian faith: others, four of the chief Angels or celestial spirits. Several others expound them of the four evangelists:
                           yet this was before St. John himself had written his gospel. (Witham) --- The extensive sea of glass, here described transparent
                           as crystal, represents what may be called the floor of heaven. Before the throne and round it stand four living creatures,
                           of an extraordinary shape, which denote the four great prophets, Isaias, Jeremias, Ezechiel, and Daniel. Their bodies are
                           described full of eyes, both before and behind, an emblem of their prophetic sight, that penetrates into all ages past, present,
                           and to come. And their being also full of eyes within, indicates that their extensive knowledge arises from an interior divine
                           inspiration. They have each six wings, in the same manner as the seraphim appeared to the prophet Isaias. (Chap. vi. 2.) Some
                           have imagined these four symbolical animals to represent the four evangelists; but we think improperly, as St. John was still
                           living and there present in person. The first animal is here said to resemble a lion, the king of beasts, because the prophet
                           Isaias, represented by it, was descended of the royal race of David. The second animal resembles a calf, and represents the
                           prophet Jeremias in his character of priest; the calf, which was the principal victim in Jewish sacrifices, being on that
                           account the emblem of the priesthood. The third animal, exhibiting Ezechiel, has the countenance of a man; because God, in
                           speaking to that prophet, always addresses him by the name of son of man. The fourth animal, denoting Daniel, resembles a
                           flying eagle, on account of the sublime oracles of this prophet, who soars to the highest objects, and views the succession
                           of all the great empires that were to rise up in the world to the end of time. Probably these four principal prophets are
                           to be understood to represent all the prophets of the old law. (Walmesley)</FONT></P><B>
