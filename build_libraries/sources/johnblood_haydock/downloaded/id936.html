                           <i>David.</i> This name is written without <i>i,</i> in the books composed before the captivity, (the year before Christ 588)
                           but <i>i</i> is inserted in the latter works, which is an argument against the antiquities of [Canticle of] Canticles, where
                           the <i>i</i> is found. Yet the manuscripts vary so, that great stress is not laid on this (Kennicott) proof, and it is not
                           sufficient weight to stand against the general opinion, which attributes that work to Solomon. (Haydock) --- <i>Hebron,</i>

                           <i>Which he spoke,</i> is not expressed in Hebrew or Septuagint. Samuel complied with the injunction, by anointing David,
                           1 Kings xvi. 13. He also wrote an account of this memorable transaction, which translated the sceptre from one family to another.
                           (Haydock) --- It is, on this account, that the author here takes particular notice of God's decree. (Kennicott)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Here.</i> In 2 Kings v. 6, the passage is much fuller, and attended with many difficulties. Kennicott would correct and
                           translate it: "And they spake unto David, saying, Thou shalt not come hither: for the blind and the lame shall keep thee off,
                           by saying, David shall not come hither. But David took the stronghold of Sion," (different from the citadel. Josephus) "which
                           is the city of David. And David said, on that day, whosoever (first) smiteth the Jebusites, and, through the subterraneous
                           passage, reacheth the blind and the lame, which are hated of David's soul, because the blind and the lame continued to say,
                           he shall not come into this house---shall be head and captain. So Joab, the son of Zeruiah, went up first, and was head."</font></p><b>

                           <i>Round.</i> He made a complete inclosure or fortification, as <i>Mello</i> denotes perfection, or completion, (Haydock)
                           by building houses from the castle to the town beneath it. David begun at the very house (or citadel, 4 Kings xii. 20.) from
                           which the blind and the lame thought to have excluded him, and built all round, so as to make an entire communication. (Kennicott)
                           --- <i>Built.</i> Protestants, "repaired." Hebrew <i>yechaye,</i> (Haydock) "saved alive." (Syriac, &amp;c.; Poole's Synop.)
                           But probably <i>shear</i> is now written instead of <i>shor,</i> and <font size="3"><em>j</em></font><font face="Times New

                           <i>jeje.</i> The long and the short <i>e</i> are easily confounded, (Haydock) and <i>a</i> is frequently thus inserted. (Watson)
                           --- "He built....round to the beginning of that circuit. And Joab was made governor of the city." (Kennicott) --- "And surrounding
                           it with a wall, he appointed Joab superintendant of the walls." (Josephus, [Antiquities?] vii. 3.) --- The position of the
                           vowel points in these words, might naturally cause this mistake, (Haydock) as it seems to have done on other occasions. Thus
                           <i>shor,</i> "an ox," should be <i>sar,</i> "a prince," Genesis xlix. 6., and Osee xii. 11. <i>Shevarim,</i> "oxen," has been
                           read <i>sarim,</i> "princes," by the Septuagint. The former passage might admit of some corrections. "In their anger they
                           slew the men, and in their fury (<i>vabrothom;</i> instead of <i>vabrotsnom,</i> which is always explained in a good sense)
                           they destroyed the princes. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their fury, for it was inflexible."</font></p><b>

                           author frequently recedes from the Protestant version, as well as from the printed Hebrew, both of which are frequently erroneous.
                           Perhaps the critical examination of these proper names, may appear to some unimportant. But the question respecting the perfect
                           integrity of the Hebrew text deserves to be seriously considered; and every part of sacred history requires our attention.
                           If the Protestant rule of faith be incorrect, what security can they have? We are not exposed to the same inconvenience, even
                           though the Vulgate be susceptible of farther improvement. (Haydock)</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>
