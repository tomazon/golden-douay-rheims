                           was now no longer obligatory. Some weak Christians, converted from among the Jews, as we here gather from the apostle, made
                           a scruple of eating such meats as were deemed unclean by the law: such as swine's flesh, &amp;c. which the stronger sort of
                           Christians did eat without scruple. Now the apostle, to reconcile them together, exhorts the former not to judge or condemn
                           the latter, using their Christian liberty; and the latter to take care not to despise, or scandalize their weaker brethren,
                           either by bringing them to eat what in their conscience they think they should not: or by giving them such offence, as to
                           endanger the driving them thereby from the Christian religion. (Challoner) --- <I>For one</I> that is not so weak, but well

                           meats being no longer obligatory under the new law of Christ. He that is weak, and not convinced of this Christian liberty,
                           let him <I>eat herbs,</I> or such things as he esteems not forbidden. It is likely some of them abstained many times from
                           all manner of flesh, lest they should meet with what had been offered to idols, or lest something forbidden by the law might
                           be mixed. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           bound to fast, or abstain from flesh on certain days. The apostle speaks only of the distinction of meats, called <I>clean</I>
                           and <I>unclean,</I> and of <I>fasts</I> or <I>feasts</I> peculiar to the law of Moses. It does not follow from hence, that
                           the Catholic Church hath not power to command days of fasting, and abstaining, for self-denial or humiliation. (Witham) ---
                           The apostle here treats only of the subject in hand, viz. the Mosaic distinctions of clean and unclean meats: and in this
                           he allows, for that present time, each one to follow his own private judgment. St. Chrysostom observes that St. Paul did not
                           wish the weak to be left to their own judgment in this, as in a point of no consequence; but that they should wait for a time.
                           The converts were not immediately prohibited their accustomed practices, but they were tolerated in them for a while, till
                           fully instructed. This we see in many of the converts at Jerusalem, who were still observers of the Mosaic ordinances; this
                           was tolerated, that the synagogue might be buried with honour. (Estius)</FONT></P><B>

                           of the prophet Isaias: "As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bend before me, and every tongue shall confess to God."
                           (Isaias chap. xlv.) Thus shall all acknowledge the power, the divinity, and sovereign dominion of Christ, by bending the knee;

                           elect: but we here learn from St. Paul, that they for whom Christ shed his blood and suffered the death of the cross, may
