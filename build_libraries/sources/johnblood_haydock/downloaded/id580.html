                           of the word <i>zona,</i> which occurs [in] Josue ii. 1, and is applied to Rahab. This woman seems to have been of the same
                           profession. Gaza was one of the strongest towns of the Philistines, on the south of the country. Some have erroneously supposed,
                           (Calmet) that it was so called from a Persian word, which signifies a treasury, as Cambyses there deposited his most valuable

                           when it is day, we shall kill him." They hoped to seize him unawares, (Haydock) as they were afraid to rouse this lion, and
                           hence probably refrained from setting fire to the house: (Calmet) though they might be deterred from doing this, by the fear
                           of the conflagration spreading to other parts of the city, (Haydock) and by an over-ruling Providence. (Salien)</font></p><b></b>

                           as to require a sort of a key, and not to be opened but on the inside. Hebron was above thirty miles distant: but travellers
                           mention a small hill, where they say the doors were left in the vicinity of Gaza; (Calmet) and the text does not assert that
                           Samson carried them as far as Hebron. (Haydock) --- He went out by that gate, contrary to the expectations of the Philistines,
                           who supposed that he would go towards Thamnatha. If any saw him, none durst encounter the hero, as they had not yet forgotten
                           the thousand slain with the jaw-bone. (Salien) --- The pagans confound their Hercules with Samson; (St. Augustine, City of
                           God xviii. 19.) but the former durst not attack two at a time, whereas the latter engaged and slew so many. (Worthington)</font></p><b></b>

                           <i>After this.</i> The lamentable fall of Samson took place in the last year of his administration, when Heli, of the house
                           of Thamar, succeeded Achitob I. in the high priesthood. (In the year before Christ 1154. Salien) --- <i>Sorec</i> was not
                           far from Saraa, where Samson was born. It probably belonged to the Philistines, as Dalila is generally supposed to have been
                           of that nation, and most people believe a harlot. (Calmet) --- Adrichomius says the eunuch was here baptized. (Tirinus) ---
                           <i>Dalila.</i> Some are of opinion she was married to Samson; others that she was his harlot. If the latter opinion be true,
                           we cannot wonder that, in punishment of his lust, the Lord delivered him up by her means into the hands of his enemies. However,
                           if he was guilty, it is not to be doubted, but that under his afflictions, he heartily repented and returned to God, and so
                           obtained forgiveness of his sins. (Challoner) --- <i>Dolol</i> means, "to be impoverished or weakened," as Samson was in all
                           respects by this wicked woman.</font></p><b></b>

                           <i>Princes,</i> (<i>seranim;</i>) the five satraps, who had the chief sway in the nation, either came in person or sent messengers
                           to Cephar-Sorec. They were convinced that the strength of Samson was supernatural; but they wished to learn whether it depended
                           on some magical charm, or on some religious observation, or whether he was vulnerable only in some particular part, like Achilles,
                           who could only be slain by a wound in the heel, according to the pagans. (Calmet) --- If Dalila would learn, and endeavour
                           to remove the obstacle, these princes engaged to give her each 1100 <i>pieces</i> (or sicles, Calmet) <i>of silver.</i> (Salien)</font></p><b></b>

                           <i>Her,</i> in jest. (Haydock) --- <i>Sinews;</i> such were frequently used for strength. (Vegetius iv. 9.; Psalm x. 2) Cato
                           often speaks of <i>loreos funes,</i> (Calmet) or "leathern thongs." (Haydock) --- <i>Moist.</i> Hebrew, "seven bands, green
                           and moist;" as if he were speaking of willow twigs, or bands made of the rind of trees, &amp;c. But we need not abandon the
                           Septuagint and Vulgate to follow the moderns in this place, as <i>yetharim</i> unquestionably means cords of sinews, and the
                           epithet, <i>green,</i> is applied to the eyes of Moses, (Deuteronomy xxiv. 7.) to denote their shining vigour and strength;
                           so here it may signify, that the sinews were to be fresh and in full perfection. (Calmet) --- Dalila might easily think that
                           such bands would make Samson her prisoner. She had people to assist her, in case she proved successful. But Samson probably
                           broke the bands before they made their appearance; otherwise he would have resented the woman's infidelity, and not exposed
                           himself again. He supposed she only made these exclamations to see what he would do, ver. 9., &amp;c.</font></p><b></b>

                           <i>Lace,</i> (<i>licio;</i>) "the woof about the beam," &amp;c. Hebrew, "the web, (<b>14</b>) and she fastened <i>it,</i>"
                           &amp;c. The original text is here imperfect. (Haydock) --- The Septuagint have preserved eighteen words, which have been omitted
                           in Hebrew, "the web, (and fastened them with a pin unto the wall, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. (<b>14</b>)
                           And it came to pass, when he slept, that Dalilia took seven locks of his head, and wove them with a web) and fastened them
                           with a pin, (unto the wall) and said," &amp;c. (Kennicott, Diss. ii.) --- The Vulgate expresses the whole idea in fewer words:
                           but the Hebrew leaves the proposal of Samson imperfect. It is observable that Grabe's edition of the Alexandrian Septuagint
                           has no mark of any thing being redundant; whence we might suppose, that in the days of Origen, (whose marks he endeavours
                           to exhibit) the Hebrew agreed with the Greek version: but the 14th verse is rather different from the Vatican copy, which
                           has been given above. --- "And Dalila (so the Septuagint always style her) lulled him asleep; (<i><u>ekoimisen</u>,</i> as
                           [in] ver. 19, (Haydock) perhaps by giving him some potion, with which people of her character are frequently provided; Salien)
                           and she wove the seven curls of his head with the wool, (<i><u>ektaseos</u></i>) and she fastened them with the pins of wood
                           into the wall," &amp;c. (Haydock) --- The Hebrew text is liable to many difficulties, says Calmet; "If thou shalt make a tissue
                           of seven locks of my head with the veil, which thou weavest, and shalt fasten it to a nail, I shall become weak as another
                           man: <i>or,</i> If thou weave together my hair and my thread," &amp;c. The ancients were accustomed to weave standing. Samson
                           was probably lying on the ground, while Dalila was acting this farce. (Calmet)</font></p><b></b>

                           <i>Death.</i> Hebrew, "and pressed him so, that his soul was straitened unto death." It would be well if Christians would
                           always make as stout a resistance against manifest temptations to sin, as Samson did on this occasion, when he might consider
                           the revealing of the truth rather as an indiscretion than as a crime. It is difficult to determine in what precisely the fault
                           consisted, which was followed by so severe a punishment. Perhaps he may have been placed as a pattern of patience, like holy
                           Job, without incurring the divine displeasure. Yet most people suppose, that he fell by the love of women, and by disclosing
                           the secret of his strength. But where do we read that he had received a precept from God, not to mention it even to his <i>wife?</i>
                           For in this light Sts. Ephrem and Chrysostom, Sulp Severus, Pererius, and others, represent Dalila, which removes the greatest
                           objection to his character. We have seen (ver. 1) that the <i>harlot</i> of Gaza might be only an innkeeper; and the first
                           object of his love, was proposed to him by the holy spirit, chap. xiv. 4. But even allowing that Dalila was a harlot, though
                           the Scripture does not assert it, what harm was there in Samson's endeavouring to reclaim her, and to make her his wife, as
                           Osee (i. 2.) was commanded to do? It is only said, (ver. 4) the <i>he loved a woman;</i> and his subsequent conduct with her,
                           might be nothing more than what is lawful among lovers, or even commendable between married people. Isaac's <i>playing with
                           Rebecca, his wife,</i> (Genesis xxvi. 8.) was a proof of his conjugal love for her, as St. Francis de Sales observes. Generous
                           souls are frequently prone to love, and delight to unbend their minds in the company of the fair sex, with whom they can fear
                           no rivalship in strength. Samson, in particular, seemed unable to deny their importunate requests. He yielded at last to explain
                           his riddle to his first wife, and though he was justly offended at her infidelity, he took occasion from it to begin the work
                           for which he was sent by God, the destruction of the enemy. Perhaps he thought that his compliance with the repeated solicitations
                           of Dalila would be attended with the like effect, as in reality it was, and he destroyed more in death than during the whole
                           course of his life. Without the strongest proofs, it seems unjust to pass sentence of condemnation upon a great character,
                           the number of the perfect being already too small. Our Saviour, laden with the sins of mankind, as with the treacherous Dalila,
                           exclaimed, <i>my soul is sorrowful unto death,</i> Matthew xxvi. 38. Yet (Haydock) the weakness of Samson's heart throughout
                           this history, is still more surprising than the strength of his body. (Calmet) --- Tirinus asserts that God had granted him
                           such strength, with an order not to disclose the secret, that it was attached to the not wilfully having his hair cut.</font></p><b></b>

                           Samson's greatest misfortune, and rendered him less formidable than if he had been bound with chains of adamant. He was not

                           <i>Let me die.</i> Literally, <i>let my soul die.</i> Samson did not sin on this occasion, though he was indirectly the cause
                           of his own death. Because he was moved to what he did, by a particular inspiration of God, who also concurred with him by
                           a miracle, in restoring his strength upon the spot, in consequence of his prayer. Samson, by dying in this manner, was a figure
                           of Christ, who by his death overcame all his enemies. (Challoner; Worthington) --- St. Augustine says, "he was not under a
                           human delusion, but divinely inspired....Who will accuse his obedience?" (De C.[City of God?]&nbsp;i. 21., and 26., &amp;c.)
                           And St. Bernard (de præc. 3.) observes that he would have sinned, if he had not received a particular inspiration. But many
                           think that he might have acted as he did, without it, in quality of judge, as he might intend primarily to avenge his people
                           and the glory of God. He was willing to sacrifice his life for this purpose, though he would have preserved it, if it had
                           been in his power. (Cajetan; Lessius, &amp;c) --- The Church honours many virgin martyrs, (Calmet) who have thrown themselves
                           into fire or water, in similar dispositions. St. Ambrose says, "it is to be presumed that their zeal came from God." (De Virg.
                           iii. 7.) He mentions St. Pelagia, and her mother and sisters, and St. Soteris, a relation of his, whose memory is honoured
                           on the 10th of February. St. Apollonia's feast occurs the day before. "She leapt into the fire, having her breast enkindled
                           with a stronger flame of the holy spirit. (Brev. Rom. [Roman Breviary?]) See the fact of Razias, 2 Machabees xiv. 37. (Haydock)
                           --- So that the revelation of St. Mathildes doubting of his, Solomon's, Origen's, and Trajan's salvation, as if God would
                           thus keep mankind in fear, seems to be a fabrication. (Baronius. A.D. 604.) St. Paul ranks Samson among the saints, Hebrews
                           xi. 32. --- <i>Life.</i> Express mention is made of 1030 slain by Samson, besides the great numbers, which excited the <i>astonishment</i>
                           of the Philistines, chap. xv. 8. But on this occasion he destroyed 3000 at once, and the death of all the princes made the
                           slaughter more terrible, (Calmet) insomuch that the people being without a head, were glad to let Samson's brethren take away
                           his body without molestation, as they have every reason to fear that the Israelites would now fall upon them. (Salien) ---
                           If 3000 perished on the outside of the temple, (Haydock) Serarius concludes that not less than 20,000 were destroyed in all.</font></p><b></b>

                           (Drusius) --- Some refuse the Samson the title of judge, (Masius) as they suppose (Haydock) that Heli filled that office at
                           the same time. But there might be several in different parts of the country, and Heli might administer sacred things, while
                           Samson acted in the character of a warrior. (Calmet) --- Salien believes that Heli only commenced high priest and judge at
                           the death of Samson, and continued for 40 years, though he was 58 years old when he entered upon office, in the year of the
                           world 2900, in the year before Christ 1153. Samson prefigured the Messias, not only in death, but also in his annunciation,
                           birth, name, and in many particulars of his life. He was a Nazarite: Jesus receives that title even from his enemies. Samson
                           marries a foreign woman; is delivered by his brethren of Juda into the hands of his enemies; judges and delivers his people.
                           Christ, the sun of justice, calls the Gentiles; is betrayed by Judas, and abandoned to the fury of the Romans; is appointed
                           Judge and Saviour of all. He embraces the cross, as Samson did the pillars, and by his humiliations redeemed the world. The
                           pagan temple falls and crushes the idolaters. The Jews are overwhelmed in the ruins of their temple and city; and the earth
                           trembles at the death of Christ. He is buried with honour, notwithstanding the malice of his enemies, (Calmet) as the body
                           of Samson was taken from the midst of the raging inhabitants of Gaza, and interred peaceably in his father's tomb. The fabulous
                           account of the Ph&#339;nician, or of another (Haydock) Hercules, who lived about this time, seems to have been chiefly taken
                           from the history of Samson. Both encountered many difficulties, and perished by&nbsp;woman's malice. Hercules never used a
                           sword, and we do not read that Samson had any. (Calmet) --- "He was possessed of an incomparable strength both of mind and
                           body, says Josephus, ([Antiquities?] v. 10,) which he employed for the destruction of the enemy even to the last breath. His
                           being deceived by a woman, we ought to attribute to human weakness, which is prone to such faults. In all other respects,
                           his virtue entitles him to eternal praise." (Haydock)</font></p>

                                    which looketh towards Hebron.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 After this he loved a woman, *who dwelt in the valley of Sorec, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And the princes of the Philistines came to her, and said: Deceive him,
                                    and learn of him wherein his great strength lieth, and how we may be able to overcome him, to bind and afflict him: which
                                    if thou shalt do, we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And Dalila said to Samson: Tell me, I beseech thee, wherein thy greatest
                                    strength lieth, and what it is, wherewith if thou wert bound, thou couldst not break loose.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And Samson answered her: If I shall be bound with seven cords, made
                                    of sinews not yet dry, but still moist, I shall be weak like other men.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And the princes of the Philistines brought unto her seven cords, such
                                    as he spoke of, with which she bound him;</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Men lying privately in wait with her, and in the chamber, expecting
                                    the event of the thing, and she cried out to him: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he broke the bands, as a man
                                    would break a thread of tow, when it smelleth the fire: so it was not known wherein his strength lay.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And Dalila said to him: Behold thou hast mocked me, and hast told
                                    me a false thing: but now at least tell me wherewith thou mayest be bound.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And he answered her: If I shall be bound with new ropes, that were
                                    never in work, I shall be weak and like other men.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 Dalila bound him again with these, and cried out: The Philistines
                                    are upon thee, Samson, there being an ambush prepared for him in the chamber. But he broke the bands like threads of webs.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And Dalila said to him again: How long dost thou deceive me, and tell
                                    me lies? Shew me wherewith thou mayest be bound. And Samson answered her: If thou plattest the seven locks of my head with
                                    a lace, and tying them round about a nail, fastenest it in the ground, I shall be weak.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And when Dalila had done this, she said to him: The Philistines are
                                    upon thee, Samson. And awaking out of his sleep, he drew out the nail with the hairs and the lace.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And Dalila said to him: How dost thou say thou lovest me, when thy
                                    mind is not with me? Thou hast told me lies these three times, and wouldst not tell me wherein thy great strength lieth.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And when she pressed him much, and continually hung upon him for many
                                    days, giving him no time to rest, his soul fainted away, and was wearied even unto death.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Then opening the truth of the thing, he said to her: The razor hath
                                    never come upon my head, for I am a Nazarite, that is to say, consecrated to God from my mother's womb: If my head be shaven,
                                    my strength shall depart from me, and I shall become weak, and shall be like other men.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Then seeing that he had discovered to her all his mind, she sent to
                                    the princes of the Philistines, saying: Come up this once more, for now he hath opened his heart to me. And they went up,
                                    taking with them the money which they had promised.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 But she made him sleep upon her knees, and lay his head in her bosom.
                                    And she called a barber, and shaved his seven locks, and began to drive him away, and thrust him from her: for immediately
                                    his strength departed from him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And she said: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And awaking from
                                    sleep, he said in his mind: I will go out as I did before, and shake myself, not knowing that the Lord was departed from him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 Then the Philistines seized upon him, and forthwith pulled out his
                                    eyes, and led him bound in chains to Gaza, and shutting him up in prison made him grind.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And now his hair began to grow again,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And the princes of the Philistines assembled together, to offer great
                                    sacrifices to Dagon, their god, and to make merry, saying: Our god hath delivered our enemy Samson into our hands.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And the people also seeing this, praised their god, and said the same:
                                    Our god hath delivered our adversary into our hands, him that destroyed our country, and killed very many.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And rejoicing in their feasts, when they had now taken their good
                                    cheer, they commanded that Samson should be called, and should play before them. And being brought out of prison, he played
                                    before them; and they made him stand between two pillars.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And he said to the lad that guided his steps: Suffer me to touch the
                                    pillars which support the whole house, and let me lean upon them, and rest a little.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 Now the house was full of men and women, and all the princes of the
                                    Philistines were there. Moreover about three thousand persons of both sexes, from the roof and the higher part of the house,
                                    were beholding Samson's play.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 But he called upon the Lord, saying: O Lord God remember me, and restore
                                    to me now my former strength, O my God, that I may revenge myself on my enemies, and for the loss of my two eyes I may take
                                    one revenge.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And laying hold on both the pillars on which the house rested, and
                                    holding the one with his right hand, and the other with his left,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 He said: Let me die with the Philistines. And when he had strongly
                                    shook the pillars, the house fell upon all the princes, and the rest of the multitude, that was there: and he killed many
                                    more at his death, than he had killed before in his life.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 And his brethren and all his kindred, going down took his body, and
                                    buried it between Saraa and Esthaol, in the burying-place of his father Manue: and he judged Israel twenty years.</font></p>
