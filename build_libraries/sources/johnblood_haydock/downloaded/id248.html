                           promised them, unless they steadily believe and obey the gospel of Jesus Christ. The reason why so few profit of the word,
                           is because few take care to meditate on it, to digest it, and as it were, incorporate it with themselves by proper considerations.</FONT></P><B>

                           It is faith that opens heaven; but faith animated by charity, nourished by good works, and perfected by mortification of the
                           senses. God only enters into his rest after the accomplishment of his works, and shall we expect to enter before we accomplish
                           what he has given us to do? Let us fear, but in hoping; let us hope, but in labouring. --- <I>The works....were finished.</I>[1]
                           This place is the same, and equally obscure in the Greek as in the Latin text. The apostle here examines what David, as a
                           prophet, could mean, when he said of some: they shall not enter, or, <I>if they shall enter into my rest.</I> His argument
                           is this: David could not prophesy of that <I>rest,</I> by which God, after he had created all things, (Genesis ii. 2.) is
                           said to have rested <I>the seventh day,</I> when he had finished the works of the creation. Nor could David speak of that
                           other time of <I>resting,</I> which was promised and given to the Israelites, when, having conquered all their enemies, they
                           were introduced by <I>Jesus,</I> or Josue[Joshua], into the promised land of Chanaan[Canaan]; for these two rests were passed
                           long before his prophecy: therefore David must speak of some rest that was to come afterwards, when he said: <I>To-day, if
                           you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts,</I> &amp;c. Therefore it must needs follow that some <I>day</I> of <I>rest,</I>
                           some sabbatism, as he calls it, after his time, must remain for the <I>people of God,</I> that should not harden their hearts:
                           and from hence he concludes that David had in view that eternal rest of happiness which the Messias was to obtain for us,
                           a rest without end in the kingdom of heaven. --- <I>Let us hasten, therefore,</I> or as it is in the Greek, <I>let us make
                           it our endeavour,</I> to gain that place of <I>rest,</I> by our persevering in faith and good works, and take heed not to
                           be excluded with the unbelievers. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           the word of God is living,</I> &amp;c. Some understand by <I>the word of God,</I> the eternal word, or Son of God: (to whom
                           may apply all in the 12th and 13th verses) but others rather expound it of the words, promises, and menaces of God, either
                           foretold by the prophets, or preached by the apostles. (Witham) --- All this language is metaphorical, but perfectly well
                           understood by the Jews. In their sacrifices, the Levites made use of a two-edged knife to separate from the victim what was
                           for God, what was for the priests, and what was for the people. Thus in sacrificing sinners to the justice of God, Jesus Christ,
                           like a two-edged knife, will separate what is for God, and what is for man; i.e. whatever is good or evil in the whole of
                           man's conduct.</FONT></P><B>

                           us often contemplate Jesus Christ on his two thrones, that of his <I>mercy,</I> and that of his <I>justice;</I> of his mercy,
                           where at present he is seated as our compassionate high priest, to bestow on us the riches of his grace; of his justice, where
                           he will one day sit as judge, to examine most rigorously both our faith and our practice. Our separated brethren pretend to
                           prove from this text that we need no help of saints to obtain any favour. But by this argument they may as well take away
                           the helps and prayers of the living for one another. For we do not require the help of either the saints in heaven, or of
                           our brethren on earth, through any mistrust of God's mercy, but on account of our own unworthiness, convinced that the prayer
                           of a just man availeth more with Him, than the desire of a grievous sinner; and of a number making intercession together,
                           rather than of one alone. This they cannot deny, except they deny the holy Scriptures. Neither do we come less to Him, or
                           with less confidence, when we come accompanied with the prayers of Angels, saints, priests, or just men, with us, as they
                           fondly imagine and pretend; but with much more confidence in his grace, mercy, and merits, than if we prayed ourselves alone.

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus: *And God rested
