                           order to form a throne for God, and bending towards Him, with profound respect. Others only admit their heads, with six wings:
                           while many suppose, that they resembled those compounded figures mentioned, Ezechiel i. 5. and x. 20. They denote some extraordinary

                           represent the saints, Apocalypse v. 8, 10. The different forms under which they appear, set before us their various perfections.
                           Their wings denote agility, &amp;c. The Egyptians adored Anubis, under the form of a man, with a dog's head. Isis had the

                           enigmatical. God condescended perhaps to satisfy the inclinations of his people, by representing the mysteries of religion
                           under similar forms, Wisdom xviii. 24. (Calmet) --- Would he have allowed such things, if they were so dangerous, as to be
