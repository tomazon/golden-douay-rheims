                           died.</I> The Rabbins say four months before Saul. (Seder, olam 13.) (Tirinus) --- Others believe about two years; and suppose
                           that he was 98 years old, twenty of which he had been judge: (Calmet) Salien says 38, and that he lived seventy-seven years.
                           (Menochius) --- On all these points the learned are divided, chap. vii. 15. They are more unanimous in praising (Haydock)
                           the conduct of this most holy statesman. Grotius compares him with Aristides. (Calmet) --- But he Holy Ghost gives Samuel
                           a far more glorious character, Ecclesiasticus xlvi. 16., &amp;c. (Haydock) --- Both he and his mother are figures of the two
                           testaments. Anna becomes fruitful --- Samuel is substituted in the place of Heli. The sterility of Anna represents the incapacity
                           of the Synagogue, to produce living and virtuous children. She bears Samuel, the figure of Jesus Christ, who reunites in his
                           person the royal and the sacerdotal dignity. But under another point of view, Samuel, how perfect soever, must give place
                           to the more perfect David, the glorious type of Jesus Christ, and thus the Synagogue, notwithstanding all her prerogatives,
                           must yield to the Church. See St. Augustine, de C.[City of God?] xvii. 1, 4. Many of the ancients have looked upon Samuel
                           as the high priest: but the generality have acknowledged that he was only a Levite, (Calmet) or an extraordinary priest, like
                           Moses. (Haydock) --- <I>All Israel,</I> or many from every tribe, assembled to attend his funeral; (Tirinus) and all mourned
                           for him, as they had done for Moses and Aaron. (Salien) --- <I>House,</I> or among his kindred, (Tirinus) in a place which
                           he had chosen for his tomb. This is called <I>the house</I> of the wicked <I>for ever;</I> but the just raise their hopes
                           much higher, and await a more splendid palace above, and a glorious resurrection. (Haydock) --- They would not bury Samuel
                           in his dwelling-house, as it could not then be entered without incurring an uncleanness. (Calmet) --- His bones were translated
                           with great respect to Constantinople, and a noble mausoleum was built for them by the emperor Justinian. (Procop. v.; St.
                           Jerome, contra Vigil.) (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           expression, he specifies his enemies, if he do not punish Nabal. --- <I>Leave.</I> David certainly sinned in his designs against
                           Nabal and his family, as he himself was afterwards sensible, when he blessed God for hindering him from executing the revenge

                           and even the meanest things, should be enveloped in the general ruin. (Haydock) --- The manners of men vary, but those of
                           dogs are always the same. Hence, it is more generally supposed that this expression (Calmet) denotes that even dogs shall
                           be exterminated, and consequently other things for which Nabal would have a greater affection. (Haydock) --- Aurelian being
                           irritated against the inhabitants of Thiane, swore, "I will not leave a dog in this town;" which all people explained as if
                           he meant to leave nothing alive in it. But being afterwards moved with compassion at the distress of the people, he executed
                           his threat literally, and killed all the dogs. (Vopisc.) See 3 Kings xiv. 10., and xv. 29., and xxi. 21., and 4 Kings v. 6.
                           (Bochart, Anim. ii. 55.; Delrio, adag. 184.) (Calmet) --- The unhappy Geddes translates, "a dog," to avoid the indelicate
                           allusion. It would have been well if he had allowed himself no greater liberties! (Haydock) --- The Hebrew <I>mashtin,</I>

                           husband's incivility; and, after condemning it herself, insinuates that it would be unbecoming for a great king to mind so

                                    for according to his name, he is a fool, and folly is with him: but I, thy handmaid, did not see thy servants, my lord, whom
                                    thou sentest.</font></p>

                                    that seek evil to my lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 Wherefore receive this blessing, which thy handmaid hath brought to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 Forgive the iniquity of thy handmaid: for the Lord will surely make

                                    shall be whirled, as with the violence and whirling of a sling.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 Otherwise, <i>as </i>the Lord liveth, the God of Israel, who hath
                                    withholden me from doing thee any evil, if thou hadst not quickly come to meet me, there had not been left to Nabal by the
                                    morning light, any that pisseth against the wall.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And David received at her hand all that she had brought him, and said
                                    to her: Go in peace into thy house, behold I have heard thy voice, and&nbsp;honoured thy face.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And Abigail came to Nabal: and behold he had a feast in his house,
                                    like the feast of a king: and Nabal's heart was merry, for he was very drunk: and she told him nothing less or more until
                                    morning.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 But early in the morning, when Nabal had digested his wine, his wife
                                    told him these words, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 And after ten days had passed, the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 And when David had heard that Nabal was dead, he said: Blessed be
                                    the Lord, who hath judged the cause of my reproach, at the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil, and the Lord
                                    hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his head. Then David sent and treated with Abigail, that he might take her to himself
                                    for a wife.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 And David's servants came to Abigail, to Carmel, and spoke to her,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 And she arose, and bowed herself down with her face to the earth,
                                    and said: Behold, let thy servant be a handmaid, to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 And Abigail arose, and made haste, and got upon an ass, and five damsels
                                    went with her, her waiting maids, and she followed the messengers of David, and became his wife.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 Moreover David took also Achinoam of Jezrahel: and they were both
