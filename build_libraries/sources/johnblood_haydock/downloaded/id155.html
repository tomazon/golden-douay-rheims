                           St. Paul in this chapter endeavours to comfort the Jews, though the greatest part of them were rejected for their blindness;
                           and to admonish the Gentiles, not to boast for being called and converted, but to persevere with humility, and the fear of
                           God. --- <I>God hath not cast away his people.</I> That is, not all of them, nor hath he cast off those whom <I>he foreknew,</I>
                           and decreed to save. --- <I>The Scripture saith of Elias.</I> He brings the example of Elias living among the ten tribes of
                           Israel, when all the people were forbidden to go and adore in the temple of Jerusalem, when the altars of the true God were
                           destroyed, and almost all in these tribes were fallen into idolatry, and worshipped <I>Baal:</I> he complains as if he were
                           left alone in the worship of the true God. But <I>the divine answer</I> shewed him his mistake. <I>I have reserved to myself
                           seven thousand man,</I> &amp;c. Some take notice that <I>seven</I> is divers times put for a great number, as three and a
                           half for a small number: however, besides these seven thousand, all in the kingdom of Juda remained firm in the worship of
                           the true God. In like manner, <I>a remnant</I> is now saved by the election of grace, by God's free and liberal gift of divine
                           grace. Some pretended reformers of the faith of the Church bring this as an argument, that the Church of God may fail, and
                           fall into errors. It is sufficient to answer, that there is a wide difference betwixt the Jewish synagogue, which brought
                           nothing to perfection, and the Church of Christ, which he <I>built upon a rock,</I> with which he has promised to <I>be to
                           the end of the world,</I> and <I>guide</I> them by the <I>Spirit of Truth.</I> (Witham) --- This is very ill alleged by some
                           against the perpetual visibility of the Church of Christ: the more, because however the number of the faithful might be abridged
                           by the persecution of Jezebel in the kingdom of the ten tribes; the Church was at the same time in a most flourishing condition
                           (under Asa and Josaphat) in the kingdom of Juda. (Challoner) --- Our separated brethren add to this text, as in Acts xix.
                           35. the word <I>image.</I> They also cite it in proof of an invisible Church; but with no just grounds: for in Jerusalem the
                           faith and worship were public to the whole world. Besides, the Christian Church rests on better promises than the synagogue.
                           (Bristow) --- The Jews obtain not the justice they sought after, because they did not seek it as they ought; they expected
                           to obtain it by their works, whereas it can only be had from grace. (Estius)</FONT></P><B>

                           is not now by works: otherwise grace is no more grace.</I> The election of God, and the first grace at least, are always without
                           any merits on our part; but if we speak of works done in a state of grace, and by the assistance of God's grace, we co-operate
                           with the graces given, and by thus co-operating, we deserve and merit a reward in heaven. (Witham) --- If salvation were to
                           come by <I>works,</I> done by nature, without faith and grace, salvation would not be a grace or favour, but a debt; but such
                           <I>dead</I> works are indeed of no value in the sight of God towards salvation. It is not the same with regard to <I>works
                           done with and by </I>God's grace; for to such works as these he has promised eternal salvation. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           hath given them,</I> &amp;c. Not by his working, or acting in them; but by his permission, and by withdrawing his grace in
                           punishment of their obstinacy. (Challoner) --- Permitted them (says St. Chrysostom) to fall <I>into the spirit of insensibility.</I>
                           Literally, <I>the spirit of </I>[1] <I>compunction.</I> Compunction is not here taken, as in some spiritual writers, for a
                           great sorrow for sins. In the Latin Vulgate (Isaias vi. 9.) it is called the <I>spirit of slumber,</I> as in the Protestant
                           translation. We cannot have a better judge of the sense of the word than St. Chrysostom, who tells us, that it signifies <I>a
                           habit of the soul,</I> firmly fixed in <I>evil,</I> and an insensible disposition: as, saith he, persons under a pious compunction
                           are not to be removed from their good resolutions; so the wicked, under a hardened compunction, are nailed, as it were, to
                           vice. And that here this is the true sense, appears by the following words out of Isaias: <I>he hath given them eyes that
                           they should not see,</I> &amp;c. And also out of David, (Psalm lxviii. 23.) <I>let their table be made a snare,</I> &amp;c.
                           We may understand the spiritual food of the word of God, and of the Scriptures; which by the blindness of this people, have
                           served to their great condemnation. --- <I>And a recompense,</I> that is, for a just punishment of their obstinacy. --- <I>And
                           bow down their back always,</I> a metaphor to represent the condition of such, as are under heavy oppressions. (Witham) ---
                           Although by bending their back is literally understood the yoke of servitude and captivity, with which the Jews were oppressed
                           at the destruction of Jerusalem; yet it seems more conformable to the apostle's meaning, when considered in a spiritual sense,
                           and then it will signify the insensibility of the Jews, as to heavenly things, and their anxious solicitude for the things
                           of the earth. This their avaricious and carnal disposition was so manifest, that the poet said of them---</FONT></P>

                           rise again: but by their offending, salvation (through the liberal mercy of God) is come to the Gentiles, <I>that they,</I>
                           the Jews, may be <I>emulous</I> of the Gentiles, and of their happiness, and so may be converted. (Witham) --- The nation
                           of the Jews is not absolutely and without remedy cast off for ever; but in part only (many thousands of them having been at
                           first converted) and for a time: which fall of theirs God has been pleased to turn to the good of the Gentiles. (Challoner)
                           --- <I>How much more the fulness of them?</I> As if he should say, if the obstinacy of so many Jews seem to be an occasion
                           upon which God, whose mercy calls whom he pleaseth, hath bestowed the riches of his grace on other nations; and while the
                           glory of the Jews, the elect people of God, has been <I>diminished,</I> the Gentiles have been made happy: how much more glorious
                           <I>will be the fulness of them?</I> that is, according to the common interpretation, will be the re-establishment and conversion
                           of the Jews hereafter, before the end of the world? See St. Chrysostom,&nbsp;<I><U>om. ith</U>.</I> p. 164; St. Hilary, in
                           Ps. lviii; St. Jerome, in chap. iii. Osee. Habacuc iii.; St. Augustine, lib. xx. de Civ. Dei. chap. xxix. --- Then (ver. 15.)
                           the <I>receiving</I> of them into the Church, and their conversion to Christ, shall be like <I>life from the dead,</I> when
                           the Jewish nation in general, shall rise from the death of sin, and their hardened infidelity, to the life of faith and grace.

                           <I>If the first-fruit</I> (see the Greek word) <I>be holy, so also is the mass;</I> so also the rest, the product that follows.
                           He alludes to the offering made by the law of the first-fruit, which was to acknowledge that all good things were from God,
                           and to bring a blessing upon the rest. --- <I>If the root be holy, so are the branches.</I> By the <I>root,</I> says St. Chrysostom,
                           he understands Abraham, and the patriarchs, from whom all the Jewish nation proceeded, as branches from that root: and these
                           <I>branches</I> are to be esteemed <I>holy,</I> not only because of the root they proceeded from, but also because they worshipped
                           the true God. And if <I>some,</I> or a great part <I>of these branches,</I> have been <I>broken,</I> they may, as it is said,
                           (ver. 23.) be ingrafted again. And you, Gentiles, ought to remember that, you were of yourselves <I>a wild olive-tree:</I>
                           and it is only by the merciful call of God, that you have the happiness to <I>be ingrafted</I> upon the same root of the patriarchs;
                           and so, by imitating the faith of Abraham, are become his spiritual children, and heirs of the promises, and by that means
                           have been made partakers of <I>the root,</I> and of the sap, and <I>fatness</I> of the sweet <I>olive-tree.</I> Remember that
                           you <I>bear not the root,</I> nor were you the root that was holy; <I>but the root beareth you;</I> and that being branches
                           of a wild olive, you ought naturally still to bear bad fruit, though ingrafted on the root of a sweet olive. It is only by
                           the mercies of God, if you bring forth good fruit. Do not then be <I>high-minded,</I> nor boast, but <I>fear,</I> and endeavour
                           to <I>continue in goodness;</I> lest God also <I>spare not you,</I> but <I>cut you off,</I> as unprofitable branches. And
                           let me tell you, as to the Jews, if <I>they abide not still in unbelief,</I> God is able to ingraft them again into their
                           own olive-tree; and it seems more easy, that they, who are naturally branches of the sweet olive-tree, should bring forth
                           good fruit, when they shall be ingrafted in their own olive-tree, being of the race of Abraham, to whom the promises were
                           made. (Witham) --- We see here, that he who standeth by faith, may fall from it; and therefore must live in fear, and not
                           in the vain presumption and security of modern sectaries. (Challoner) --- The apostle here exhorts the converted Gentiles,
                           to fear lest they fall, and bring upon themselves a punishment similar to that of the Jews. The Jews were his chosen people,
                           the children of the alliance; they have now been stripped of all; the same may also happen to you. You may fall into presumption
                           and incredulity; if you remain firm, it is not by your own merits or works, but by faith, the pure gift of God. Neither faith,
                           nor vocation, nor grace, are inadmissible. You may lose all; and therefore ought always to fear and live in humility. If God
                           has not spared the natural branches, fear, lest he should not spare you. (ver. 21.) (Calmet) --- The Gentiles are here admonished
                           not to be proud, nor to glory over the Jews; but to take occasion rather from their fall to fear and to be humble, lest they
                           be cast off. Not that the whole Church of Christ can ever fall from him; having been secured by so many divine promises in
                           holy writ; but that each one in particular may fall; and therefore all in general are to be admonished to beware of that,
                           which may happen to any one in particular. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>
