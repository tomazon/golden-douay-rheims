                           Manasses: (Calmet) "the temple was trampled on," (Syriac, <i><u>egennethe eis edaphos</u></i>) and profaned. See chap. iv.

                           Paralipomenon xxxiv. 9.) and the Jews had regained their strength after the captivity of Manasses, (Calmet) having retired

                                    or who is the king over their warfare:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 And why they, above all that dwell in the east, have despised us, and

                                    and there shall not a false word come out of my mouth.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 Wherefore, forsaking the ceremonies of their fathers, which consisted

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 They worshipped one God of heaven, *who also commanded them to depart

                                    for four hundred years were so multiplied, that the army of them could not be numbered.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And when an innumerable army of the Egyptians pursued after them in

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And after they came out of the Red Sea, they abode in the deserts

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 There bitter fountains were made sweet for them to drink, and for

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And there was no one that triumphed over this people, but when they

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 But as often as, beside their own God, they worshipped any other,
                                    they were given to spoil, and to the sword, and to reproach.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And as often as they were penitent for having revolted from the worship

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 So they overthrew the king of the Chanaanites, and of the Jebusites,

                                    and they possessed their lands, and their cities:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And as long as they sinned not in the sight of their God, it was well
                                    with them: for their God hateth iniquity.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And even some years ago when they had revolted from the way which
                                    God had given them, to walk therein, they were destroyed in battles by many nations, and very many of them were led away captive
                                    into a strange land.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 But of late returning to the Lord, their God, from the different places
                                    wherein they were scattered, they are come together, and are gone up into all these mountains, and possess Jerusalem again,
                                    where their holies are.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 Now, therefore, my lord, search if there be any iniquity of theirs
                                    in the sight of their God: let us go up to them, because their God will surely deliver them to thee, and they shall be brought
