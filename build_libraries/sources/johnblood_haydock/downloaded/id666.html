                           say, Go," &amp;c., as this would obviate the harshness of the expression. (Calmet) --- However, as it is the same in the Septuagint,
                           &amp;c., and as similar words do not prove that God is the author of sin, we may explain this in the same sense, allowing
                           that he suffered the evil to take place, knowing how to draw good out of it. (St. Augustine, &amp;c.) (Haydock) --- Some take
                           this <I>Satan</I> to be an evil counsellor. (Calmet) --- The devil may be styled "the fury of God?" as he is his creature,

                           hundred thousand, and four hundred and seventy thousand fighting men:</I> though even there the Arabic version has the number
                           here specified, which is less incredible. The fighting men are not above a fifth part of the population; and we may allow
                           that David might have about seven million subjects. It seems, therefore, best to abandon the latter number as incorrect, since
                           all commentators confess that similar mistakes have been made by the transcribers; and to maintain the contrary, would be
                           indirectly to throw the blame upon the sacred writers. (Calmet) --- Yet some account for the variation, by saying, that Joab
                           gave not in the full number here, (Menochius; Abulensis; &amp;c.) which seems contrary to the text, <I>there were found,</I>
                           &amp;c. (Haydock) --- Cornelius a Lapide supposes, that the excess of number was occasioned by the subsequent list of the
                           Levites, &amp;c. But could they amount to so many? (Calmet) --- And what proof is there that they were numbered, after the
                           anger of God had manifested itself so severely? (Haydock) --- Others affirm, that Joab did not take an account of the 288,000
                           chosen out of the twelve tribes, that 24,000 of them might guard the palace by turns, in each of the twelve months, 1 Paralipomenon
                           xxvii. 1. (Bochart, Anim. p. 1. B. ii. 37.; Grotius; &amp;c.) --- But thus there will be 18,000 more than even in Paralipomenon,
                           where we find in all 1,570,000, though the tribe of Juda have fewer, by 30,000, than in this book. To account for this, some
                           say, (Haydock) the proselytes are here taken in, or the inhabitants of all the territory, which was at first assigned to Juda,
                           Josue xix. 29. (Menochius) --- All this is conjecture, (Haydock) and must remain among the systems of history. (Calmet) ---
                           If Joab chose to diminish the numbers of Israel, why has he increased those of Juda? Did he wish to flatter the king's vanity,
                           or partiality for his own tribe? It is difficult to say what interest Joab could have in withholding the truth; and for the
                           sacred historian to countenance his delusion, would expose us to the same danger of mistake, and overthrow the authority of
                           Scripture, <FONT size=3>no less than if the author had been liable to error, and uninspired. It seems, therefore</FONT>, most
                           rational to suppose that we have here the true list of the warriors, and that the book of Paralipomenon has been injured by
                           the negligence of transcribers, as it has on many other occasions. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           heart struck him, after the people were numbered.</I> That is, he was touched with a great remorse for the vanity and pride
                           which had put him upon numbering the people. (Challoner) --- His sin must have been internal, and probably involved a secret
                           confidence in his riches and power, without referring all to God, (Haydock) or trusting entirely in him. (St. Ambrose, p&#339;n.
                           c. 9.; St. Augustine, contra Faust. xxii. 66., &amp;c.) --- There was otherwise no prohibition for David's taking this account,
                           (Calmet) which is so natural for a prince, and may frequently prove of great service. (Haydock) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?]
                           vii. 13.) and others assert, that he neglected to require the payment of half a sicle. (Tirinus; Estius) --- But where does
                           God complain of this neglect? and how do they know that the injunction which was once given to Moses, when the tabernacle
                           was to be furnished, (Exodus xxx. 12.) was to remain in force afterwards? Oleaster (on Exodus) says David acted against God's
                           intention, who had promised that the Israelites should be innumerable. But this reason seems childish; and did not the king
                           abstain, on that very account, from numbering any but those who were fit for war? (1 Paralipomenon xxvii. 23.) (Calmet) ---

                           Paralipomenon, <I>three;</I> which makes the contrast more striking. (Haydock) --- The Septuagint, and some copies of the
                           Arabic version, have the latter number. (Calmet) --- Gad might first propose seven, and then reduce it to three. (Menochius)
                           --- But did the prophet deliver the message twice? Usher pleads for the truth of both numbers, though he says, "It was always
                           my opinion, that the Hebrew copy of the Old Testament has been no less exposed to the errors of writers, than that of the
                           New, and all other books." (Synt. p. 219.) Boxtorf also declares, "it is better piously to believe that both is right." Why?
                           "because both is written." (Antic. p. 401 and 420!) The contradiction, in fact, seems to have been occasioned by the mistake
                           of a numeral letter, <I>g</I> (3) for <I>z</I> (7). (Kennicott) --- Usher, Malvenda, &amp;c., adopt an hypothesis, beautiful
                           enough, but destitute of proof, when they say that God proposed three years in <I>punishment</I> of David's criminal curiosity.
                           But as that famine would have immediately followed the three years' scarcity, already endured, (chap. xxi.) and during the
                           seventh, or sabbatical year, nothing could be reaped, the famine would thus rage for seven years. (Calmet) Salien places the
                           62nd sabbatical year at this very time, the year of the world 3017, and terminates the famine occasioned by the cruel injustice
                           of Saul, the year before Christ 1013, which cannot agree with the aforesaid system. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           the temporal punishment due to sin. (Haydock) --- God punishes us equally by the hand of men, as by other means; but the king
                           thus intimates, that he looks upon Him as an indulgent father, who is less severe than the ministers of justice. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>
