                                    covered him with a garment, that they who passed might not stop on his account.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And Joab answering, said: God forbid, God forbid that I should; I

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 The matter is not so; but a man of Mount Ephraim, Seba, the son of
