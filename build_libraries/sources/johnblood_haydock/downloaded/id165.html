                           judgment is in the day, or time of this life: but God judges in his day, after this life, and chiefly at the last day of judgment.
                           --- <I>Neither do I judge myself,</I> so as to look upon myself absolutely certain of the state of my soul, or that I am for
                           certain justified, though <I>I am not conscious to myself of any thing,</I> because I am to be judged by an omniscient God,
                           the great searcher of hearts, who perhaps may discover faults, which I, partial to myself, overlook. Now if St. Paul durst
                           not say, he was justified, what presumption is it for others to pretend to an absolute certainty, that they are just in the
                           sight of God! (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           is justified by believing himself so. (Estius) --- If this privileged apostle was afraid to from any judgment of his own heart
                           and thoughts, whether they were pure or not, but left the trial thereof to the day of judgment, the day of his death, how

                           whether I, or Apollo, or Cephas were the best preachers, without naming those, as I might do, who are the true causes of these
                           divisions, by striving who should be thought men of the greatest and brightest parts. --- <I>That in us,</I> and by our example,
                           who have no such proud disputes, <I>you might learn that one be not puffed up against the other,</I> and <I>above that which
                           is written,</I> against the admonitions given in the holy Scriptures of being humble: or against what I have now written to
                           you, that we must strive for nothing, but to be the <I>faithful</I> ministers of God, and not seek the esteem of men. (Witham)
                           --- It is the opinion of St. Thomas Aquinas and likewise of Estius, that St. Paul, Apollo, and Cephas were not the real causes
                           of the divisions that existed amongst the new converts at Corinth, but that in making use of these names, he wished to teach
                           them, that if it was unlawful to keep up these divisions even for the sake of the apostles, how far should they be from doing
                           any thing of this kind for those whose authority was much less in the Church. But Calmet is of opinion, that the divisions
                           amongst the Corinthians were certainly on account of Paul, Apollo, Cephas, and perhaps some others, whose names are not mentioned.</FONT></P><B>

                           the author of every gift and perfection? This is not only true of the gift of preaching, but of all gifts and graces; so that
                           St. Augustine makes use of it in several places against the Pelagians, to shew that it is by grace only, that one man is preferred
                           before another, and not by, or for his own merits. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.</I> I wish your reigning and governing the people were well grounded
                           on virtue and truth, that we might be sharers of the like happiness. St. Chrysostom takes notice, that St. Paul speaks thus,
                           meaning the contrary, by the figure called <I>irony:</I> and so also St. Chrysostom understands the two following verses,
                           as if St. Paul only represented what those vain preachers said with contempt of him, as if he were only an apostle of an inferior
                           rank, not one of the chief, nor of the twelve. And when he says, <EM>we are fools for Christ's </EM><SPAN lang=EN><EM>sake,
                           but you are wise:</EM> it is certain the apostles were not <EM>fools,</EM> nor these preachers </SPAN>whom he blames, <I>wise,</I>
                           especially in Christ. But though the apostle partly use this figure of irony, intermixing it in his discourse, yet he also
                           represents the condition of all true apostles, and preachers of Christ crucified, whose persons and doctrine were slighted,
                           ridiculed, and laughed at by men that were wise only with worldly wisdom, especially by profane libertines, and atheistical
                           men, that make a jest of all revealed religion. To go about preaching in <I>hunger,</I> in <I>thirst,</I> in <I>nakedness,</I>
                           in <I>want,</I> under afflictions and persecutions, is what they think is to be miserable: they despise such men as the <I>out-cast,</I>
                           the <I>dross,</I>[1] and the <I>dregs</I> of mankind. (See the Greek text.) (Witham) --- He speaks to the Corinthians, who
                           forgetting their first fervour, and the Christian modesty which St. Paul had taught them, both by word and example, were endeavouring
                           to distinguish themselves by the reputation and honour of the apostle, who had converted them, by their antiquity of faith,
                           and by other things more frivolous. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Theod. [Theodoret?], and many others think, that the apostle is here speaking of the good angels, who behold with pleasure
                           the labours and afflictions of the saints, knowing that it will prove a source of glory; but Estius, Vat. [Vatable?], and
                           some others, are of opinion, that the wicked angels are here spoken of, who rejoice at the persecutions of God's servants,

                           did not go to Corinth till one or two years after this letter was written. He wrote his second epistle to the same before
                           he paid them a visit, to apply a soothing remedy to their minds and hearts, sorely afflicted with his charitably severe corrections
