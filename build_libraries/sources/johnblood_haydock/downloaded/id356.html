                           i. 196, that the Babylonians sold their beautiful women as high as possible, and gave part of the price to help off the more
                           deformed. The Turks do the like. (Calmet) --- <i>A few,</i> &amp;c. So highly did he esteem Rachel, that he thought he had
                           obtained her for just nothing, though delays naturally seem long to lovers. (Tirinus) --- Calmet supposes that he was married
                           to her the second month after he arrived at Haran; and on this account, easily explains his words, as love made all labour
                           tolerable, and even easy, in the enjoyment of the beautiful Rachel. Usher also places the birth of Ruben in the first year
                           of Jacob's service, A. 2246[the year of the world 2246]. But Salien and the context decide, that he waited full seven years,
                           and then obtained Lia, by fraud, of Laban; and seven days after, Rachel. (Haydock) --- He was then 84 years old! (Du Hamel)</font></p><b>

                           inasmuch as she obeyed his order. (Menochius) --- Jacob might justly have refused to marry her; and then what a dishonour
                           would have been entailed upon her for life! In consequence of this imposition, the legitimacy of Ruben's conception was rendered
                           doubtful. We may suppose, that shame hindered Lia from opening her mouth; so that Jacob had no means of discovering the cheat
                           till day-break, having gone into the nuptial chamber after it was dark, according to custom, and the woman being also covered
                           with a veil, Tobias viii. 1. Hence Jacob was guilty of no fault, as his mistake was involuntary. (Haydock) --- He afterwards
