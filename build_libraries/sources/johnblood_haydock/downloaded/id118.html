                           the temple.</I> Though the Jewish ceremonies were shortly to cease, yet it was not unlawful to follow them; and they went
                           to the temple as a proper place for prayer. (Witham) --- <I>The ninth hour,</I> that is, about three in the afternoon. But
                           we must here observe, that the Hebrews divided the light into twelve hours, and the dark into twelve hours; so that their
                           hours would be of unequal length: longer in summer, shorter in winter. (Menochius) --- The custom of praying three times in
                           the day, is ancient among the Jews. Daniel at Babylon opened his window on the side which looked towards the temple of Jerusalem,
                           and three times a day bent his knees before the Lord. The ancient Fathers of the Church have strongly recommended this established
                           custom of praying three times in the day, morning, noon, and evening. It is indeed not a precept, but a religious observation,
                           to which she invites all her children. See St. Clement of Alexandria, Constit. lib. vii. chap. 24.; Tertullian, de Jejuniis,
                           &amp;c. --- In Catholic countries, the toll of a bell at morning, noon, and evening, announces the time for the recital of
                           the <I>Angelus Domini,</I> a short prayer, in honour of the incarnation. At these moments, all, however employed, whether
                           at labour in the field, or at home, all cease from their employment, till they have recited the prayer. The repetition of
                           this, and similar practices, cannot be too strongly recommended to Catholics of the present day. They are of singular advantage
                           in recalling the soul, which is too easily dissipated and distracted, to God, her first beginning, and her last end. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           what I have, I give thee.</I> Though St. Luke told us, (chap. ii. 43.) that the apostles did <I>many miracles and prodigies,</I>
                           yet this is the first specified. <I>In the name of Jesus of Nazareth,</I> (known by that name, though of Bethlehem) <I>arise,
                           and walk.</I> In the name of Jesus, lately nailed to a cross. (Witham) --- This is not the shadow of a great name, <I>magni
                           nominis umbra,</I> but the truth of what it signifies, <I>a Saviour.</I> Not without reason is this name in the Canticles
                           compared to oil, in its three-fold properties, of affording light, food, and medicine. When preached, it enlightens; thought
                           on, it feeds us; and called on, it assuages our grief. Whence has such a sudden light of faith spread over the world, but
                           in preaching the name of Jesus? How did this light shine, and attract the eyes of all, when proceeding like lightning from
                           the mouth of Peter, it strengthened the weakness of the lame man's feet, and enlightened the minds of many spiritually blind?
                           Did he not then scatter fire, when he exclaimed, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, arise and walk? This name is food too.
                           Are you not refreshed, as often as you recall it to your mind? What is as powerful in consoling the mind? What so soon repairs
                           our wearied senses, and gives new vigour to our strength; encourages virtues, cherishes chaste affections? All food is dry
                           to me, if not seasoned with this oil; insipid, unless sprinkled with this salt. If you write, I relish it not, unless I read
                           the name of Jesus. If your read, or speak, I take no pleasure in it, unless I hear the name of Jesus. Jesus is honey in the
                           mouth, music to the ear, but ecstasy to the heart. This is also my medicine. Are you sad? let Jesus enter your heart, and
                           thence ascend upon your tongue. And behold, at the rising of this star, every cloud will retire, and serenity return. Do you
                           fall into a crime, or run on the brink of despair: call on this name of life, and you shall be restored to life, &amp;c. (St.

                           Jesus remains in heaven, till his second coming to judge the living and the dead. That is the great day, when every thing
                           shall be finally settled, and restored to its proper order. He shall avenge the injuries done to God; restore peace to the
                           afflicted just men of the earth, and justice to their persecutors. He shall exalt his Church, and himself receive the homage
                           of adoration, from every tribe of men. (Calmet) --- See 2 Peter iii. 13. which text, together with what we read in this place,
                           joins inseparably the last coming of Jesus Christ, with the universal re-establishment promised in both these passages, and
                           completely excludes the <I>Millennium,</I> which some erroneously expect to take place between the accomplishment of the first
                           and second of these events. See Bossuet's reflexions on the 20th chapter of the Apocalypse, where the errors of many Protestant
                           writers, especially of Dodwell, are refuted. To shew that the error of the Millennium cannot be assigned as a general cause
                           which impelled the primitive Christians to martyrdom, it will suffice to produce this decisive passage of St. Justin, who
                           after Papias, was the first supporter of that system: speaking to Tryphon concerning this temporal kingdom, which Christ was
                           to enjoy here below, in the re-established Jerusalem with the saints risen from the dead, for a thousand years, he says: "I
                           have already confessed that many others, with myself, were of this opinion; ... but there are many others, and persons of
                           sound faith, and exemplary conduct, who reject this opinion." (In dialog. cum Tryph. n. 84.) --- Clement of Alexandria, St.
                           Cyprian, and Origen, lay down principles diametrically opposite to this system. It has also been expressly combated by Caius,
                           and St. Denis of Alexandria, one of the greatest luminaries of the third century, as we learn from Eusebius, and St. Jerome.</FONT></P><B>

                           was punishable with death, how much more severe will be the punishment of those, who refuse obedience to the doctrines of
                           Jesus, to whom all the prophets bore testimony, and whom the apostles then preached. How different is this system of submission
                           to the teaching of the prophets, and apostles, from that libertinism, which undermines the whole fabric of religion, by taking
                           away from the Church the power of commanding, and from the disciple the necessity of obeying. By what wonderful and progressive
                           shades of light was the prediction of this great prophet made to man! From the fall of Adam, it was predicted, that the seed
                           of the woman would crush the serpent's head. Many ages after, God manifested that from Abraham's loins the Redeemer should
                           spring, "in whom all nations should be blessed." The promise is renewed to Isaac, and that he is to spring from his son, but
                           not from Esau, but from Jacob; and of the twelve sons of Jacob, the posterity of Juda is to have the privilege of bestowing
                           a Messias to the world, and the token of its accomplishment is, "the failure of the sceptre in the posterity of Juda." After
                           a long series of events, and of ages, an humble shepherd is chosen in the tribe of Juda: he is led to the throne; and to this
                           man, David, it is repeated, that from him the Messias shall spring, and that his kingdom shall have no end. The oracle is
                           so explicit in the psalms of that king, and in the writings of successive prophets, that it not only expresses the race, the
                           tribe, the family, but also the character of the mother, the place of his birth, the precise period of the event, the ministry,
                           the power, the dignity, the circumstances of his death, the change of the covenant, and conversion of the world. The particular
                           prophecies, in their accomplishment, were a visible earnest to the Jews of the accomplishment of the prophecies relative to
                           the Messias. Hence Pascal very justly remarks: "The prophets mingle particular prophecies with those of the Messias; that
                           the prophecies regarding the Messias may not be without proof, and that the particular prophecies may not be without effect."
                           (<SPAN lang=EN>Pensées</SPAN>. xv.) --- These oracles, which during a period of four thousand years, have been delivered to
                           the world, and which have been completely and visibly fulfilled, still exist in books, scrupulously preserved by the greatest
                           enemies of Christ, and of his holy religion, and satisfactorily demonstrate Jesus Christ to be the great prophet, and the
                           Christian religion to be the new covenant, which had been announced so many ages before, in so many different manners.</FONT></P><B>
