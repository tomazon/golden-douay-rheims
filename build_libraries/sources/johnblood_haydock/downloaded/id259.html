                           a servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ.</I> Some have doubted whether the author of this epistle was St. James, the
                           apostle, because he does not call himself an apostle. By the same weak argument we might reject all the three epistles of
                           St. John and his Apocalypse, and the epistle of St. Jude. Nor does St. Paul give himself this title in those to the Thessalonians,
                           to the Philippians, to Philemon, or to the Hebrews. --- <I>To the twelve tribes, which are dispersed.</I> Literally, <I>which
                           are in the dispersion.</I> That is, to the Jews converted in all nations. --- <I>Greetings.</I>[1] Literally, <I>salvation.</I>
                           Which comprehendeth much the same as, when St. Paul says, <I>grace, peace, mercy,</I> &amp;c. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           worketh a trial.</I> They are easily reconciled. Here St. James teacheth us, that patience is occasionally obtained, and strengthened
                           by sufferings, the meaning of St. Paul is, that patience worketh, sheweth itself, and is found perfect in the sight of God

                           of sin, which God cannot do. The Greek may also signify, he neither can be tempted, nor tempt any one. But every one is thus
                           tempted by the evil desires of his corrupt nature, which is called <I>concupiscence,</I> and which is not properly called
                           a sin of itself, but only when we yield to it. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>
                           <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">Ver. 15.</FONT></B><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif"> <I>When

                           become sinful, and <I>when</I> any grievous <I>sin is completed,</I> or even consented to, it <I>begetteth death,</I> it maketh
                           the soul guilty of eternal death. It may not be amiss here to observe with St. Gregory, &amp;c. that there are three degrees
                           in temptations: the <STRONG>first</STRONG>, by <I>suggestion only;</I> the second, by <I>delectation;</I> the third, by <I>consent.</I>
                           The first, the devil, or our own frail nature, tempts us by a suggestion of evil thoughts in our <I>imagination:</I> to have
                           such thoughts and imaginations may be no sin at all, though the things and objects represented be never so foul and hideous,
                           though they may continue never so long, and return never so often. The reason is, because we cannot hinder them. On the contrary,
                           if our will remains displeased with them, and resist them, such a resistance is meritorious, and by the mercies of God will
                           purchase us a reward. <STRONG>Second</STRONG>, these representations may be followed with a delight or delectation in the
                           senses, or in the body only; and if by an impression made against the will, which we no ways consent to, there is again no
                           sin. There may be also some neglect in the person tempted, by not using sufficient endeavours to resist and repel those thoughts,
                           which if it be only some small neglect, the sin is not great: but if the person tempted hath wilfully, and with full deliberation,
                           taken delight in evil thoughts, either of revenge, or of fornication, or adultery, or about any thing very sinful, such a
                           <I>wilful delight</I> is a grievous and deadly sin, though he hath not had a will or design to perform the action itself.
                           The reason is, because he then wilfully consents in mind and heart to a sinful delight, though not to the execution or action.
                           And the sin may be great, and mortal, though it be but for a short time: for a temptation may continue for a long time and
                           be no sin; and there may be a great sin in a short time. The reason again is, because we are to judge of sin by the dispositions
                           and consent of the will, not by the length of time. <STRONG>Third</STRONG>, when the sinner yields to evil suggestions and
                           temptations, so that his will fully consents to what is proposed, and nothing can be said to be wanting but an opportunity
                           of putting his sinful desires in execution, he has already committed the sin; for example, of murder, of fornication, &amp;c.
                           in his heart, as our blessed Saviour taught us. (Matthew v. 28.) (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           unless it be through a zeal for God's honour, and against sin. (Witham) --- St. James in this epistle does not aim at a regular
                           discourse: he proposes a diversity of moral sentences, which have not much connection with each other. He here instructs the
                           faithful how to behave in conversation. He recommends to them modesty and prudence in their discourses; and rather to be fond
                           of hearing much, than of speaking much; and of practising the truth, than of preaching it to others. "For not those who understand
                           the law, nor those who preach it, are justified before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified before God." (Romans
                           chap. ii. 13.) (Calmet) --- A wise man is known by the fewness of his words. Sapiens verbis innotescit paucis. (Rule of St.
                           Benedict, chap. vii.) With hearing, the wise man will become wiser. (Sen. [Seneca?] lib. ii. de <SPAN lang=EN>Irâ</SPAN>.
                           chap. 28.) --- Anger is a short madness. The best cure is to permit it to subside, and to let our reason have time to reflect
                           upon the propriety of doing what we are at first inclined to. The first motions to anger are frequently indeliberate, and
                           consequently not sinful; but we must be careful to resist as soon as we perceive them, lest they should become too violent,
                           and obtain the consent of our will. (Calmet) --- Learn of me, says our Saviour, because I am meek and humble of heart. (Matthew
                           chap. xii. 29.) If, says St. Francis de Sales, being stung and bit by detractors and enemies, we fly out, swell, and are enraged,
                           it is a great sign that neither our humility nor meekness are true and sincere, but only apparent and artificial. It is better,
                           says St. Augustine, writing to Profuturus, to deny entrance to just and reasonable anger, than to admit it, be it ever so
                           little; because, being once admitted, it is with difficulty driven out again; for it enters as a little twig, and in a moment
                           becomes a beam: and if it can once but get the night of us, and the sun set upon it, which the apostle forbids, it turns into
                           a hatred, from which we have scarcely any means to rid ourselves; for it nourishes itself under a thousand false pretexts,
                           since there was never an angry man that thought his anger unjust. (St. Francis de Sales, Introduction to a devout life, p.

                           troop of our companions and brethren meekly, peaceably, and lovingly; nay, I say to you absolutely and without exception,
                           be not angry at all, if it be possible, and admit no pretext whatsoever to open the gate of your heart to so destructive a
                           passion: for St. James here tells us positively, and without reservation, "the anger of man works not the justice of God."
                           (St. Francis de Sales, Introduction to a devout life, p. 3. chap. viii.) --- The patient man is better than the valiant; and
                           he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh cities. (Proverbs chap. xvi. 32.) The anger of man is the daughter of pride,
                           the mother of enmities, he enemy of peace and harmony, and the source of stubbornness and blindness of mind and heart. The
                           justice of God is humility, meekness, charity, peace, docility, and forbearance. How great the contrast!</FONT></P><B>
