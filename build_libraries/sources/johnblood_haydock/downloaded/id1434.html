                           <i>So.</i> Greek, "If in a frugal and middling style, this is as well as I was able." (Haydock) --- <i>Perfectly.</i> This
                           is not said with regard to the truth of the narration, but with regard to the style and manner of writing, which in the sacred
                           penmen is not always the most accurate. See St. Paul, 2 Corinthians xi. 6. (Challoner) --- The style was frequently left to
                           their choice. (Haydock) --- Inspiration did not exclude natural acquirements. (Calmet) --- The author is not afraid of having
                           said any thing erroneous, though he might be less polished, like St. Paul: <i>imperitus sermone sed non scientia.</i> But
                           we, having now come to the end of the Old Testament, must crave pardon for any mistakes into which we may have fallen, in
                           the execution of this work, which is dedicated to the English (Worthington) and to all his majesty's Catholic subjects, for
                           whose benefit chiefly and for the sake of religion it has been undertaken. The <i>many things hard to be understood,</i> [2
                           Peter iii. 16.] which we did not wish to pass over, have swelled this work to a larger volume than was at first intended;
                           larger, perhaps, than the purses of the poor and middle ranks, in the late hard times, could bear. But now the prospect is
                           more cheering; and it is hoped that this profusion on a subject of such vast importance will be pardoned, particularly as
                           we had also to comply with the desires of the more affluent, who repeatedly requested that the notes might be rather "more
                           ample." <i>As they that prepare a feast, and seek to satisfy the will of others,</i> so we, <i>for the sake of many, willingly
                           undergo the labour,</i> chap. ii. 28. The variety of matter and of style may well be compared to a mixture of <i>wine</i>
                           and <i>water,</i> ver. 40. Yet our aim has not been merely to please, but rather to counteract the baneful influences of heresy
                           and infidelity. Thomas Paine (Age of Reason, part 2nd) having touched upon a few difficulties in some of the books of Scripture,
                           says exultingly: "I have gone through the Bible as a man would go through a wood, with an axe on his shoulders, and fell trees;
                           here they lie, and the priests, if they can, may replant them. They may perhaps stick them in the ground, but they will never
                           grow." Yes, they will grow, and brave the fury of tempests, because they have been planted not by priest, but by the hand
                           of God. The Scriptures and the Church will stand and support each other till time shall be no more. The true faith has been
                           preserved from Adam through all succeeding generations, and antichrist himself will not be able to destroy it. <i>My WORD
                           shall not pass away,</i> [Mark xiii. 31.] says our divine Master. As we have repeatedly proved this assertion in the foregoing
                           notes, which are already perhaps too copious, we shall refer the more inquisitive reader to the remarks of Dr. Worthington
                           on the six ages, in the Douay Bible.</font></p><b>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">1 But *when Nicanor understood that Judas was in the places of Samaria,
                                    he purposed to set upon him with all violence, on the sabbath day.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 And when the Jews that were constrained to follow him, said: Do not
                                    act so fiercely and barbarously, but give honour to the day that is sanctified: and reverence him that beholdeth all things:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 That unhappy man asked, if there were a mighty One in heaven, that
                                    had commanded the sabbath day to be kept.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 And when they answered: There is the living Lord himself in heaven,
                                    the mighty One, that commanded the seventh day to be kept.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 Then he said: And I am mighty upon the earth, and I command to take
                                    arms, and to do the king's business. Nevertheless he prevailed not to accomplish his design.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 So Nicanor being puffed up with exceeding great pride, thought to set
                                    up a public monument of his victory over Judas.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 But Machabeus ever trusted with all hope that God would help them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And he exhorted his people not to fear the coming of the nations, but
                                    to remember the help they had before received from heaven, and now to hope for victory from the Almighty.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And speaking to them out of the law, and the prophets, and withal putting
                                    them in mind of the battles they had fought before, he made them more cheerful:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 Then after he had encouraged them, he shewed withal the falsehood
                                    of the Gentiles, and their breach of oaths.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 So he armed every one of them, not with defence of shield and spear,
                                    but with very good speeches and exhortations, and told them a dream worthy to be believed, whereby he rejoiced them all.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 Now the vision was in this manner: Onias, who had been high priest,
                                    a good and virtuous man, modest in his looks, gentle in his manners, and graceful in&nbsp;speech, and who from a child was
                                    exercised in virtues, holding up his hands, prayed for all the people of the Jews:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 After this there appeared also another man, admirable for age, and
                                    glory, and environed with great beauty and majesty:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 Then Onias answering, said: This is a lover of his brethren, and of
                                    the people of Israel: this is he that prayeth much for the people, and for all the holy city, Jeremias, the prophet of God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Whereupon Jeremias stretched forth his right hand, and gave to Judas
                                    a sword of gold, saying:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 Take this holy sword, a gift from God, wherewith thou shalt overthrow
                                    the adversaries of my people, Israel.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Thus being exhorted with the words of Judas, which were very good,
                                    and proper to stir up the courage, and strengthen the hearts of the young men, they resolved to fight, and to set upon them
                                    manfully: that valour might decide the matter, because the holy city, and the temple were in danger.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 For their concern was less for their wives, and children, and for
                                    their brethren, and kinsfolks: but their greatest and principal fear was for the holiness of the temple.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And they also that were in the city, had no little concern for them
                                    that were to be engaged in battle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And now when all expected what judgment would be given, and the enemies
                                    were at hand, and the army was set in array, the beasts and the horsemen ranged in convenient places,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 Machabeus considering the coming of the multitude, and the divers
                                    preparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts, stretching out his hands to heaven, called upon the Lord, that worketh
                                    wonders, who giveth victory to them that are worthy, not according to the power of their arms, but according as it seemeth
                                    good to him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And in his prayer he said after this manner: *Thou, O Lord, who didst
                                    send thy angel in the time of Ezechias, king of Juda, and didst kill a hundred and eighty-five thousand of the army of Sennacherib:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Send now also, O Lord of heaven, thy good angel before us, for the
                                    fear and dread of the greatness of thy arm,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 That they may be afraid, who come with blasphemy against thy holy
                                    people. And thus he concluded his prayer.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 But Nicanor, and they that were with him came forward, with trumpets
                                    and songs.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 But Judas, and they that were with him, encountered them, calling
                                    upon God by prayers:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 So fighting with their hands, but praying to the Lord with their hearts,
                                    they slew no less than five and thirty thousand, being greatly cheered with the presence of God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And when the battle was over, and they were returning with joy, they
                                    understood that Nicanor was slain in his armour.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 Then making a shout, and a great noise, they blessed the Almighty
                                    Lord in their own language.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And Judas, who was altogether ready, in body and mind, to die for
                                    his countrymen, commanded that Nicanor's head, and his hand, with the shoulder, should be cut off, and carried to Jerusalem.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 And when he was come thither, having called together his countrymen,
                                    and the priests to the altar, he sent also for them that were in the castle,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 And shewing them the head of Nicanor, and the wicked hand, which he
                                    had stretched out, with proud boasts, against the holy house of the Almighty God,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 He commanded also, that the tongue of the wicked Nicanor, should be
                                    cut out and given by pieces to birds, and the hand of the furious man to be hanged up over-against the temple.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 Then all blessed the Lord of heaven, saying: Blessed be he that hath
                                    kept his own place undefiled.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And he hung up Nicanor's head in the top of the castle, that it might
                                    be an evident and manifest sign of the help of God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And they all ordained by a common decree, by no means to let this
                                    day pass without solemnity:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 But to celebrate the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, called in

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 So these things being done with relation to Nicanor, and from that

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 For as it is hurtful to drink always wine, or always water, but pleasant
