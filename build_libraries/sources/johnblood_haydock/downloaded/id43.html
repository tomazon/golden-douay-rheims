                           Church; by <i>oil,</i> grace and charity. (Witham) --- The kingdom of heaven is not unfrequently compared to the Church militant;
                           which, as it is composed of both just and wicked, reprobate and elect, is deservedly compared to five wise and five foolish
                           virgins: the wise constantly aspiring after their blessed country; the foolish, with all their fasts and austerities, wishing
                           to procure nothing more than the empty esteem of men. (St. Gregory) --- <i>Went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride;</i>
                           in the Greek, it is simply, <i>before the bridegroom.</i> The custom among the Jews was, that the bridegroom should go to
                           fetch his spouse, and conduct her with solemnity to his house. (Bible de Vence) --- This was the conclusive ceremony, and
                           done in the night-time. The young women of the vicinity, in order to do her honour, went to meet her with lighted lamps. Modern
                           travellers inform us, that this custom still obtains with the eastern nations, particularly the Persians. Hence the Latin
                           phrase, <em>ducere uxorem</em>, to marry.</font></p><b>

                           <i>But the wise took oil.</i> Under this parable, we have the state of all Christians in their mortal pilgrimage justly delineated.
                           The wise took oil in their lamps, the necessary qualifications of grace and charity, joined with divine faith, and an additional
                           supply of oil in their vessels; i.e. they laid up in store for themselves a solid foundation of good works. St. Gregory teaches,
                           that by the <i>lamps,</i> faith is meant; and by the <i>light,</i> good works. Hence he concludes that the bad, although they
                           have lamps, i.e. faith, no less than the good, shall be excluded; because their lamps are out, i.e. their faith is dead, without
                           charity and good works to enlighten them. (hom. xii.) --- St. Augustine also declares, that these lighted lamps are good works,
                           viz. works of mercy and good conversation, which shine forth before men. (ep. 120. chap. xxxiii.) --- And, that this oil is
                           a right inward intention, directing all our works to the greater glory of God, and not to the praise of ourselves in the sight
                           of men. (Idem. <i>ibid. </i>[St. Augustine, ep. 120. chap. xxxiii.]) --- The foolish virgins had a little oil in their lamps
                           at first, sufficient to shine before men, by some little external shew of piety, or certain works done through fear, profit,
                           or human respects; but had made no <font size="3">provision of oil in their vessels, i.e. in their hearts and conscience,
                           no provision </font>of solid piety and charity, by means of which they might, like the prudent virgins, produce good works
                           to salvation. (Jansenius)</font></p><b>

                           <i>they all slumbered and slept;</i> viz. they all died. Hence St. Paul, <i>nolo vos ignorare de dormientibus.</i> But the
                           reason why Jesus Christ says they slumbered is, because they were to rise again: and by the expression, <i>whilst the bridegroom
                           tarried,</i> Christ wishes to shew us that a very short time will elapse between his first and second coming. (St. Jerome)</font></p><b>

                           the wise virgins, who having their oil ready, and their lamps trimmed and burning, soon prepare themselves to give in their
                           accounts to their Lord; or, like the foolish, who having made no provision of the oil of good works, are compelled to seek
                           it at the time they are to be judged. (St. Augustine) --- It is said he will come at midnight; i.e. when least expected.</font></p><b>

                           negligent in preparing themselves by good works for the coming of the bridegroom. But when they perceived themselves called
                           away from this life, to go and meet their judge, they then begin to find their lamps extinguished, and to think of procuring
                           for themselves the oil of good works, by bequeathing their effects to the poor. Though we ought not to despair of the salvation
                           of these, still there is great room to fear; for, a death-bed repentance is seldom sincere, more seldom, or never perfect,
                           and always uncertain. (Jansenius)</font></p><b>

                           therefore are answered by the wise: "go now to those to whom you have given all your actions; go and see what their praises
                           will avail, what peace of conscience they can give you: and, if they have praised you, and made you esteemed in the eyes of
                           men, see if they can do the same before God." (St. Augustine)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Watch ye.</i> St. Augustine asks, how can we be always watching, it being necessary for each one to give himself sufficient
                           time to sleep and rest from his many labours? He answers the question in these words: We may always keep watching to our hearts
                           by faith, hope, charity, and all other good works. But when we awake, like the five wise virgins, we must arise and trim our
                           lamps, by supplying them with the oil of good works. Then they will not go out, nor will the soothing oil of a good conscience
                           be wanting to us. Then will the bridegroom come and introduce us to his house, where we shall never need sleep or rest; nor
                           will our lamps ever be in danger of going out. Whilst we are in this life, we labour; and our lamps, blown about by the winds
                           of innumerable temptations, are always in danger of being extinguished; but soon their flame shall become more brilliant,
                           and the temptations we have suffered here shall not diminish, but increase its lustre. (St. Augustine, serm. xxiv.)</font></p><b>

                           But that the apostles and all men might learn how they ought to watch, and to prepare for the last day, he subjoins another
                           instructive parable of the ten talents. It has a great affinity with that mentioned in St. Luke, xix. 11. But this last was
                           spoken at a different time, place, and occasion. It differs also in some points. --- <i>For even as a man,</i> &amp;c. This
                           passage is to be understood of our divine Redeemer, who ascended to heaven encompassed by his human nature. The proper abode
                           for the flesh is the earth; when, therefore, it is placed in the kingdom of God, it may be said to be gone into a far country.
                           (St. Gregory) --- But when we speak of his divine nature, we cannot say that he is gone into a far country, but only when
                           we speak of his humanity. (Origen)</font></p><b>

                           In the parable of the talents, the master is God, talents, graces, &amp;c. (Witham) --- From this, it appears, we can do no
                           good of ourselves, but only by means of God's grace, though he requires our co-operation; since the servants could only make
                           use of the talents given them to gain others. (A talent is £187 10s.) It is also worthy of remark, that both he who received
                           five and he who received only two talents, received an equal reward of entering into the joy of our Lord; which shews, that
                           only an account will be taken according to what we have received, and that however mean and despicable our abilities may be,
                           we still have an equal facility with the most learned of entering heaven. (Jansenius) --- The servant to whom this treasure
                           was delivered, is allegorically explained of the faithful adorers of God, in the Jewish law, who departing from it, became
                           followers of Christ, and therefore deserving of a double recompense. ... The servant to whom the two talents were delivered,
                           is understood of the Gentiles, who were justified in the faith and confession of the Father and the Son, and confessed our
                           Lord Jesus Christ, God and man, composed of body and soul; and as the people of the Jews doubled the five talents they received,
                           so the Gentiles, by the duplication of their two talents, merited a double recompense also. ... But the servant who received
                           only one talent, and hid it in the ground, represented such of the Jews as persisted in the observation of the old law, and
                           thus kept their talent buried in the ground, for fear the Gentiles should be converted. (St. Hilary)</font></p><b>

                           <i>He that had received the one.</i> The man who hid this one talent, represents all those who, having received any good quality,
                           whether mental or corporal, employ it only on earthly things. (St. Gregory) --- Origen is also of the same sentiment: if you

                           having omitted to perform good works. (Witham) --- St. Augustine, in his 33d sermon, brings a beautiful reason why the kingdom
                           of heaven is bestowed solely upon the works of mercy, and eternal damnation for the neglect of them; viz. because, however
                           just a man may be, still he has many failings to atone for, on account of which the kingdom of heaven might be justly denied
                           him: but because he has shewn mercy to his neighbours, he deserves in like manner to have mercy shewn him. But the wicked,
                           not having shewn mercy to their neighbours, nor redeemed their sins by alms-deeds, or the like, are thus delivered up to eternal
                           damnation. (Jansenius, concord.) --- Jesus Christ only mentions one species of good works, though others may be equally meritorious;
                           for the means of salvation are not precisely the same for all the saints; some are saved by poverty, others by solitude, and
                           each by that virtue which he shall have practised in the greatest degree of perfection.</font></p><b>

                           alms-deeds, as was said to the king of the Chaldeans, <i>peccata tua eleemosynis redime.</i> (Daniel iv.)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Everlasting punishment.</i> The rewards and torments of a future life are declared by Jesus Christ, who is truth itself,
                           to be eternal. Let no one be found to argue hence against the goodness and mercy of God, for punishing sins committed in time
                           with punishments that are eternal. For 1. according to human laws, we see forgery and other crimes punished by death, which
                           is in some measure an eternal exclusion from society. 2. The will of the sinner is such, that he would sin eternally&nbsp;if
                           he could; it is an eternal God, a God of infinite majesty, who is offended. He essentially hates sin; and as, in hell there
                           is no redemption, the sin eternally continuing, the hatred God bears to sin must eternally continue, and with it eternal punishment.
                           The doctrine of those who pretend, with Origen, to question the eternity of the duration of hell's torments; who can say with
                           him, <i>video infernum quasi senescentum,</i> must encourage vice and embolden the sinner; for if the conviction of eternal
                           torments is not capable to restrain his malice, the doctrine of temporal punishment would be a much less restraint. The present
                           world would not be habitable, were there nothing for the wicked to apprehend after this life. There are many questions often
                           proposed with regard to the situation and nature of hell-fire, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. but in all these and similar objects
                           of curiosity, it is best to adhere to the sage reflection of St. Augustine: "When we dispute upon a point very obscure, without
                           any clear and certain documents from the holy Scripture, the presumption of man should stop short, and lean not more to one
                           than the other side." (lib. ii. de pecc. meritis et remiss. chap. xxxvi. ep. 190. ad Optat. chap. v. No. 16.) --- On a recapitulation
                           of this long and most interesting discourse, we may observe, that in the first place, it treats of those wars and persecutions
                           which are to happen in the latter ages of the world; that it next proceeds to describe the heresies and schisms among Christians;
                           the general propagation of the gospel; the great apostacy at the time of the Antichrist; and lastly, the grand and closing
                           scene of the day of judgment. Thus these grand and momentous events are intimately connected with each other, and all materially
                           regard the Church of Christ.</font></p></blockquote>
