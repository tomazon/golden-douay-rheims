                           Augustine, and others, suppose that the power of working miracles still remained in the Galatians, notwithstanding what had

                           with the Galatians; Abraham, who was never under the law, still received the grace of justification in reward of his faith,
                           even before he had received circumcision. Now, if a person can be justified without the law, the law can be no ways necessary

                           <I>Are under a curse....cursed is every man,</I> &amp;c. The sense of these is to be found in Deuteronomy xxvii. 26. in the
                           Septuagint. Some expound them thus: curses are pronounced against every one who keeps not all the precepts of the law, but
                           there is not any one; i.e. scarce any one, who keepeth them all; therefore all under the law are under some curse. But as
                           it cannot be said that no one kept all the precepts, especially the moral precepts of the law, mentioned in that place of
                           Deuteronomy; (for Zacharias and <I>Elizabeth were both just in the sight of God,</I> Luke i., and doubtless many others lived
                           so as not to incur those curses, but were just and were saved, though not by virtue of the works of the law only, nor without
                           faith in God, and in their Redeemer, who was to come) therefore others understand that all such persons fall under these curses,
                           who think to comply with all these precepts by their own strength, or who confide in the works of the law only, without faith
                           in Christ, the Messias, and without which they cannot be saved. This agrees with what follows, that <I>the just man liveth
                           by faith.</I> (Habacuc ii. 4.) See Romans i. 17. --- <I>Now</I> the law is not of faith, i.e. the works done merely in compliance
                           with the law, are not works of faith that can save a man: <I>but he that doth those things</I> of the law, <I>shall live in
                           them;</I> i.e. says St. Jerome, shall have a long temporal life promised in the law; or, as others say, shall have life everlasting,
                           if they are done with faith. --- <I>Christ hath redeemed us</I> from these curses; but to do this, hath made <I>himself a
                           curse</I> for <I>our</I> sake, by taking upon himself the similitude of a sinner, and by dying upon the cross, as if he had
                           been guilty of the greatest sins, having only charged himself with our sins, inasmuch as it <I>is written:</I> (Deuteronomy
                           xxi. 23.) <I>cursed is every one who hangeth on a tree;</I> which is to be understood, in case he deserve it for his own sins.
                           --- <I>That the blessing of Abraham</I> (or promised to Abraham) <I>might be fulfilled;</I> i.e. Christ redeemed us, that
                           these blessings might be fulfilled on all nations, and that all might receive the <I>promise of the Spirit,</I> or the promised
                           spirit of grace believing in Christ, who is now come. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>I speak after the manner of man;</I> or, by a comparison, says St. Chrysostom, common among men. If a man make or execute
                           his last will, or any deed or contract, it stands good; no one <I>contemns</I> it, or pretends to annul it, or add <I>any</I>
                           thing to it: how much more shall the testament, the covenant, or solemn promise which God made to Abraham, to bless all nations,
                           stand firm and have its effect? And he said to <I>his seed,</I> to <I>one,</I> i.e. in <I>Christ only,</I> not to <I>his seeds,
                           as it were by many.</I> It is observed, that the word <I>seed</I> being a collective signification, may grammatically be taken
                           for the plural as well as for the singular number; so that we are to have more regard to St. Paul's authority, who expounds
                           to us what is here signified by the word seed, than to the word itself. --- <I>The law which was made after four hundred and
                           thirty years</I> (consult the chronologists) does not make void the testament: nor the <I>promise</I> which God himself made
                           to Abraham, that mankind should be blessed only by Christ. These blessings could not be by the law of Moses <I>ordained,</I>
                           or delivered <I>by angels</I> in the <I>hand of a mediator,</I> to wit, of Moses, according to the common interpretation,
                           who, in receiving and publishing the law, was as it were a mediator betwixt God and his people. --- And <I>a mediator is not
                           of one,</I> (but is called so, as mediating betwixt two parties) <I>but God is one.</I> This is to signify, that when he made
                           the covenant or promise to Abraham, he made this promise himself, and did not make use of a mediator inferior to himself,
                           as when he gave the law; and the law, in this respect, was inferior to the promise; but the chief difference was, that true
                           justice and sanctification was not given by the law, for so it would have contradicted and have made void the promise made
                           before to Moses[Abraham?], that the blessings of true sanctification should only be by his seed and by faith in Christ, the
                           Son of Abraham and of David. According to the Scriptures all things (i.e. all men) were shut up together <I>under sin,</I>
                           under the slavery of sin, from which they were not to be redeemed but by the accomplishment of the promise, and by the coming
                           of Christ, by his grace, and faith in him. (Witham) --- <I>Because of transgressions.</I> To restrain them from sin, by fear
                           and threats. --- <I>Ordained by Angels.</I> The law was delivered by Angels, speaking in the name and person of God to Moses,
                           who was the <I>mediator</I> on this occasion between God and the people. (Challoner) --- The law was established not to occasion
                           sin, but to <I>manifest</I> sin, and to <I>punish</I> sin. Ezechiel (xx. 11.) shews the meaning of the apostle, when he says:
                           that God, after bringing the Israelites out of Egypt, imposed laws upon them that gave life to such as observed them. This
                           was the decalogue, published immediately after the passage of the Red Sea; but violating these commandments, they became guilty
                           of idolatry. To <I>punish</I> them, God imposed upon them precepts <I>which are not good, and which give not life.</I> (ver.
                           24, 25.) This is the ceremonial law, which was established and published by degrees during the forty years the Israelites
                           sojourned in the desert. It is then evident that this law was given to punish transgressions in the Israelites, and to prevent
                           relapses. This is the sense of St. Paul.</FONT></P><B>
