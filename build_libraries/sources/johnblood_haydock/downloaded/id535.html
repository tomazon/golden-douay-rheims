                           <I>Now:</I> literally, <I>And.</I> Thus the sacred history is connected, the last chapter of Deuteronomy being, in the opinion
                           of many, a part of the work of Josue. (Haydock) --- Moses died on the 1st of the 12th month, Adar, and as soon as that month
                           of mourning had expired, and the spies had returned on the 4th of Nisan, God ordered the people to prepare for their departure.
                           --- <I>Minister.</I> This was by no means degrading. He was designed for the successor of Moses, as Eliseus was to succeed
                           Elias. The heroes at Troy had servants of the same high character as themselves, attached to their persons by the ties of
                           friendship. See Exodus xvii. 10.</FONT></P><B>

                           a river well known, which rises in Antilibanus, not from Panion, but from the lake Phiala, as Herod the Tetrarch discovered
                           by throwing some straw into the latter, which passed by a subterraneous passage into Panion. Thence it proceeds to the Semonite
                           lake and to Daphne, where it begins to be called the Great Jordan. (Josephus, Jewish Wars iii. 33.) Having traversed the land
                           of Palestine in a southern direction, it loses itself in the lake of Sodom. (Calmet) --- It is a very rapid river, and hence
                           its appellation from <I>irod</I>, or <I>jord, descendit,</I> is very probably derived. (Haydock) --- The Arabs call it Zacchar,
                           "overflowing," because the snows and rains cause it <I>formerly</I> to overflow about Easter. (Universal History) --- When
                           Maundrell travelled through this country, the stream was too rapid for a person to swim against it. (Parkhurst) --- Hence
                           the miracle of the Hebrews passing through the Jordan on dry land, when its waters were the most copious and violent, would
                           be the more observable. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Thus the preceding permission, which the Jews extend, as if God had authorized them to conquer the whole world, is limited.
                           (Haydock) See Deuteronomy xi. 24. --- Their right to the land of Chanaan depends on this grant of God, who is the Lord of
                           all things, and who thus took away all the privileges of the former inhabitants. But the warrant of destruction only regarded
                           the people of Chanaan. Those who lived towards the Euphrates, were obliged only to pay tribute by David and Solomon, though
                           their country formed part of what had been promised to the Israelites. They might have possessed all that region, if they
                           had proved faithful. The limits of the promised land vary, as they are considered under various lights. (Calmet) --- The desert
                           of Arabia Petrea and Antilibanus formed the boundaries on the south and on the north, the Euphrates and Mediterranean were
                           on the east and west, when the territories of the Israelites were considered in their utmost extent. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           The manna still supplied the army after they had passed the Jordan, chap. v. 12. But Josue might fear lest the people might
                           not have liberty to gather it in the midst of the enemy's country, or he might perhaps suppose that this miraculous food would
                           be withdrawn, as soon as they had entered Chanaan. He therefore takes all necessary precautions, and gets other sorts of provisions
                           in the neighbourhood. (Calmet) --- This might foreshew, that in the primitive Church the ceremonies and privileges of the
                           old law would not be abrogated immediately, but they might be used for a time along with the rites of the gospel, till the
                           old law should be buried with honour. (Worthington) --- <I>Third day,</I> after their departure from Setim; or perhaps this
