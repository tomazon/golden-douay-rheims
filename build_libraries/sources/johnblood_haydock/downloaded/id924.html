                           the 30th of January, the year of the world 3414. (Usher) --- Some time after Nabuchodonosor left the siege, to attack the
                           Egyptians; (Jeremias xxxvii. 3.) and the people of Jerusalem, (Haydock) supposing that he would return no more, took back
                           their slaves, whom Jeremias had prevailed on them to liberate, according to the law, during the sabbatical year, Jeremias
                           xxxiv. 8. (Usher) --- The prophet reproached them for it; and announced the destruction of the city so plainly, that he was
                           thrown into prison, Jeremias xxi., and xxxiv., and xxxviii. --- <I>It.</I> The Babylonians had already taken all the towns

                           the city. (Haydock) --- During this siege it is thought, (Calmet) that mothers eat their children, (Lamentations iv. 10.,

                           the Antioch of Syria, (St. Jerome) which was styled also Epiphania, (Tirinus) or more probably Apamea, where Nabuchodonosor
                           was, when Jerusalem was taken. --- <I>Upon him,</I> by the advice of his council, Jeremias xxxix. 3, 13. Syriac, "they made
                           him answer the charges brought against him," (Calmet) of ingratitude and rebellion, as he had been appointed by the king of
                           Babylon, and had sworn to be faithful to him. (Menochius) --- This repeated infidelity made Nabuchodonosor resolve to remove
                           the people from their own country. (Calmet) --- He sentenced the last of the kings of Juda to see his children slain, (Haydock)
                           to have his eyes put out, and to remain in prison till his death, Jeremias lii. 11., &amp;c. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, he "spake
                           judgments with him." Thus was accomplished the prediction of Jeremias, (xxxiv. 3.) "thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the
                           king of Babylon, and he shall speak to thee." (Watson) --- The same prophet had said the same (Jeremias xxxii. 4.) before
                           he was thrown into prison. The sight of an angry judge is no small punishment. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           after they had been excruciated by the sight of his slaughtered children. He thus might be convinced, that there was no reason
                           to despise the predictions of Jeremias and of Ezechiel, (xii. 13.) as contradictory, because the latter informed him that
                           he should not <I>see</I> Babylon; though the other said that he should <I>die</I> there. --- <I>Babylon,</I> where he was
                           honourably buried, by order of Nabuchodonosor. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] x. 11.) --- Seder (Olam xxviii.) records that his
                           attendants sung, at his funeral, "Alas! king Sedecias is dead, having drunk the dregs of all ages;" as he suffered also for
                           the crimes of his predecessors. (Genebrard) (Tirinus) --- This is not indeed specified in Scripture: (Haydock) but it is highly
                           probable that Nabuchodonosor would thus "revere royalty, even in its ruins," if Daniel and the other Jews in power, had not
                           been careful to shew this mark of respect to their deceased monarch, conformably to the prediction of Jeremias; (xxxiv. 3.)
                           who foretold that he should die, not by a violent death, the usual fate of captive kings, but <I>in peace,</I> or on his bed,

                           This word is supplied from Jeremias lii. 13., and Hebrew, "great <I>man's</I> house." (Protestants) But Jeremias xxxix. 8.,
                           we read, they <I>burnt the houses of the people,</I> (Haydock) even the meanest, destroyed the walls, and took the people
                           to Babylon, only leaving some countrymen to cultivate the land. Jeremias was set at liberty by Nabuzardan, (ibid. xi.[Jeremias
                           xxxix. 9.?]) and chose to continue with this <I>remnant of the people,</I> for their comfort and direction. (Haydock) ---
                           They applied to him to know whether they should retire into Egypt; and after ten days, he gave them God's injunction to the
                           contrary: but they despised it, Jeremias xlii. 7., and xliii. 1. The prophet, and his secretary, Baruch, followed them into
                           Egypt. Thus was the country abandoned, and the monarchy at an end, after it had subsisted 468 years from the commencement
                           of David's reign. (Calmet) --- Yet some little power remained in the family of David, even at Babylon; (ver. 27.) and the
                           Jewish affairs were re-established, after the captivity, though not in such splendour as formerly, nor always under princes
                           of the same royal family. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>
