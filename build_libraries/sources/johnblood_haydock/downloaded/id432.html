                           was a figure of sin: and the observances prescribed in this and the following chapter, intimate what ought spiritually to
                           be done, in order to be delivered from so great an evil, or preserved from it. (Challoner) --- The authority of the priests
                           in the new law to bind or loose sins, was hereby prefigured. (St. Chrysostom, de Sacerd. 3.) (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           But none but the priests could declare them unclean, or set them at liberty. After they had pronounced sentence, the lepers

                           The white leprosy causeth no itching. (Gorrheus.; Celsus, v. 28.) Theodoret (q. 16,) says, it is incurable; and therefore,
                           the person infected is not shut up, out of pity. So St. Paul (1 Corinthians v. 11,) forbids us to eat with a dissolute Christian,
                           while he allows us to have commerce with infidels, though they be wholly corrupt. But others assert, it is not so difficult
                           to cure as that which is partial, ver. 14. The hand of Moses was stricken with this white leprosy, Exodus iv. 6. (Calmet)

                           country, is black; while yellow, or white hair, give reason to suspect leprosy; and (ver. 32,) the Hebrew says, "if there
                           be no yellow hair in it," which insinuates that it was black before. The Septuagint have explained both verses in the same
                           sense, as they found the negation also. If we admit it, we may distinguish black hair from that which approaches to brown,

                           Diss. on the Leprosy. --- This dreadful disorder is very common in Arabia and Palestine. During the holy wars many of the
                           Europeans were infected with it. The Jews believe, that the leprosy of garments and of houses was restrained to Judea, and
                           attacked them only when the people rebelled against God. (Oleaster) --- The providence of God often visited those, who would
