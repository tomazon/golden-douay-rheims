                           the city belonged to the priests, it is most probable that they would perform this office. Males indeed were to be offered
                           in the tabernacle. But this was an extraordinary case; so that, if there were no priests, the sacrifice might be lawful (Calmet)

                           "or mourning," was so called afterwards, on account of so many being slain; (Menochius) so the place, to which the Egyptians
                           accompanied the remains of Jacob, was styled "Abol," <i>the mourning of Egypt,</i> Genesis l. 11. (Haydock) --- The Septuagint
                           read <i>Abon,</i> "the stone." All the towns belonging to the Philistines, as far as this place, sent each their golden images,
                           or contributed towards those which were presented by the five lords. --- <i>Which,</i> ark, according to the Vulgate, though
                           some would explain it of the stone. The ark might remain here for some time, and would probably have continued longer, if
                           the people had not been so much afflicted. In the mean time, this record may have been written, as it was afterwards inserted
                           in this book. (Calmet) --- <i>Which,</i> though of the feminine gender, is referred to stone, because Abol is of that description,
                           (Menochius) and we find several such allusions to the Hebrew in our version. Protestants, "unto the great <i>stone of</i>
                           Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the Lord, <i>which stone remaineth</i> unto this day," &amp;c. (Haydock; Vatable, &amp;c.)
                           --- Others think that the ark remained there till it was removed to Cariathiarim, chap. vii. 1. Malvenda says, the <i>memory</i>
                           of the transaction was fresh till the author wrote; while others maintain, that the golden figures continued with the ark
                           till that time. (Calmet) --- The Roman Septuagint omits the words <i>till this day;</i> and reads, "where they placed upon
                           it (the stone) the ark....upon the stone in the field," &amp;c. Then with the Alexandrian copy, and Procopius, &amp;c., it
                           subjoins 19. "And the sons of Jechonias did not approve, among the men of Bethsames, that they saw the ark of the Lord, and
                           he slew of them 70 men, and 50,000 of the people." Theodoret suspects that they were more impious than the rest. But we might
                           as well say that they shewed more (Calmet) reverence, as we may explain <i>slew of them,</i> to denote the two curious citizens,
                           (Haydock) if any dependence could be had on this addition. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           there for some time, ver. 18. Hebrew, "because they had looked into, <i>or</i> at the ark." (Haydock) --- It was unlawful,
                           even for the Levites, to touch or to look <i>at</i> the ark uncovered; (Tirinus; Numbers iv. 15, 20,) and the Hebrew expression

                           will not allow that the latter number was slain. Out of that number, 70 were made victims of the divine justice. (Tirinus;
                           Sa) --- Bochart translates, "he slew 70 out of 50,000." The Syriac and Arabic read, "5070 men." Josephus only admits 70 who
                           were slain, "because they dared to touch the ark with their profane hands, as they were not priests." Hebrew, "and he slew

                           50,000 "were present." (Du Hamel) --- The Chaldean, Septuagint, &amp;c., constantly retain these numbers, and we must not
                           judge of God severity by our feeble reason. (Calmet) --- This decision is the most common. (Menochius) --- The people had
                           indulged their curiosity, to see whether the Philistines had taken the tables of the law out of the ark, &amp;c. (Serarius)

                           desired the people of Cariathiarim to convey the ark to their city, on the road to Silo, where they probably thought it ought
                           to be placed, in the tabernacle. But it seems God ordered it otherwise, and the ark was never restored to its former splendid
                           station, surrounded with all the vessels and ornaments of the tabernacle. David made something similar, and place an altar
                           before it, while the Mosaic tabernacle and altar were removed from Silo to Nobe, (chap. xxi. 1.) and afterwards to Gabaon,

                           ark was not placed in this most magnificent abode, but removed from the stone of Abel to the houses of Abinadab, of Obededom,
                           of David in Sion, till all the original ornaments, prescribed by God to Moses, with a still more splendid apparatus, met to
                           adorn the temple of Solomon, we cannot easily explain. Perhaps it might be to render that event more glorious, and to represent
                           the troubled state of the Jewish Synagogue, immediately preceding the appearance of the great Redeemer, who would establish
                           a church without spot or wrinkle, shining brighter than the sun, and replenished with all heavenly graces. (Haydock) --- Cariathiarim
                           is the same place as Cariathbaal, and Baala, (Josue xv. 9, 60.) Baalim Juda, (2 Kings vi. 2.) and Sedeiarim, about ten miles
                           from Jerusalem. Gabaa was "a hill," (Calmet) belonging to the same city, where the house of Abinadab stood; (Haydock) and
                           Nobe was also in the vicinity, while Silo was much farther north. (Calmet) --- The priests still remained, and offered sacrifice
                           in the tabernacle, though occasionally some of them might come to offer extraordinary victims before the ark, in those private
                           houses which were thus converted, as it were, into the holy of holies. Salien, the year of the world 2941, where he observes
                           from St. Jerome, that the tabernacle was removed to Nobe about the same time as the ark was deposited at Cariathiarim; and
                           no doubt both the translations were in consequence of the divine command, signified by the mouth of his prophet Samuel. (Haydock)</font></p><font
