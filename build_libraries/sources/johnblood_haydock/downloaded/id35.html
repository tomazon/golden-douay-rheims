                           <I>And after six days.</I> St. Matthew reckons neither the day of the promise, nor the day of the transfiguration; St. Luke,
                           including both, calls the interval <I>about eight days,</I>&nbsp;<I><U>osei emerai okto</U>.</I> (St. Chrysostom) --- He took
                           Peter, as head of the apostolic college; James, as first to shed his blood for the faith; and John, as he was to survive all
                           the rest, and to transmit to posterity the circumstances of this glorious mystery; or, according to St. Chrysostom on account
                           of their more excellent love, zeal, courage, sufferings and predilection. The mountain is generally believed to be Thabor,
                           and as such is considered by Christians as holy, and was much frequented by pilgrims, as St. Jerome testifies. Ven. Bede tells
                           us that three churches were built upon it; and Mr. Maundrell, in his <I>Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem,</I> p. 112, says
                           there are still three grottoes, made to represent the three tabernacles proposed by St. Peter. According to Le Brun, Thabor
                           is situated about 12 miles from the sea of Galilee, and eight from Nazareth. Others, however, do not think the transfiguration
                           took place on Mount Thabor, which was in the middle of Lower Galilee, because St. Mark (ix. 29,) says, that Christ and his
                           apostles, departing thence, passed <I>through</I> Galilee, and not <I>out</I> of Galilee, and suppose it might be Libanus,
                           because it was near Cæsarea Philippi; in the borders of which Christ appears at this time to have been, at least the promise
                           of the transfiguration was made there, and this place is distant about 60 miles from Mount Thabor. (Matthew xvi. 13.) ---
                           Mount Libanus is the highest in Palestine, according to St. Jerome; and of it Isaias prophesied: <I>"the glory of Libanus
                           is given to it, the beauty of Carmel and Saron; they shall see the glory of our God,"</I> xxxv. 2. (Tirinus) --- But, as we
                           said above, Thabor is very generally supposed to have been the mountain.</FONT></P><B>

                           consisted. He added to his former appearance splendour and glory, but laid not aside his substance. ... The Lord was transfigured

                           and Elias.</I> Jesus Christ had been taken by the people for Elias, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He therefore chose the
                           chief of all the prophets to be present, that he might shew his great superiority over them, and verify the illustrious confession
                           of Peter. The Jews had accused Christ of blasphemy, and of breaking the sabbath; the presence of Moses and Elias refuted the
                           calumny; for the founder of the Jewish laws would never have sanctioned him who was a transgressor of those laws; and Elias,
                           so full of zeal for the glory of God, would never have paid homage to one who made himself equal to God, had he not really
                           been the Son of the Most High. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lvii.) --- St. Hilary thinks that Moses and Elias (who represent the
                           law and the prophets, and who here bear witness to the divinity of Jesus Christ,) will be the precursors of his second coming,
                           alluded to in Revelations, chap. xi, though the general opinion of the Fathers is, that the two witnesses there mentioned
                           are Enoch and Elias. (Jansenius) --- It is hence evident, that the saints departed can and do, with the permission of God,
                           take an interest in the affairs of the living. (St. Augustine, <I>de curâ pro mort. </I>chap. xv. 16.) --- For as angels elsewhere,
                           so here the saints also, served our Saviour; and as angels, both in the Old and New Testament, were frequently present at
                           the affairs of men, so may saints. (Bristow) --- All interpreters agree, that Elias appeared in his own body, but various
                           are their opinions with regard to the apparition of Moses. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           were very much afraid.</I> There were two causes that might produce this fear in the apostles, the cloud that overshadowed
                           them, or the voice of God the Father, which they heard. Their human weakness could not bear such refulgent beams of glory,
                           and trembling in every limb, they fall prostrate on the ground. (St. Jerome) --- The Almighty, it seems, was pleased to fulfil
                           the wish of Peter, thereby to shew that Himself is the tent or pavilion, under the shade of which the blessed shall live for
                           ever, and to sanction the public and explicit confession of Peter relative to the divinity of Jesus Christ, by his own no
                           less public and explicit confession, joined with an express command to hear and obey him. St. Chrysostom very justly remarks,
                           that this voice was not heard till after the departure of Moses and Elias, that no possible doubt might exist to whom it was
                           referred, and that it was to Christ only and to no other. --- <I>Hear ye Him:</I> i.e. as the law and the prophets are fulfilled
                           and verified in Jesus Christ, your new legislator and prophet, you are to hear and obey Him in preference to either Moses
                           or Elias, or any other teacher. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           who was Elias in spirit, is already come. See Matthew xi. 14. (Witham) --- This was a vulgar error spread by the Scribes among
                           the Jewish people. It proceeded from an erroneous interpretation of Scripture. They confounded the two comings of our Saviour.
                           The Baptist was the precursor of Christ at his first coming, and was styled by our Lord Elias, because he performed the office
                           of Elias; and <I>he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elias.</I> (Luke i. 17.) --- But this prophet in person
                           will be the precursor of the second coming of Christ. Whereby Malachias, predicting this coming of Christ, says: <I>I will
                           send to you Elias the Thesbite;</I> thus evidently distinguishing him from the Baptist, who was also Elias in spirit and in
                           the dignity of his office. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lviii.) --- Jesus Christ here confirms the literal sense of the prophecy;
                           (Malachias iv. 5,) but, in the next verse, he shews a prior, though less perfect accomplishment of the same in the person
                           of John the Baptist, who was raised by God to prepare the ways of the Lord.</FONT></P><B>

                           from this inculpation, imputing the fault entirely to the man himself. For it is evident, from many circumstances, that he
                           was weak in faith. Our Saviour does not inveigh against this man alone, not to wound his feelings too sensibly, but against
                           the whole people of the Jews. We may infer, that many of the bystanders entertained false notions of his disciples, from these
                           words of deserved reproach: <I>O! unbelieving and incredulous generation, how long shall I be with you?</I> In which words,
                           he shews us how much he wished for his passion, and his departure hence. (St. Chrysostom) --- We must not imagine that our
                           Saviour, who was meekness and mildness itself, uttered on this occasion words of anger and intemperance. Not unlike a feeling
                           and tender physician, observing his patient totally disregarding his prescriptions, he says, How long shall I visit you; how
                           long shall I order one thing, and you do the contrary? Thus Jesus is not angry with the man, but with the vices of the man;
                           and in him he upbraids the Jews, in general, for their incredulity and perversity. (St. Jerome) --- The general sentiment
                           is, that these reproaches are limited to the people; some extend them to the apostles. See below, ver. 19. (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>

                           their power of working miracles. They come therefore secretly to Jesus Christ, to learn why they could not cast out devils.
                           He answered them, that it was their want of faith, which probably failed them on this occasion, on account of the difficulty
                           of the cure, little reflecting that the virtue of the Lord, which worked in them, was superior to every possible evil of both
                           mind and body. --- St. Hilary is of opinion, that during the absence of Christ on the mountain, the fervour of the apostles
                           had begun to abate. (Jansenius)</FONT></P><B>

                           you have faith as a grain of mustard-seed.</I> Christ insinuates to his apostles, as if they had not yet faith enough to work
                           great miracles, which require a firm faith joined with a lively confidence in God. The mustard-seed is brought in with an
                           allusion to its hot and active qualities. (Witham) --- That is, a perfect faith; which, in its properties and its fruits,
                           resembles the grain of mustard-seed in the parable. (Chap. xii.[xiii.?] 31.) (Challoner) --- By faith is here understood,
                           not that virtue by which we assent to all things that are to be believed of Christ, the first, of the theological virtues,
                           in which the apostles were not deficient, but that confidence in the power and goodness of God, that he will on such an occasion
                           exert these, his attributes, in favour of the supplicant. To have a true faith of this kind, and free from all presumption,
                           is a great and high privilege, which the Holy Ghost breathes into such only as he pleases. (Jansenius) --- Examples of this
                           efficacious faith are given by St. Paul. (Hebrews chap. ii.[xi.?]) St. Gregory of Neo-Cæsarea is also related, by Eusebius
                           and Ven. Bede, to have removed by the efficacy of his faith a rock, which obstructed the building of a church; thus literally
                           fulfilling the promise of Jesus Christ. (Tirinus) --- The faith of the apostles, especially of those that had not been present
                           at the transfiguration, was not perfect and complete in all its parts, till after the resurrection and ascension of Jesus
                           Christ, and the descent of the Holy Ghost. (Haydock) --- St. Jerome understands by <I>mountains,</I> things the most difficult
                           to be effected.</FONT></P><B>

                           follows Scripture, when she uses besides the name of Jesus, many prayers and much fasting to drive out the devils, because

                           to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom, </I>&amp;c. The word children then does not mean subjects, but must be understood
                           in its natural limited sense. (Jansenius) --- Jesus Christ argues <I>a minori ad majus</I> thus, if the kings of the earth

                           says St. Chrysostom had he not really been the Son of God. (hom. lix.) Our Saviour uniformly waved his right to exemptions
                           in temporal things: he declares every where that temporal princes have nothing to fear from him, or his doctrines, since his
                           kingdom is not of this world. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           might give rise to the strife and contention of the disciples, in the commencement of the ensuing chapter, on the subject
