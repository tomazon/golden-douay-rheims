                                    the day of scenopegia, and the day of the fire, that was given when Nehemias offered sacrifice, after the temple and the altar
                                    was built.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests that then were
                                    worshippers of God, took privately the fire from the altar, and hid it in a valley where there was a deep pit without water,
                                    and there they kept it safe, so that the place was unknown to all men.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 But when many years had passed, and it pleased God that Nehemias should
                                    be sent by the king of Persia, he sent some of the posterity of those priests that had hid it, to seek for the fire: and as
                                    they told us, they found no fire, but thick water.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 Then he bade them draw it up, and bring it to him: and the priest,
                                    Nehemias, commanded the sacrifices that were laid on, to be sprinkled with the same water, both the wood, and the things that
                                    were laid upon it.</font></p>

                                    which before was in a cloud, there was a great fire kindled, so that all wondered.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And all the priests made prayer, while the sacrifice was consuming,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And the prayer of Nehemias was after this manner: O <strong>Lord</strong>

                                    that was left to be poured out upon the great stones. 32 Which being done, there was kindled a flame from them: but it was
                                    consumed by the light that shined from the altar.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And when this matter became public, it was told to the king of Persia,
                                    that in the place where the priests that were led away, had hid the fire, there appeared water, with which Nehemias and they
                                    that were with him had purified the sacrifices.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And the king considering, and diligently examining the matter, made
                                    a temple for it, that he might prove what had happened.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And when he had proved it, he gave the priests many goods, and divers
                                    presents, and he took and distributed them to them with his own hand. </font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And Nehemias called this place Nephthar, which is interpreted purification.
