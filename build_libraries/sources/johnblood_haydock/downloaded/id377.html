                           whose business it was to embalm dead bodies, with a composition of myrrh, &amp;c., in order to keep them from putrefaction,
                           (Menochius) as the Egyptian mummies are treated. (Haydock) --- The entrails are taken out, &amp;c., by the embalmer during
                           30 days, and the body is left in salt and various drugs, for other 40, in all 70 days, as Herodotus informs us, (B. xi. 86,)
                           and as Moses here insinuates, ver. 3. This was an honour peculiar to the kings. Before any person was buried, his praises
                           were rehearsed; and it was lawful on this occasion to declare, what evil even the kings themselves had done; which sometimes
                           caused them to be deprived of funeral honours. We have several funeral canticles preserved in Scripture: 2 Kings i. 18; iii.
                           33; 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 25. (Calmet) --- The Lamentations of Jeremias were perhaps of this nature, on the death of King
                           Josias. The usual time for mourning among the Jews, was 30 days for people of eminence, (Numbers xx.; Deuteronomy xxxiv. 8;
                           Procopius) and seven for the rest, Ecclesiasticus xxii. 13. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           adorned with golden letters and hieroglyphics, various bandages, &amp;c. They are laid in coffins. Some pretend that Joseph
                           was afterwards adored in Egypt, under the names of Serapis and Osiris: but the grounds of this supposition are only a few
                           uncertain etymologies and emblems, which might agree with him as well as with those modern deities: (Calmet) at least it does
                           not at all appear probable, that he was adored in Egypt before the departure of the Israelites, as the king who persecuted
                           them did not know Joseph, Exodus i. 8. His greatest glory was, to have prefigured Jesus Christ in so wonderful a manner during
                           the course of his life, and to have been replenished with all the graces which could form the character of a great man and
                           a saint. Some think, that the history of Joseph has been imitated in the fable of Proteus, or Cetes, king of Egypt. See the
                           True History of Fabulous Times, by Juerin du Roche, a virtuous and learned ecclesiastic, who was put to death for his faith,
                           at Paris, September 8, 1792. See also Rollin's Abridgment. (Haydock)</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT><FONT

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And they sent a message to him, saying: Thy father commanded us before

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And he answered them: Fear not: can we resist the will of God?</font></p>
