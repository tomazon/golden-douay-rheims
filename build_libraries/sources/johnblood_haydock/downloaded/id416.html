                           Formerly all sorts of metal, silver, copper, tin, &amp;c., were used for mirrors, till the Europeans began to make them of
                           glass. The best were made of a mixture of copper and tin. (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxxiii. 9.) --- <I>Watched.</I> Hebrew,
                           served like soldiers: fasting and praying, according to the Septuagint and Chaldean. These devout women came thither with
                           great alacrity, to shew their affection towards God, and to consecrate to his service what had hitherto served to nourish
                           vanity. Such were the virgins, mentioned [in]&nbsp;2 Machabees iii. 19, and those who were abused by the sons of Heli, 1 Kings
                           ii. 22. Ann, the prophetess, and our blessed Lady[Virgin Mary], were thus also employed in the temple, Luke ii. 37. Women
                           kept watch, singing and dancing before the palace of the Persian kings. (Calmet) --- When the tabernacle was fixed at Silo,
                           small apartments were probably built for the convenience of these pious women. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           their chaptrels were covered with silver." Bonfrere supposes that the pillars were of the Ionic order, and that the chaptrels

                           amounting to 603,550 men." Hence the talent would weigh exactly 3000 sicles, (Calmet) or 12,000 drachmas. Some say that the
                           common talent weighed 100 pounds, and that of the sanctuary 120, each pound containing 25 sicles. (Du Hamel)</FONT></P><B>
