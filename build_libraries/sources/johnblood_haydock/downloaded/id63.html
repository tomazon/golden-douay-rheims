                           Mark says very early, the sun being now risen, whereas St. John tells us that it was yet dark. But when St. Mark says the
                           sun was risen, he means that it began, by its approach to the horizon, to enlighten the heavens, at which time there is still
                           darkness remaining, (according to St. John) which decreases as light approaches the earth. (St. Augustine)</FONT></P><B>

                           Matthew says the angel was sitting on the stone, whilst St. Mark says that they saw him sitting on the right side of the sepulchre.
                           This must not surprise us; for the angel which first appeared sitting upon the stone, might have been afterwards seen by him
                           sitting on the right side of the sepulchre. (Theophylactus) --- Perhaps the angel mentioned by St. Matthew is different from
                           the one mentioned by St. Mark. Or it may be understood, that the women entering the monument, which may mean the enclosure
                           of it, saw the angel sitting on the stone, which was placed on the right side of the sepulchre. (St. Augustine)</FONT></P><B>

                           appearance of our Saviour is more fully related by St. John. Our Lord arose early from the monument in which he had been placed
                           late in the evening, thus fulfilling the words of the psalmist: <I>In the evening weeping shall have place, and in the morning
                           gladness.</I> (Psalm xxix.) (Ven. Bede) --- <I>Rising early.</I> It appears from this that our Saviour arose early, about
                           sunrise, as was the sentiment of St. Augustine; though St. Gregory seems to think that he arose at midnight, in the same manner
                           as Samson, who was a figure of Christ, arose in the middle of the night and carried away the gates of Gaza. If we follow this
                           opinion, we must understand the word <I>early</I> as referring to the verb <I>appeared,</I> not to the participle <I>rising,</I>
                           and then the sentence will be: <I>he rising,</I> (having arisen) <I>appeared early the first day of the week.</I> The first
                           interpretation, however, of St. Augustine seems more agreeable to the text: <I>he rising early the first day of the week,
                           appeared,</I> &amp;c.</FONT></P><B>

                           and compare the four gospels, this was not the last time that Christ appeared to his disciples after his resurrection. We
                           can only then understand it of the <I>last</I> time mentioned by this evangelist. --- <I>To the eleven.</I> If this apparition
                           (as it was the&nbsp;opinion of St. Augustine) was made when St. Thomas was not with them, they were only then ten, without
                           St. Thomas and Judas. The evangelist here calls them <I>eleven,</I> because the apostolical college (Judas being dead) consisted
                           of no more than <I>eleven.</I> And this way of speaking may be justified by diverse examples: one instance may suffice. A
                           meeting of the Jewish <I>sanhedrim</I> might be called the <I>Council of the Seventy-two,</I> though it many times happened
                           that all the seventy-two were not there present. (Witham) --- Some think that this was the last apparition of Jesus Christ,
                           after which he quitted the earth, and ascended into heaven. (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>

                           these words it is not to be understood that Jesus is to be confined to that particular posture of body, or that the Father
                           has any hands, or any human shape; for God is a pure, incorporeal, and all-perfect Spirit. The image of God, as he is in himself,
                           comes not within the reach of our mortal senses. When the Scripture, therefore, speaks of God, it uses such imagery of language
                           as is adapted to our senses, that it may thereby convey to us some imperfect knowledge of those sublime mysteries, which are
                           ineffable in themselves, and incomprehensible to our understanding. Thus we are informed that Jesus Christ sits at the right
                           hand of God, the Father Almighty, to signify that, as man, our Lord is raised to the height of glory, and to that supreme
                           beatitude, than which there is nothing higher, and nothing greater in the whole bliss of heaven; and that he moreover holds
                           the same sovereign dominion with the Father over all creatures; because, as God, he is equal to the Father in power, in wisdom,
                           and in all perfection. See Pouget, p. 256. ed. in fol. --- <I>On the right hand of God.</I> Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, was
                           not man only, but truly God, the same God with his eternal Father: and hereby is signified that the <I>person,</I> who took
                           upon him human nature, and became man, is equal in dignity with the Father: he, who, as man, ascended into heaven. [2] When
                           St. Jerome says that most Greek copies wanted this chapter, he speaks not of chapters according to our present division, but
                           only of the last 12 verses, which formerly made what was called a <I>little chapter:</I> yet these twelve verses must have
                           been omitted in those manuscripts by some negligent transcribers. Now they are found in all, both Latin and Greek copies.
                           They are found in the Canons of Eusebius on the Gospels; in St. Jerome in several places; in St. Ambrose, lib. iii, in Luc.
                           tom. iii, p. 292. Ed. Paris, an. 1582; in St. Augustine, lib. iii, de consensu Evang. chap. xxv, tom. 3, part 2, p. 142, &amp;c.
                           (Witham) --- St. Gregory of Nyssa, (orat. 2. de Resurr.) says, that the best copies of St. Mark's gospel finished with the
                           8th verse, <I>a trembling and fear had seized them:&nbsp;<U>En tois akribesterois to Kata Markon Euaggelion mekri tou ephobounto
                           gar, echei to telos</U>.</I> It is the very generally received sentiment of the learned, that the last 12 verses were given
                           by St. Mark; and the most probable reason yet offered for the omission of them in various copies is, that the transcribers
                           followed a mutilated copy, where the last page was wanting. (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>
