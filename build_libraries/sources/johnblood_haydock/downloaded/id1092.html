                           overcome the crocodile. God is here speaking. Septuagint, "Dost thou not fear, since it is ready for thee, (Grabe substitutes,

                           the strength and beauty of the crocodile should be made known. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "I will not conceal his parts, nor
                           his power, nor his comely proportion." Theo.[Theodotion?] in Septuagint, "I will not keep silence on his account, and the

                           its open mouth, like bits, which they hold with both hands, they conduct it to the river side, and kill it. (Pliny viii. 25.)
                           --- Septuagint, "Who would enter the wrinkles of his breast, (Calmet) <i>or</i> the folds of its coat of arms?" which may
                           allude to the almost impenetrable scales of the leviathan. (Haydock) --- Symmachus, "Who will enter the folds of its scales?"
                           The crocodile can open its mouth so wide as to swallow a heifer, or to let a man stand upright. (Calmet) --- Each jaw is furnished
