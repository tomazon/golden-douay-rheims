                           Antioch the disciples were first named Christians,</I> when St. Paul and St. Barnabas were preaching there. Before that, they
                           were called the <I>disciples</I> of Jesus, and sometimes <I>Nazarenes,</I> (see Acts xxiv. 5.) or perhaps <I>Galileans.</I>
                           This honourable name of <I>Christians,</I> distinguished them from Gentiles and Jews, and from all heretical sects, who generally
                           had some name from the authors of such sects, as <I>Simonites, Cerinthians, Nicolaits,</I> &amp;c. Of which see St. Epiphanius.
                           The faithful had also after some time the name of <I>Catholics,</I> being taught in the apostles' creed to <I>believe in the
                           Catholic Church.</I> And St. Augustine, in several places, takes notice, that no heretics could ever get themselves called
                           by this name; nor can they to this present. See St. Augustine, de util. credendi. chap. viii.; de vera relig. chap. vii.;
                           cont. epis. fundam. chap. iv. Whosoever is of the true faith of Christ, may justly say, <I>Christian</I> is my name, <I>Catholic</I>
                           my surname: a greater honour, and a greater advantage, than to be of any royal family. (Witham) --- The faithful disciples,
                           believers, &amp;c. as before they were called, now received the name of Christians. It is not certain whether they took the
                           name themselves, or it was given them out of disrespect, by the pagans. Galileans was a term of reproach likewise given to
                           the Christians. St. Peter, in his first epistle, uses the appellation of Christians; but it does not appear that St. Paul
                           ever did in any of his writings. (Calmet, Tirinus, &amp;c.) --- The name of Christian should be common to all the faithful,
                           and all other new names of sectaries abhorred. "If you hear," says St. Jerome, any where such as are said to be of Christ,
                           "not to have their name from Christ, but from some other, as Marcionites, Valentinians, (as now also Lutherans, Calvinists,
                           &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.) know that they belong not to the Church of Christ, but to the synagogue of Antichrist." St.
                           Pacianus, in his letter to Sympronian, says, when heresies had arisen, and endeavoured by diverse names to tear the dove of
                           the Lord and Queen in pieces, the faithful required their surname: hence they who before were called <I>Christians,</I> are
                           now surnamed also <I>Catholics.</I> Christian is my name and Catholic my surname. By this term <I>Catholic,</I> the apostles,
                           in their creed, have distinguished the one true visible Church from all and every other congregation, sect, or party. This
                           mark is so self-evident, that St. Augustine hesitates not to say: "In the lap of the Church the very name <I>Catholic</I>
                           keepeth me." (Cont. ep. fund. chap. iv.) --- Again, in his book on the utility of believing, he says: "if after these troubles
                           of mind you still are tossed and vexed, and wish for peace, follow the way of Catholic discipline, which from Christ himself,
                           by the apostles, hath proceeded even unto us, and shall proceed form hence to the latest posterity." (1 Timothy iii. 15.)</FONT></P><B>

                           dwell in Judea.</I> Most of the faithful in Jerusalem, who wished to live perfect lives, had sold their possessions, and placed
                           the price in the hands of the apostles; and many others, who had not voluntarily relinquished their property, had probably
                           lost most of it in the persecutions. Hence arose the particular distress of the brethren in Jerusalem, to relieve which the
                           Gentiles made collections. It was meet, that they who had been made partakers of their spiritual goods, should now in time
                           of need administer to them of their temporal substance. (Denis the Carthusian) --- Imitate the alms of these primitive Christians,
                           and make to yourselves provision against another life. Oh how many are now clothed in silks, and abound in pleasures, but

                           it to the ancients;</I>[2] elders, &amp;c. In this and diverse other places, are not to be understood such as were elder in
                           age, but such as had offices and dignities, and by divine authority, and who with a due subordination were to govern the Church:
                           so that by this word, were signified apostles, bishops, and priests. But of this more hereafter. (Witham) --- The ancients
                           or priests, seniors,&nbsp;<I><U>presbuterous</U>.</I> This is the first place in the New Testament, where <I>priests</I> are
                           mentioned. Some interpreters think, that by this word, <I>ancients,</I> are meant the apostles; but this is not likely. The
                           apostles must at that time have been dispersed over all the world. Others think it was some of the older deacons, who had
                           charge of the alms. We like the opinion of those who think it means <I>priests,</I> subordinate to the apostles, who had the
                           charge of governing the faithful, in their absence. Thus the Christian Church will appear modelled after the form of the synagogue.
                           First, the bishop, who presides, corresponding to the head of the synagogue; the priests, to the ancients, who sat on the
                           right and left of the chief; and the deacons, to the disciples of the Scribes, who studied the law. It must be allowed that
                           many passages occur in Scripture, which it seems necessary to explain of priests of the second rank. St. Paul, (1 Timothy
                           v. 1. 17. 19.) St. James (v. 14) orders the priests to be called to anoint the sick man, which cannot be explained of bishops,
                           as there was only one in each town. It must nevertheless be observed, that this same word <I>ancient,</I> or <I>priest,</I>
                           is often used in Scripture, and primitive writings, to designate a bishop. (Calmet)</FONT></P>
