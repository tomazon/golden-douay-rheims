                           apostle proves what he had advanced in the last chapter, that the Jews cannot be justified by the works of the written law,
                           nor by any works, unless joined with faith in the Messias, their Redeemer. This he shews by the example of Abraham, who is
                           said to have been justified by believing; 2. and this was before he was circumcised; 3. and long before the law of Moses.
                           Justification was then given without the works of that law. --- <I>What</I> advantage <I>shall we say, then, that Abraham
                           hath found, who is our father according to the flesh?</I> This seems the true construction and sense: rather than what did

                           what saith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.</I>[1] The Scripture, therefore, teacheth
                           us that he became just by his faith. And as he had this faith by the grace of God, grace was the cause of his justification,
                           and not any works without grace. And when it is said, <I>it was reputed to him,</I> we must not understand an imputation of
                           being just without a true and interior justice: for to be reputed just in the sight of God, who sees the heart, and sanctifies
                           the soul by his interior grace, is the only true justice that can make a man acceptable to God. As not to have our <I>sins
                           imputed</I> in the sight of God, is to have them forgiven, and to be free from our sins. (Witham) --- <I>Reputed,</I> &amp;c.

                           our justification proceedeth from God's free grace and bounty; and not from any efficacy which any act of ours could have
                           of its own nature, abstracting from God's grace. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           gift; but when it is said he <I>believed and was justified,</I> (this belief or faith was always a liberal gift of God) and
                           when no mention is made of his works, it appears that such a justification and sanctification are not from the works of the
                           written law, nor from any works he could do of himself, but that they are <I>according to the purpose,</I> or decree <I>of

                           then merit his vocation to the faith by his works. But when God had called him, and made him depart from his country, when
                           he promised to him an innumerable posterity, Abraham believed in his promises, and it was reputed to him unto justice, that
                           his faith and his justice were the pure gift of God. His faith was not a dead and speculative faith only, but an active faith,
                           a faith animated by charity, as appears from the sequel of his life. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           and vested with the stole of charity. (Challoner) --- When it is said that the sins of man are covered, we must not imagine
                           that they still remain, but on account of the goodness of God will not be punished, as the Lutherans contend; for the justice
                           of God could not suffer this: but by it we must understand that they are entirely blotted out, and neither exist, nor are
                           considered any longer by God. Still, we must not conclude that man is blessed, as soon as sin is remitted; since the same
                           psalmist, in another place, ascribes happiness to man when he walks in the law of the Lord, and when he keeps judgment and
                           does justice. (Psalms i; cv; and cviii.) And our Saviour says, <I>If you know these things, blessed shall you be if you do
                           them.</I> (St. John xiii.) (Estius) --- Moreover, if sins were never blotted out, but only covered, why did the royal prophet
                           pray to the Almighty, saying: <I>blot out all mine iniquities;</I> and in different parts of the 50th psalm and psalm cviii,
                           speaking of the egregious sinner, he says: <I>let the sin of his mother not be blotted out;</I> which would mean nothing at
                           all, if sins were never blotted out? (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           in the times of David and Solomon, when they ruled over the neighbouring nations. But others think that the apostle alludes
                           to the passage of Genesis, where the Almighty promises that in his (Abraham's) seed, all the nations of the earth should be
                           blessed; which promise extends much beyond the narrow limits of Chanaan. In fine, it may be understood in a spiritual sense,
                           of his dignity of father of all the faithful; which makes him, in a manner, master of the whole world, since his spiritual
                           children, spread through the whole world, have the universe for their inheritance. (Calmet) --- Postula a me, et dabo tibi
                           Gentes hæreditatem tuam et possessionem tuam terminos terræ. (Psalm ii. 8.) (Haydock) --- It was by Christ that Abraham was
                           to <I>be heir</I> of the world, in as much as the spiritual kingdom of Christ should be spread over all the world. And this
                           of one who was of the seed of David, being heir of the world, was not <I>by the law,</I> or by virtue of the law, which was
                           not given to Moses till 400 years after. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>
