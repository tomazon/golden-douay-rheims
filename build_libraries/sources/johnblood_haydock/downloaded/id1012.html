                           and their sincere repentance. (Haydock) --- On days of mourning, the Jews assembled four times to pray, and thrice on other
                           days, by the institution of Esdras. (Maimonides) See Acts iii. 1. --- On their fasts, they refrained from all meat, as well
                           as from work, spending their time in prayer. They began at the first hour, and continued their exercises of devotion till
                           the third, when they recommenced for other three hours. They did the like at the sixth and ninth hours; hearing the law, then
                           prostrating themselves to confess their sins. Afterwards they rose to join with the Levites in praising the Lord. (Calmet)</font></p><b>
