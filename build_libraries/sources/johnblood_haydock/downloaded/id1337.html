                                    <P>2 Declare ye among the nations, and publish it, lift up a standard: proclaim, and conceal it not: say: Babylon is taken,
                                    Bel is confounded, Merodach is overthrown, their graven things are confounded, their idols are overthrown.</P>
                                    <P>3 For a nation is come up against her out of the north, which shall make her land desolate: and there shall be none to
                                    dwell therein, from man even to beast: yea, they are removed, and gone away.</P>
                                    <P>4 In these days, and at that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Juda together:
                                    going and weeping, they shall make haste, and shall seek the Lord their God.</P>
                                    <P>5 They shall ask the way to Sion, their faces <I>are </I>hitherward. They shall come, and shall be joined to the Lord by
                                    an everlasting covenant, which shall never be forgotten.</P>
                                    <P>6 My people have been a lost flock, their shepherds have caused them to go astray, and have made them wander in the mountains:
                                    they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting-place.</P>
                                    <P>7 All that found them, have devoured them: and their enemies said: We have not sinned <I>in so doing:</I> because they
                                    have sinned against the Lord, the beauty of justice, and against the Lord, the hope of their fathers.</P>
                                    <P>8 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans: and be ye as kids at the head of the

                                    <P>9 For behold I raise up, and will bring against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the land of the north: and they
                                    shall be prepared against her, and from thence she shall be taken: their arrows, like those of a mighty man, a destroyer,
                                    shall not return in vain.</P>
                                    <P>10 And Chaldea shall be made a prey: all that waste her shall be filled, saith the Lord.</P>
                                    <P>11 Because you rejoice, and speak great things, pillaging my inheritance: because you are spread abroad as calves upon
                                    the grass, and have bellowed as bulls.</P>
                                    <P>12 Your mother is confounded exceedingly, and she that bore you is made even with the dust: behold she shall be the last
                                    among the nations, a wilderness unpassable, and dry.</P>
                                    <P>13 Because of the wrath of the Lord, it shall not be inhabited, but shall be wholly desolate: every one that shall pass
                                    by Babylon, shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</P>
                                    <P>14 Prepare yourselves against Babylon, round about, all you that bend the bow: fight against her, spare not arrows: because
                                    she hath sinned against the Lord.</P>
                                    <P>15 Shout against her, she hath everywhere given her hand, her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down, for it
                                    is the vengeance of the Lord. Take vengeance upon her: as she hath done, so do to her.</P>
                                    <P>16 Destroy the sower out of Babylon, and him that holdeth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the sword of the
                                    dove every man shall return to his people, and every one shall flee to his own land.</P>
                                    <P>17 Israel is a scattered flock, the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria devoured him: and last this Nabuchodonosor,
                                    king of Babylon, hath broken his bones.</P>
                                    <P>18 Therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will visit the king of Babylon and his land, as
                                    I have visited the king of Assyria.</P>
                                    <P>19 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation: and he shall feed on Carmel, and Basan, and his soul shall be satisfied
                                    in Mount Ephraim, and Galaad.</P>
                                    <P>20 In those days, and at that time, saith the Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none:
                                    and the sin of Juda, and there shall none be found: for I will be merciful to them, whom I shall leave.</P>
                                    <P>21 Go up against the land of the rulers, and punish the inhabitants thereof, waste, and destroy all behind them, saith
                                    the Lord: and do according to all that I have commanded thee.</P>

                                    and caught, because thou hast provoked the Lord.</P>
                                    <P>25 The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his wrath : for the Lord, the God of hosts,
                                    hath a work to be done in the land of the Chaldeans.</P>

                                    of the Lord, our God, the revenge of his temple.</P>
                                    <P>29 Declare to many against Babylon, to all that bend the bow: stand together against her round about, and let none escape:
                                    pay her according to her work: *according to all that she hath done, do ye to her: for she hath lifted up herself against
                                    the Lord, against the holy One of Israel.</P>
                                    <P>30 Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets: and all her men of war shall hold their peace in that day, saith
                                    the Lord.</P>
                                    <P>31 Behold I <I>come against</I> thee, O proud one, saith the Lord, the God of hosts: for thy day is come, the time of thy
                                    visitation.</P>
                                    <P>32 And the proud one shall fall, he shall fall down, and there shall be none to lift him up: and I will kindle a fire in
                                    his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.</P>
                                    <P>33 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: The children of Israel, and the children of Juda are oppressed together: all that have
                                    taken them captives, hold them fast, they will not let them go.</P>
                                    <P>34 Their Redeemer is strong, the Lord of hosts is his name, he will defend their cause in judgment, to terrify the land,
                                    and to disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</P>

                                    <P>42 They shall take the bow and the shield: they are cruel and unmerciful: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they
                                    shall ride upon horses: like a man prepared for battle against thee, O daughter of Babylon.</P>
                                    <P>43 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands are grown feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, pangs
                                    as a woman in labour.</P>
                                    <P>44 *Behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan to the strong and beautiful: for I will make him
                                    run suddenly upon her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may appoint over her? for who is like to me? and who shall bear
                                    up against me? **and who is that shepherd that can withstand my countenance?</P>
                                    <P>45 Therefore, hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath taken against Babylon: and his thoughts which he hath thought
                                    against the land of the Chaldeans: surely the little ones of the flocks shall pull them down, of a truth their habitation
                                    shall be destroyed with them.</P>
                                    <P>46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard amongst the nations.</P>
