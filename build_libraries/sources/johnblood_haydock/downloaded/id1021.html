                           subjects had been made prisoner, and was now at Babylon; or, if returned, (Haydock) was wholly taken up with the concerns
                           of his soul, and committed the care of affairs to Eliachim. See Josephus, [Antiquities?] x. 4., and 2 Paralipomenon xxxiii.

                           giving orders to seize the mountainous ascents, by which there was a passage into Judea; and it was easy to stop their progress,
                           as the passage was narrow, and would not admit above two men at once." This reminds us of the heroic resistance which Leonidas,
                           with his 300 Spartans, made to the millions in the army of Xerxes, at Thermopylæ. (Haydock) --- It seems that Jews attempted
                           to defend these defiles. They had received the orders before the enemy encamped near Scythopolis.</font></p><b>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And all the people cried to the Lord with great earnestness, and they
                                    humbled their souls in fastings, and prayers, both they and their wives.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And the priests put on hair-cloths, and they caused the little children
                                    to lie prostrate before the temple of the Lord, and the altar of the Lord they covered with hair-cloth.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And they cried to the Lord, the God of Israel, with one accord, that
                                    their children might not be made a prey, and their wives carried off, and their cities destroyed, and their holy things profaned,
                                    and that they might not be made a reproach to the Gentiles.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 Then Eliachim, the high priest of the Lord, went about all Israel,
                                    and spoke to them,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 Saying: Know ye that the Lord will hear your prayers, if you continue
                                    with perseverance in fastings and prayers, in the sight of the Lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 Remember Moses, the servant of the Lord, who overcame Amalec, that
                                    trusted in his own strength, and in his power, and in his army, and in his shields, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen,
                                    not by fighting with the sword, but by holy prayers:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 *So shall all the enemies of Israel be; if you persevere in this work

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 So they being moved by this exhortation of his, prayed to the Lord,
                                    and continued in the sight of the Lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 So that even they who offered the holocausts to the Lord, offered
                                    the sacrifices to the Lord, girded with hair-cloths, and with ashes upon their head.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And they all begged of God, with all their heart, that he would visit
