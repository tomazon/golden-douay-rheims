                           of our Lord Jesus.</I> From this, St. Chrysostom takes occasion to make several pathetic exhortations against swearing and
                           profaning this adorable name. What profit do you propose to yourselves by abusing this name? Is it to gain credit to your
                           discourse? So you will tell me; but, believe me, you are mistaken: if people saw you respected oaths, and were afraid to make
                           free with them, then they would believe you. Not when you give them to understand that you undervalue them, by your frequent
                           abuse of them. Break then so profane a custom. It will cost you neither money nor labour to do so: you are not required to
                           part with any gratification for this purpose. Use only at the beginning a little diligence, and you will easily overcome so
                           idle a practice. Wish, and it is done. (St. Chrysostom, super Act. sparsim.) (Haydock) --- <I>Whom you crucified.</I> St.
                           Peter, without fear or apprehension, openly and boldly tells them of their heinous crime: <I>that Christ is the head corner
                           </I>stone, which they <I>had rejected,</I> as Christ himself had told them, (Matthew xii. 10.) and that there <I>is no other

                           constancy of Peter and John,</I> surprised the council very much. They admired their knowledge of the Scriptures, seeing them
                           men without learning or letters,[2] and (as they are called <I>idiots</I>) they could not find how to contradict the fact,
                           <I>the man that was healed,</I> being there present. (Witham) --- Here, with the Jewish people, you may admire the constancy,
                           wisdom, and learning of the apostles, after the coming of the Holy Ghost, who, before that event, were simple, unlettered,

                           have seen and heard.</I> From these words, St. Chrysostom makes some important remarks on the conduct of Christians. On returning
                           from the theatre, or any public meeting, each can relate what he has seen and heard. This is the fruit they reap from attending
                           at public places of amusement; and would to God it were merely pleasure unmixed with poison. But on returning from Church,
                           where they have been for instruction, they remember nothing, speak of nothing they have seen or heard. All is silence. Not
                           even a thought is turned on what has been performed. (Hom. x. in Act.) --- It is a curious fact, which the apologists for
                           the innocence of modern plays would do well to attend to, that the theatre has always been avoided by the good and the virtuous
                           of every age. When one of the ancient Fathers was exorcising a female demoniac, who had been possessed at the theatre, and
                           bade the devil to depart; No, replied he, I had a right to take possession of her, for I found her in my own house. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           them.</I> Here commences the history of the first persecution of religious opinion, which the passions of men have continued,
                           and swelled to such a frightful length. But on this, as on all other occasions, it has defeated its own purpose, by adding
                           firmness and constancy to the persecuted. Truth is not to be overpowered by violence. In vain have the kings and princes of
                           the earth risen up against the Lord, and against his Christ. --- When will men learn, that charity is the principle of conversion!
                           --- <I>That</I> is an unheard-of kind of preaching, said the great Pope, St. Gregory, which exacts belief by stripes. He was
                           on this occasion reprehending the false zeal of certain indiscreet Christians at Rome, who were for compelling the Jews to
                           become converts. (Haydock) --- The amiable Fenelon, in a letter to Prince Charles, the son of our James the Second, says:
                           "No human power can force the impenetrable intrenchments of the human mind. Compulsion never persuades---it only makes hypocrites.
                           When kings interfere in matters of religion, they do not protect it; they enslave it. Give civil liberty to all; not by approving
                           all religions, as indifferent, but, by permitting in others, what God permits."</FONT></P><B>

                           --- Some take this to be the origin of a monastic life: but according to the Fathers, it is rather its progress and increase;
                           for it began in the family of Jesus Christ. The apostles, indeed, may be said to institute here that common life, which they
                           led under Christ, our Lord, and of which Peter speaks: <I>behold, we have left all.</I> This life, by St. Augustine and others,
                           is called <I>apostolic,</I> and there among <I>all,</I> wives are particularly specified. Cajetan thinks no vow was required:

                           the Sunamitess fell down and embraced Eliseus's feet. Many that asked favours of Christ, fell down at his feet, and Mary kissed
                           his feet. Such are signs of reverence paid both to Christ, and to other sacred persons, prophets, apostles, popes. See in
                           St. Jerome, how the people of Jerusalem flocked together to the venerable bishop Epiphanius, in Cyprus, presenting their children
                           for his blessing, kissing his feet, plucking the hem of his garment, so that he could not move for the throng. (St. Jerome,
