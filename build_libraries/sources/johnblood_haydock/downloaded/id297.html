                           apostle is ordered to measure the temple. Two prophets are promised, to teach mankind. They are put to death, and in three
                           days and a half after they are raised to life, and ascend to heaven. A great earthquake follows. The seventh Angel sounds
                           the trumpet. The elders give thanks to God. --- <I>Measure the temple,</I> &amp;c. This is to signify that the divine Providence
                           would always protect his faithful servants, who are called the temple of God; (1 Corinthians iii. 17. and 2 Corinthians vi.
                           16.) but by the <I>outward court</I> not to be measured, <I>because it is given to the Gentiles,</I> &amp;c. (ver. 2) is commonly
                           understood idolaters, infidels, heretics, who are not in the temple of God, nor in his Church. It is an allusion to the Jewish
                           temple, and the different divisions of it, the Gentiles not being permitted to enter into the temple itself, but only into
                           that outward part called the court of the Gentiles. (Witham) --- The churches consecrated to the true God, are so much diminished
                           in number, that they are represented by St. John as one church; its ministers officiate at <I>one altar;</I> and all the true
                           faithful are so few, with respect to the bulk of mankind, that the evangelist sees them assembled in one temple, to pay their
                           adorations to the Most High. (Pastorini)</FONT></P><B>

                           two witnesses....shall prophesy twelve hundred and sixty days.</I> It is a very common interpretation, that by these two witnesses
                           must be understood Henoch[Enoch] and Elias[Elijah], who are to come before the end of the world. It is true this is what we
                           read in several of the ancient Fathers, insomuch, that Dr. Wells, in his paraphrase, calls it the "consent of the primitive
                           fathers," and in his notes says, it is of "unexceptionable authority." This opinion (at least as to Elias) is grounded on
                           those words of the prophet Malachy, (Malachias iv. 5.) <I>behold, I will send you Elias, the prophet, before the coming of
                           the great and dreadful day of the Lord;</I> and also on the words of our Saviour, Christ, (Matthew xvii. 11.) where he tells
                           his disciples: <I>Elias indeed shall come, and restore all things.</I> But I cannot say that the consent of the fathers is
                           so unanimous as to Henoch: for we find by St. Hilary, that some thought Jeremy[Jeremiah] was to come with Elias, and he himself
                           thought that with Elias would come Moses. See his commentary on Matt., p. 710, Nov. edit. Secondly, allowing it a received
                           opinion that Henoch and Elias are again to come before the day of judgment, yet it is not the constant doctrine of the ancient
                           fathers, that by these <I>two witnesses</I> in this place of the Apocalypse, must be understood Henoch and Elias. St. Cyprian
                           expounds it of two sorts of martyrs for the Catholic faith; to wit, they who suffer death, and others who only suffered imprisonment,
                           loss of goods, and the like. Others expound it of the testimonies concerning Christ and his Church, of which some are in the
                           Old Testament, some in the New. To these we must join all those interpreters who expound all the visions and predictions in
                           the Apocalypse, till the 20th chapter, of the persecutions raised by the Jews: or by the heathens against the Church, which
                           have already happened. Of these, both as to ancient fathers and later interpreters, see Alcazar in his Prologomena, note 6,
                           p. 33, and note 12, p. 48. (Witham) --- <I>Two witnesses.</I> It is commonly understood of Henoch and Elias. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           do the like by Henoch[Enoch] and Elias, when they shall come. (Witham) --- In this and the following verse are expressed the
                           miraculous powers with which the two witnesses will be invested. These powers will be necessary to enable them to prove the
                           truth of their doctrine. Every messenger who appears with a commission from God, is always furnished with means to prove it.
                           Thus our Saviour and his apostles worked miracles in testimony of the Christian religion. And in the Old Testament, Elias
                           convicted the false prophets by a miracle. See 3 Kings xviii. Every new teacher consequently, who comes destitute of this
                           sanction, can claim no credit, but is only to be considered as an imposter. (Pastorini)</FONT></P><B>

                           of antichrist, when the blessed shall reign in heaven: but others expound this of the triumph of the Christian faith and Church,
                           when the providence of God putting an end to the persecutions against the Christian religion, by the miserable end of Dioclesian,

                           not&nbsp;<I><U>esothen</U>,</I> as in some manuscripts. --- Dr. Wells, when he tells us, on the third verse of this chapter,
                           that the <I>consent of the primitive Church</I> and <I>their unexceptionable authority,</I> require that by the <I>two witnesses</I>
                           we understand Henoch[Enoch] and Elias[Elijah], seems to be convinced of it by the authority (as he imagines) of Dr. Grabe.
                           This we find by his own words, (p. 79) "I shall hear," saith he, "adjoin a note of the late most learned and pious divine,
                           Dr. Grabe, in reference to this matter, in a passage of St. Irenæus, lib. v., chap. v. It is note 4, in p. 405, Oxon. Edit.
                           and runs thus in the doctor's own words: Disputationem de loco in quam Deus transtulerit et huc usque viventes conservarit
                           Enochum et Eliam Augustinus indicavit ad fidem non pertinere, at cum hic Irenæus doceat Apostolorum discipulos et (N. B.[<EM>Nota
                           Bene</EM>, Note Well?]) auditores dixisse, &amp;c. And the note in Dr. Wells ends with these words: Plures alios legendo notes
                           licet. After this Dr. W.[Wells] adds: I have taken the pains to transcribe all these citations, that the reader may see how
                           generally the Fathers do agree in this matter. And the same Dr. Wells a little after: Whereupon, saith he, the good doctor
                           (Grabe) adds in reference to himself: mihi parum tutum videtur aliter nunc sentire. And had all others the like due esteem
                           for the <I>Fathers,</I> and the like modest <I>opinion</I> of <I>themselves,</I> there would quickly be taken away that great
                           and unhappy difference of opinions, which is now in the Church, as to points of religion." I wish, no less than Dr. Wells,
                           that all others had the like due esteem of the Fathers, and the like modest opinion of themselves as the author of this note,
                           and he who writ, mihi parum tutum videtur aliter nunc sentire. By such dispositions of submission to the doctrine delivered
                           or witnessed by the consent of the primitive Fathers, might be quickly taken away the unhappy differences in points of religion
                           betwixt us, and all pretended reformers, who, by setting up their private judgment against the authority of the Catholic Church,
                           have brought in these differences. Luther led the way: I care not, said he, if a thousand Cyprians, a thousand Augustines,
                           are against me, &amp;c. But I am fully persuaded that Dr. W. did not know that all this Latin note, with the citations of
                           the Fathers, and with those words upon them, (mihi parum tutum videtur aliter nunc sentire) are not the words of the learned
                           and pious divine, Dr. Grabe, but are found word for word in the third note of Franciscus Feuardentius, in his Paris edition
                           of St. Irenæus, in the year 1576, p. 322, from whence they were taken above a hundred years after by Dr. Grabe. Had Dr. W.
                           taken notice that they were the words of so warm an adversary of the pretended reformation as Feuardentius, I doubt whether
                           he would have given such high commendations of the true author, with an N. B. on those words of Feuardentius, mihi parum tutum
                           videtur, &amp;c. But I am glad that Dr. Grabe and Dr. Wells are of the same judgment with the author of the note. </FONT></P></FONT><FONT
