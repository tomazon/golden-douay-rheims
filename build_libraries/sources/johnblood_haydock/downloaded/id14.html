                           King Herod the Great, surnamed Ascalonite, was a foreigner, but a proselyte to the Jewish religion. St. Jerome. --- This city
                           is called Bethlehem of Juda, to distinguish it from another Bethlehem, which was situated in the division of the tribe of
                           Zabulon. (Haydock) <I>Wise men.</I>[1] Both the Latin and Greek text may signify wise philosophers and astronomers, which
                           is the common exposition. The same word is also many times taken for a magician or soothsayer, as it is applied to Simon,
                           (Acts viii. 9,) and to Elymas, Acts xiii, ver. 6. and 8. Some ancient interpreters think these very men might have been magicians
                           before their conversion. See Cornelius a Lapide, &amp;c. --- <I>From the east.</I> Some say from Arabia, others from Chaldea,
                           others from Persia. Divers interpreters speak of them as if they had been kings, princes, or lords of some small territories.
                           See Baron. an. i. sect. 29. Tillemont, note 12. on Jesus Christ. The number of these wise men is uncertain. St. Leo, in his
                           sermons on the Epiphany, speaks of them as if they had been three, perhaps on account of their three-fold offerings. What
                           is mentioned in later writers as their names, is still of less authority, as Bollandus observed. There are also very different
                           opinions as to the time that the star appeared to these wise men, whether before Christ's birth, or about the very time he
                           was born, which seems more probable. The interpreters are again divided as to the year, and day of the year, when they arrived
                           at Bethlehem, and adored the Saviour of the world. Some think not till two years after Christ's birth. See St. Epiphanius
                           hær. xxx. num. 29. p. 134. And St. Jerome puts the massacre of the Holy Innocents about that time in his chronicle. But taking
                           it for granted that the wise men came to Jerusalem and to Bethlehem the same year that Christ was born, it is not certain
                           on what day of the year they adored him at Bethlehem. It is true the Latin Church, ever since the 4th or 5th age, has kept
                           the feast of the Epiphany on the 6th day of January. But when it is said in that day's office, <I>This day a star led the
                           wise men to the manger,</I> it may bear this sense only, this day we keep the remembrance of it; especially since we read
                           in a sermon of St. Maximus (appointed to be read in the Roman Breviary on the 5th day within the octave of the Epiphany) these
                           words: <I>What happened on this day, he knows that wrought it; whatever it was, we cannot doubt it was done in favour of us.</I>
                           The wise men, by the 11th verse, found Jesus at Bethlehem, where his blessed mother was to remain forty days, till the time
                           of her purification was expired. And it seems most probable that the wise men came to Bethlehem about that time, rather than
                           within thirteen days after Christ's birth: for had they come so soon after Christ was born, and been directed to go, and make
                           diligent inquiry at Bethlehem, which was not above five miles from Jerusalem, it can scarcely be imagined that so suspicious
                           and jealous a prince as Herod was, would have waited almost a month for their return without searching for the new-born king.
                           But it is likely, being again alarmed by what happened when Jesus was presented in the temple at his mother's purification,
                           he thereupon gave those cruel and barbarous orders for the massacre of those innocent infants. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           have seen his star.</I> They knew it to be <I>his star,</I> either by some prophecy among them, or by divine revelation. This
                           star was some lightsome body in the air, which at last seemed to point to them the very place where the world's Redeemer lay.
                           We know not whether it guided them during the whole course of their journey form the <I>East</I> to <I>Jerusalem</I>. We read
                           nothing more in the gospel, but that it appeared to <I>them in the East,</I> and that they saw it again, upon their leaving
                           Jerusalem to go to Bethlehem. (Witham) --- The wise men, in the Syrian tongue maguscha, are supposed to have come from Stony
                           Arabia, near the Euphrates. They might have preserved in this country the remembrance of the prophecy of Balaam, which had
                           announced the coming of the Messias by the emblem of a star, (Numbers xxiv. 17.) which was to arise from Jacob. The star which
                           appeared then, was the symbol of the star which Balaam had predicted. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           fear of losing his kingdom, he being a foreigner, and had obtained the sovereignty by violence. But why was all Jerusalem
                           to be alarmed at the news of a king so long and so ardently expected? 1. Because the people, well acquainted with the cruelty
                           of Herod, feared a more galling slavery. 2. Through apprehension of riots, and of a revolution, which could not be effected
                           without bloodshed, as the Romans had such strong hold. They had also been so worn down with perpetual wars, that the most
                           miserable servitude, with peace, was to the Jews an object rather of envy than deprecation. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           thou Bethlehem,</I> &amp;c. This was a clear prophecy concerning the Messias, foretold by Micheas; (chap. v. 2,) yet the words
                           which we read in the evangelist are not quite the same as we find in the prophet, either according to the Hebrew or to the
                           Greek text of the Septuagint. The chief difference is, that in the prophet we read: <I>And thou Bethlehem art little;</I>
                           but in the evangelist, <I>thou art not the least.</I> Some answer that the words of the prophet are to be expounded by way
                           of an interrogation, <I>art thou little?</I> It is certain the following words, both in the prophet and in the gospel, <I>out
                           of thee shall come forth a leader or a captain,</I> &amp;c. shew that the meaning is, <I>thou art not little.</I> St. Jerome's
                           observation seems to clear this point: he tells us, that the Jewish priests, who were consulted, gave Herod the sense, and
                           not the very words of the prophet; and the evangelist, as an historian, relates to us the words of these priests to Herod,
                           not the very words of the prophet. (Witham) --- The testimony of the chief priests proves that this text of Micheas was even
                           then generally applied to the Messias, and that to Him alone it must be referred according to the letter. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           going into the house.</I> Several of the Fathers in their homilies, represent the wise men adoring Jesus in the <I>stable,</I>
                           and in the <I>manger.</I> yet others, with St. Chrysostom take notice, that before their arrival, Jesus might be removed into
                           some little house in Bethlehem. --- Prostrating themselves, or <I>falling down, they adored him,</I> not with a civil worship
                           only, but enlightened by divine inspiration, they worshipped and adored him as their Saviour and their God. --- <I>Gold, frankincense,
                           and myrrh.</I>[2] Divers of the ancient Fathers take notice of the mystical signification of these offerings; that by <I>gold</I>
                           was signified the tribute they paid to him, as to their <I>king;</I> by <I>incense,</I> that he was <I>God;</I> and by <I>myrrh,</I>
                           (with which dead bodies used to be embalmed) that now he was also become a <I>mortal man.</I> See St. Ambrose lib. 2. in Luc.
                           chap. ii.; St. Gregory &amp;c. (Witham) --- The Church sings, "hodie stella Magos duxit ad præsepium," but it is not probable
                           that the blessed Virgin should remain so long in the open stable, and the less so, because the multitude, who hindered Joseph
                           from finding accommodations either among his relatives or in the public caravansaries, had returned to their own homes. (Estius)
                           --- <I>They adored Him.</I> Therefore, in the eucharist also, Christ is to be adored. For it is of no consequence under what
                           appearance he is pleased to give himself to us, whether that of a perfect man, a speechless child as here, or under the appearance
                           of bread and wine, provided it is evident that he is there; for in whatever manner or place he appears, he is true God, and
                           for that alone he is to be adored. Frivolous is the objection of certain sectarists, that Christ does not give himself to
                           us in the blessed eucharist to be adored, but to be eaten. For Christ was not in Bethlehem, nor did he descend from heaven
                           to be adored: He tells us in the xxth chap. of Matthew, ver. 28, <I>that the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but
                           to minister;</I> yet he was adored on earth, even while he was in his mortal state, by the magi, by his disciples, by the
                           blind man that was cured of his blindness, &amp;c. &amp;c. "Let us imitate the magi. Thou seest him not now in the crib, but
                           on the altar; not a woman holding him, but the priest present, and the Holy Ghost poured out abundantly upon the sacrifice."

                           is very probable that Joseph, with Jesus and his Mother, remained in some part of Egypt, where the Jews were settled, as at

                           and granted they might be literally spoken of the people Israel: yet as their captivity in Egypt was a figure of the slavery
                           of sin, under which all mankind groaned, and as their delivery by Moses was a figure of man's redemption by our Saviour Christ,
                           so these words in a mystical and spiritual sense apply to our Saviour, who in a more proper sense was the Son of God, than
                           was the people of Israel. (Witham) --- The application of this passage of the prophet to Christ, whereas in the simple letter

                           voice was heard in Rama.</I>[4] St. Jerome takes <I>Rama,</I> not for the name of any city, but for a <I>high place,</I> as
                           appears by his Latin translation. (Jeremias xxxi. 15.) But in all Greek copies here in St. Matthew, and in the Septuagint
                           in Jeremias, we find the word itself <I>Rama,</I> so that it must signify a particular city. Rachel, who was buried at Bethlehem,
                           is represented weeping (as it were in the person of those desolate mothers) the murder, and loss of so many children: and
                           Rama being a city not far from Bethlehem, in the tribe of Benjamin, built on a high place, it is said that the cries and lamentations
                           of these children, and their mothers, reached even to Rama. Cornelius a Lapide on Jeremias xxxi. thinks that these words were
                           not only applied by the evangelist in a figurative sense, but that the prophet in the literal sense foretold these lamentations.

                           shall be called a Nazarite,</I> or a <I>Nazarene.</I>[5] Jesus was called a <I>Nazarite,</I> from the place where he was bred
                           up in Galilee; and the Christians by the Jews were sometimes called <I>Nazarenes,</I> from Jesus of Nazareth. The evangelist
                           would shew that this name, which the Jews through contempt gave to Christ and his disciples, had an honourable signification:
                           and that this title was given in the predictions of the prophets to the Messias. But where, or in what prophet? For we find
                           not the words exactly in any of the prophets. To this St. Chrysostom answers, that St. Matthew took it from some prophetical
                           writings that have been lost. St. Jerome gives two other answers: first, that the word <I>Nazarene,</I> from the Hebrew <I>Nezer,</I>
                           signifies <I>separated,</I> and distinguished from others by virtue and sanctity: and so some that were particularly consecrated,
                           and devoted to the service of God, were called <I>Nazareans,</I> as Joseph, (Deuteronomy xxxiii. 16,) Sampson, (Judges xvi.
                           17,) &amp;c. Thus a Nazarene signifies one that is <I>holy:</I> and all the prophets, says St. Jerome, foretold that Christ
                           should be holy. Therefore also it was that St. Matthew did not cite any one prophet, but the prophets in general. The second
                           answer is, that a <I>Nazarean</I> (if derived from the Hebrew <I>Netser</I>) signifies a <I>flower,</I> or <I>bud;</I> and
                           so in the prophet Isaias, chap. xi. ver. 1) it is foretold of the Messias, that a <I>flower shall ascend from the root of
                           David.</I> (Witham) --- The reason why Jesus is called of <I>Nazareth,</I> and not of Bethlehem, is, because he was educated
                           there, and was generally supposed to have been born there. Hence he was called the Galilean; and the people argued from that
                           circumstance, that he was not the Messias, nor even a prophet, saying, <I>Can the Christ come from Galilee? Search the Scriptures,
                           and see that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not.</I> (John vii. 52.) Again, in Nazareth the word was made flesh, though in
                           Bethlehem he was produced to the world; and our Lord gives himself the same title, when he addressed Saul. <I>I am Jesus of
                           Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</I> (Acts xxii.) He remained at Nazareth till he was about 30 years of age. (Haydock)</FONT></P>
