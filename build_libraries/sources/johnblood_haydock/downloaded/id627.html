                           <i>Base-born.</i> Hebrew, "of two sons," or of obscure origin. (Cornelius a Lapide) --- His parents are no where specified,
                           as Arapha is not, as some pretend, the name of his mother, but denotes that he was of the race of the Raphaim, 2 Kings xxi.
                           16. Some translate, a man who challenges to fight a duel, or one who comes into the midst as "a champion," to decide the cause
                           of all the rest. Thus the Gaul defied the most valiant of the Romans, but was slain by M. Torquatus, Livy vii. Septuagint,
                           "A strong man went out from the station," &amp;c. Chaldean, "There came out from among them, out of the camp of the Philistines,
                           a man named Goliath." But many able interpreters adhere to the Vulgate. --- <i>Span,</i> about 12½ feet, so that he was taller
                           than two common men. Those who call in question the existence of giants, will surely have nothing to object to this formal
                           proof from Scripture. (Calmet) --- The Vatican Septuagint and Josephus read, however, "four cubits and a span," or near eight
                           feet. (Kennicott) --- Some reduce his height to 11 feet 3 inches, or even to 9 feet 9 inches, English. (Haydock) --- His helmet
                           weighed 15 pounds, avoirdupois; his collar, or buckler, about 30; the head of his spear (26 feet long) weighed about 38 pounds;
                           his sword 4; his greaves on his legs 30; and his coat of mail 156: total, 273 pounds. (Button.) (Haydock) --- Goliath wa a
                           figure of the devil, or of any arch-heretic, who provoketh the Church of God, but is slain by the humble with his own weapons.

                           <i>hamata.</i> --- <i>Brass,</i> which was used for the armour of the ancients. Plutarch (in Demetrio) speaks of a coat of
                           mail weighing forty pounds: the usual weight was twenty pounds. (Lipsius) --- The strength of the giant must have borne proportion
                           with his size. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           any proof. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Beam,</i> which was of a very different construction from ours. Hostius concludes, that all the armour of Goliath must
                           have weighed 272 pounds and 13 ounces, including the buckler and spear which his armour-bearer carried before him. Plutarch
                           allows a talent, or 60 pounds, for the usual weight of a soldier's armour. Alcimus was remarked in the army of Demetrius,
                           for having double that weight. --- <i>Bearer.</i> Hebrew, "one bearing a shield," or whose office it was to carry it, or any
                           other part of the armour, when required. It would appear singular that the giant should have two bucklers, though David seems
                           to specify two sorts, Psalm xxxiv. 2. This attendant might carry a large one, which would cover most part of the body, and
                           was of service when a person had not to remove far from his place in battle. The buckler of Ajax was like a tower, and consisted
                           of seven hides, covered with a plate of brass. (Homer, Iliad <i><u>Z</u></i>) (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Now,</i> &amp;c., to ver. 32. <i>And when,</i> is omitted in the Vatican Septuagint, which begins the latter verse thus,
                           "And David said," as the Alexandrian copy does now the 12th, which leads Kennicott to suspect that the intermediate verses
                           are an interpolation, formerly unknown to the Greek version. Houbigant includes these verses between crotchets, "that it may
                           be understood that these are not of the same author as the rest, and that the sacred writer may not be accused of making useless
                           repetitions." It has been observed in the last chapter, that David was the son of Isai, &amp;c. "If, says he, this be omitted,
                           there will be no vacuum in the context," as there is none in the Roman edition: (<b>11</b>) "they were greatly afraid. (<b>32.</b>)
                           And David said to Saul," &amp;c. As he had been appointed Saul's armour-bearer, it was very natural to suppose that he would
                           be near the king's person on such an occasion, rather than feeding sheep. We find also, that he had a <i>tent</i> of his own,
                           (ver. 54) which he could not have had, if he had only come to bring provisions to his brethren. The unaccountable conduct
                           of Eliab, the timidity of all Israel for forty days, &amp;c., will thus be avoided. Josephus is supposed to have given occasion
                           to this embellishment, though he takes no notice of many of those particulars which excite the surprise of Pilkington, Kennicott,
                           Aquila, &amp;c., and Origen received them from the Jews as genuine. A Hebrew Bible, (1661) with marginal criticisms, by a
                           Jew, includes these verses within parentheses, as interpolated, as well as from ver. 55 to chap. xviii. 6, observing that,
                           "the history consists at present of different and inconsistent accounts." The Syriac manuscript of Masius generally confirms
                           the Vatican Septuagint (Morin) so that we conclude, that these verses are there asterisked on the authority of Origen, as
                           not being in the original Greek, nor consequently in Hebrew. (ibid. p. 575.) --- <i>Mentioned.</i> Hebrew, "Juda, whose name....and
                           the man went among men, an old man in the days of Saul." We have already observed that the Alexandrian Septuagint seems to
                           promise a <i>speech,</i> but defers till ver. 32, thus, "And David said, the son of an Ephrathite. He was from," &amp;c. (Haydock)
                           --- <i>Men.</i> Chaldean, "He was an old man, whom they ranked among the young," as still vigorous. <i>Jam senior, sed cruda

                           Piscator, &amp;c.) The lower part of Jerusalem was already in the hands of the Israelites. He might place the armour for the

                           absence might produce a wonderful alteration, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- <i>Know not.</i> Literally, "if I know." The different
                           dress, in which David now appeared, gave rise to this ignorance. (Menochius) --- Abner was not surely affected with the same
                           malady as the king, who was obliged to ask David who was his father. But courtiers easily forget those from whom they have
                           no expectations. (Haydock) --- These strange proceedings make others conclude that this history is interpolated. (Kennicott)
