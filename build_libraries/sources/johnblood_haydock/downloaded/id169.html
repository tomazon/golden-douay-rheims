                           concerning those things.</I> It appears from this whole passage that the Corinthians had, in a former letter, consulted this
                           apostle, upon the subject of eating meats offered to idols. It was not unusual to reserve some part of the sacrifice of which
                           they made a supper, either in their own family, with their friends, or sometimes even in the temple. Some of the Christians
                           of Corinth attended without scruple at these sorts of feasts, and eat of the meats offered to idols; whilst others, on the
                           contrary, took scandal at this conduct, and thought it a tacit approbation of idolatry. St. Paul being consulted upon this
                           difficulty, gives them his advice in this chapter. (Calmet) --- <I>We know that we all have knowledge</I> about it. That is,
                           all we, who are sufficiently instructed, have knowledge enough to be convinced, that <I>idols are nothing</I> in themselves,
                           nor the meats offered to them better nor worse upon that account. (Witham) --- <I>Knowledge puffeth up,</I> &amp;c. Knowledge,
                           without charity and humility, serveth only to puff persons up. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           eternal Son and the Holy Ghost, though they are one and the same God with the Father. --- <I>And one Lord Jesus Christ: by
                           whom are all things, and we by him.</I> All things were created <I>by the Son</I> of God, the eternal and uncreated wisdom

                           of the three divine persons. The Arians and Socinians pretend from this place, that only the Father is truly and properly
                           God. The Catholics answer, that he is called the God, <I>of whom all,</I> because from him always proceeded, do proceed, and
                           shall always proceed the Son and the Holy Ghost, though one and the same God in nature, substance, &amp;c. And that when he
                           is called the <I>one God,</I> by these words are excluded the false gods of the heathens, not the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
                           who are but one God with the Father. St. Chrysostom also here observes, (hom. xx.) that if the two other persons are excluded,
                           because the Father is called <I>one God,</I> by the same way of reasoning it would follow, that because Jesus Christ is called
                           the <I>one Lord,</I> neither the Holy Ghost, nor even the Father, are the <I>one Lord,</I> whereas the Scriptures many times
                           express the divine majesty, as well by the word Lord as by the word God. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           knowledge is not in every one,</I> &amp;c. The new converts, who had been Jews, thought that things which had been offered
                           to idols were defiled, unclean, and could not be lawfully eaten: they who had been Gentiles looked upon them as victims offered
                           to idols, in which there was some virtue of enchantment, &amp;c. Their weak consciences judged they could not be lawfully
                           eaten: and when they were induced to eat them by the example of others, it was still against their consciences. The infidels
                           also might sometimes think that the Christians, in eating such things, honoured their idols; in such cases, they who were
                           better instructed, were to abstain, not to give offence to weak consciences, and lest they should make them sin. And a weak
