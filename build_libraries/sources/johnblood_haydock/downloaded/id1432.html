                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">4 But the King of kings stirred up the mind of Antiochus against the sinner,
                                    and upon Lysias suggesting that he was the cause of all the evils, he commanded (as the custom is with them) that he should
