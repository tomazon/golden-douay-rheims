                           Thus the apostles went rejoicing from before the council, because they had been thought worthy to suffer disgrace for the
                           name of Jesus. (Acts v.) And St. James (chap. i.) says: Think it the greatest joy when you fall into various temptations:
                           (i.e. tribulations) for these sufferings greatly serve to confirm the elect in the hopes which they have of enjoying the glory
                           of the world to come. (Estius)</FONT></P><B>

                           having prevented us with his gifts when we did not at all deserve them, having showered upon us the blessings of faith, charity,
                           patience, and fidelity, we cannot but have the greatest confidence that after this pledge and assurance of his good will towards
                           us, he well finish the work he has begun, and bring us to his heavenly kingdom. (Calmet) --- Not only the gift of the Holy
                           Spirit, but the Spirit himself, is given to us, who resides in our soul as in his own temple, who sanctifies it, and makes

                           <I>Why did Christ...die for the ungodly?</I> He shews Christ's great mercy and love for mankind, that he would die for us,
                           who were sinners, and consequently his enemies. How few are there that will lay down their lives for a <I>just man,</I> or
                           for a just cause? --- <I>Perhaps for a good man.</I> That is, for another, who has been good to him, his friend or benefactor,
                           we may find one that will expose or lay down his life. But Christ, in <I>due time,</I> appointed by the divine decree, died
                           for <I>sinners, for</I> us all. And if we have been reconciled to God, and justified by his death; now being made the children
                           of God, and his friends, we may with greater confidence hope to be saved. (Witham) --- The text of the Greek is as follows:
                           <I>For when we were weak, he gave us our Lord Jesus Christ to redeem us;</I> shewing how much God loved us, to perform such
                           stupendous acts of love in our behalf. But the reading of the Vulgate is conformable to St. Irenæus, (lib. iii. chap. 18.)
                           and to the commentaries of this epistle, which have been published under the name of St. Ambrose, and St. Jerome. (Calmet)
                           --- St. Augustine says, those whom the apostle first calls weak, he afterwards calls impious, hos dixit infirmos quos impios.
                           (Ep. lix. ad Paulinum.) --- St. Jerome, and other fathers and commentators, explain the Greek text of this verse as follows:
                           Scarcely would any one die for a just cause; for who would ever think of dying in defence of injustice? Others explain it
                           thus: Scarcely a single man would die for one that was wicked and unjust: for we can hardly find a person ready to lay down
                           his life for a good man; his friend and benefactor, who has been kind to him. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           heretics, as St. Augustine often brings them. Nor does St. Chrysostom deny original sin, though in this place he expounds
                           it that all by Adam's sin were made guilty of death and punishments. But how could they deserve these, had they not sinned

                           infected all mankind. (Witham) --- <I>Not imputed.</I> That is, men knew not, or made no account of sin; neither was it <I>imputed</I>
                           to them, in the manner it was afterwards, when they transgressed the known written law of God. (Challoner) --- All were conceived

                           born in sin: and besides this, all manner of actual sins, which men committed by their own perverse will, reigned every where
                           in the world. But before the law these sins were <I>not imputed,</I> that is, were not declared sins, that deserved such punishments

                           <I>But not as the offence, so also is the gift,</I> or the benefits which mankind receive by their Redeemer, Jesus Christ.
                           For St. Paul here shews that the graces which Christ came to bestow upon men, and offers to all, are much greater than the
                           evils which the sin of <I>one man,</I> Adam, caused. 1. Because, <I>if by the offence</I> of that one man, Adam, <I>many,</I>
                           i.e. <I>all died</I> by original sin that descended from Adam, (the blessed Virgin mother by a special privilege being always
                           excepted) <I>much more the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many,</I>[3] the comparison does not imply that
                           more in number receive the grace of Christ, than were infected with sin; but that they who receive the graces which are offered
                           to all, receive greater benefits than were the damages caused by the sin of Adam. <I>For the judgment indeed was by one unto
                           condemnation,</I> or so as to make all guilty of one sin, that is, of original sin; and for other actual sins, men committed
                           them by their own proper will; whereas the <I>grace of Christ</I> justifies men from <I>many sins;</I> that is, also from
                           all sins which they have committed by their own malice. 2. Because by <I>it,</I> that is, by the <I>offence of one man, death
                           reigned</I> in the world, and made all men liable to damnation; yet now by the incarnation of Christ, (which would not have
                           been, had not Adam sinned) all they who are justified by the grace of their Redeemer, have Christ God and man for their head:
                           he is become the head of that same mystical body which is his Church: they are exalted to the dignity of being the brothers
                           of Christ, the Son of God; they are made joint heirs with him of the kingdom of heaven, and so by the grace of Christ have
                           a greater dignity in this world, and shall be exalted to a greater and more eminent degree of glory in the kingdom of his
                           glory for all eternity; which hath given occasion to the Church, in her liturgy, to cry out, as it were with a transport of
                           joy, O happy fault, which hath procured us such and so great a Redeemer! See St. Chrysostom,[4] hom. x. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>Now the law entered in.</I> Not that the law was designed for <I>that end;</I> but the word <I>that,</I> as in many other
                           places, so here expresseth only the consequence that followed, when sinners occasionally became more guilty by the knowledge
                           of the law, and the precepts given. St. Chrysostom takes notice that it is not said the law was given, but only that it <I>entered
                           in,</I> as it were by the by, and only for a certain time, till our happy redemption, reconciliation, and justification by
                           Jesus Christ. (Witham) --- <I>That sin might abound.</I> Not as if the law were given purposely for sin to abound; but that
                           it so happened, through man's perversity, taking occasion of sinning more, from the prohibition of sin. (Challoner) --- <I>Where
                           sin abounded.</I> Grace abounded in the elect; for the apostle does not say that grace abounded in every place where <SPAN

                           grace hath abounded also. (Estius) --- The Jews and Gentiles having become sensible of their weakness and misery, the Almighty,
                           in his mercy, sent his only Son to enrich both the one and the other with his graces. The Gentiles were in the more deplorable
                           case, and received the greatest abundance of grace; as may be seen from the great number of conversions wrought amongst them
                           in so short a time in every part of the world. (Calmet) --- In the Greek it is&nbsp;<I><U>pareiselthe</U>,</I> entered in

                                    of one, many have died: much more the grace of God, and the gift in the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 Now the law entered in, that sin might abound. But where sin abounded,
