                           --- Achaz, Manasses, and Amon, had burnt (R. Solomon) as many copies as they could, (Haydock) but some zealous priests had
                           concealed this copy, in a box, in the wall of the temple, (Lyranus) or in the treasury adjoining it. The very hand writing
                           of Moses, containing the record of the covenant, (or the 28, 29, 30, and 31st chapters of Deuteronomy) which was placed in
                           (Calmet) or beside the ark, was now happily discovered. (Haydock) --- It seems it had been misplaced, as the ark itself had
                           been removed, 2 Paralipomenon xxiv. 14., and xxxv. 3. This venerable monument, and the dreadful menaces which it denounced,
                           made the deepest impression upon all, as we should read the autographs of St. Matthew, &amp;c., with far greater respect and
                           emotion than we do the printed copies. It is not at all probably that all the books of Scripture had been destroyed, as there
                           were always some religious souls in both kingdoms; and if some kings had already made the impious attempt, (Haydock) of which,
                           however, they are never accused in Scripture, they would not have been able to carry their malicious designs into effect.
                           Josias had, before his 18th year, made many excellent regulations, conformably to the law, which was well understood, and
                           carefully preserved by the priests and prophets, (Calmet) 2 Paralipomenon xvii. 9. --- <i>Read it.</i> Scribes were generally
                           chosen from among the Levites. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           had began to prophesy five years before. But he probably resided at Anathoth. Sophonias appeared, perhaps, only towards the

                           inclosed Jerusalem with a second wall, (2 Paralipomenon xxxiii. 14.; Calmet) unless this was done by his father, 2 Paralipomenon
                           xxxii. 5. (Tirinus) --- Here Holda is said to have kept a school. (Calmet) --- Chaldean, "the house of doctrine," a place
                           next in importance to the temple. (Vatable) --- St. Jerome speaks of this <i>Second,</i> as of a gate, or part of Jerusalem,
                           between the inner and the outer wall. (Contra Pelag, 2 Irad. in 2 Par. and in Sophon. i. 10.) (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           in battle, chap. xxiii. 29. (Calmet) --- Instead of peace, the Alexandrian Septuagint reads, "in Jerusalem," to which city
                           Josias was brought from Mageddo, where he had perhaps rashly attacked the king of Egypt, with whom he had not been engaged
                           in war. (Haydock) --- This last good king was given to Juda, that he people might not pretend that they were forced to embrace
