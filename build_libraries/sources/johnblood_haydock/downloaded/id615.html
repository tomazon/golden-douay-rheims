                           <i>Azotus,</i> one of the five principal cities of the Philistines. It is astonishing that God permits these infidels to touch
                           the ark, He who resented the conduct of Oza, and of the Bethsamites, with such severity. But the law regarded the Israelites,
                           and the pagans were ignorant of it. (Calmet) --- The servant, who knows his master will, and does not obey, shall suffer many
                           stripes; [Luke xii. 47.] and those who have the happiness of professing the true religion, and dishonour it by their immorality,
                           must expect to feel the heavy hand of the judge, much more than ignorant unbelievers. (Haydock) --- The Philistines could
                           not suppose that they had gained a victory over God, since they knew he might be displeased with the conduct of his people;
                           and they soon began to perceive that they had brought the greatest misfortunes upon themselves.</font></p><b>

                           as far as the waist, and a fish below. (Haydock) (Judges xvi. 23.) --- The ark was placed near the idol, out of respect; (Calmet)
                           or as a trophy of the victory, which they attributed to Dagon. (Menochius) --- Thus they hung up the arms of Saul in the temple
                           of Asteroth; (chap. xxxi. 10,) and David placed the sword of Goliah in the tabernacle.</font></p><b>

                           was left on its pedestal. --- <i>Day.</i> The Philistines themselves established this custom, which was a tacit confession
                           of the imbecility of the idol, which they nevertheless continued to adore. The prophet Sophonias, (i. 9,) is supposed to accuse
                           the Jews of imitating this superstition. The ancient Christians, out of respect, kissed the thresholds of the churches of
                           the apostles and martyrs. (Prudentius in S. Romano.) --- The Persians still refrain from treading on those of certain mosques,
                           which are covered with silver. (Tavernier i. 5.)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Emerods.</i> The particular disorder which attacked them, (Psalm lxxvii. 66,) is very uncertain. Some say it was the dysentery,
                           or the fistula, or the venereal disease, &amp;c. Eusebius believes that it was in punishment of their incontinency. It was
                           very painful, and sometimes proved mortal, ver. 12. Aristophanes assures us that the Athenians were punished with a shameful
                           disorder, because they had not received the mysteries of Bacchus with due respect; and they were ordered, by the oracle, to
                           make and carry aloft some obscene figures, before they could obtain a cure. (Acharn. ii. 6.) --- <i>And in,</i> &amp;c. The
                           remainder of this verse is not found in Hebrew, Chaldean, Syriac, Arabic, &amp;c., nor in many Greek and Latin copies. But
                           it is conformable to the truth of history, since we read that figures of these animals were placed beside the ark, in memory
                           of this event, chap. vi. 6. --- <i>Mice,</i> or rats. Such vermin have often obliged people to abandon their country. (Pliny,
                           [Natural History?] viii. 28.) --- Bellon. (ii. 78,) testifies that he saw, near Gaza, such multitudes, as to depopulate whole
                           fields; and, if Providence had not caused the birds, called boudres, to destroy them, the people could have had no harvest.</font></p><b>

                           they answered, let the ark....be carried unto Geth," in which sense the Septuagint seem to have taken it. But the Vulgate
                           is more natural. Theodoret (q. 10,) concludes, that the people imagined the mortality proceeded from some natural cause; (Calmet)
                           otherwise it would have been very absurd to give such advice, as the ark would spread the contagion throughout the country,
                           by being removed. From Geth it was sent to Accaron, when the magistrates of the city objected to its being admitted, ver.
                           10. Jospehus says, however, that it visited all the five principal cities, as if to punish them for their impiety. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                                    lying upon his face on the earth before the ark of the Lord: and the head of Dagon, and both the palms of his hands, were

                                    them,* and afflicted Azotus and the coasts thereof with emerods. And in the villages and fields in the midst of that country,
                                    there came forth a multitude of mice, and there was the confusion of a great mortality in the city.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And sending, they gathered together all the lords of the Philistines
                                    to them, and said: What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And the Gethites answered: Let the ark of the God of

                                    in their secret parts. And the Gethites consulted together, and made themselves seats of skins.</font></p>
