                           his disciples being hungry.</I> How truly admirable is the conduct of the apostles, who would not depart from the company
                           of Jesus, though pressed by the greatest hunger and fatigue, not even to take a little refreshment for the body. (St. Chrysostom)
                           --- It is remarked by St. Jerome, that the Pharisees did not accuse the disciples of theft, but of a breach of the sabbath.
                           St. Luke calls this sabbath, <I>Sabbatum secundo primum,</I> which is differently explained by interpreters. Ribeira, following
                           St. Chrysostom and Theophilactus, thinks that every sabbath was so called, which followed immediately any feast. Maldonatus
                           is of opinion that some particular sabbath is pointed out by this name, and conjectures that it was the sabbath of Pentecost,
                           because it is the second of the great feasts, viz. the Passover, Pentecost, Scenopegia, or of the Tabernacles. --- In the
                           Greek, <EM>sabbath</EM> is in the plural, and means the days of the sabbath or rest, which were a part of the feast. The three
                           great feasts lasted a whole week each. They were all three called&nbsp;<I><U>prota</U>,</I> i.e. great, solemn feasts. The
                           first was that of the Passover, with the seven days of unleavened bread, called&nbsp;<I><U>protoproton</U>,</I> the first-first
                           sabbath by excellence: the second was the great feast of Pentecost,&nbsp;<I><U>deteroproton</U>,</I> the second-first sabbath,
                           (which seems to have been the feast meant by the evangelist in this place, as at this season the corn was ripe in Palestine)
                           and the third was the feast of tabernacles,&nbsp;<I><U>tritoproton</U>,</I> the third-first great sabbath. Many, however,
                           are of&nbsp;opinion, that by the second-first sabbath is meant the octave day of the feast, which was ordered to be equally
                           solemnized with the first day of the feast. (Leviticus xxiii. 36, 39. and Numbers xxix. 35.)</FONT></P><B>

                           which is not lawful to do on the sabbath-days.</I> The Pharisees blame not the disciples for plucking the ears of corn, as
                           they passed by, (this being allowed, Deuteronomy xxiii. 25.) but for doing it on a sabbath-day, as if it had been a breach
                           of the sabbath. (Witham) --- <I>Behold,</I> &amp;c. The Pharisees here mildly rebuked our Lord; but afterwards, when he restored
                           the withered hand, they rose up against him with such rage, that they formed upon the spot designs of killing him, as in ver.
                           14. When there is nothing great or sublime, they are more quiet, but when with his word only he restores health to the infirm,
                           like furious beasts, they grow enraged. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xl.)</FONT></P><B>

                           to prove from 2 Kings viii. 19, and 1 Paralipomenon xxiv. 3. Others say that Abiathar, son of Achimelec, was present, and
                           sanctioned the action of his father, thus making it his own. Others again contend, that it ought to have been translated,

                           is to be preferred to the observation of the sabbath. (Menochius) --- In the concurrence of two incompatible precepts, we
                           must give the preference to that which is the end and object of the other; thus we must prefer the preservation of life to
                           the observance of the sabbath. (Haydock) --- These loaves were twelve, corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel. They
                           were set six and six, one upon another, at each end of the table. Upon the uppermost loaf of each heap stood a vessel, smoking
                           with the sweetest incense. These loaves at the week's end were, according to God's order, eaten by the priests only, when
                           they were replaced by twelve fresh ones, made like them, with the finest flour, tempered with oil. This offering of the <I>shew-bread

                           --- By this question they did not seek learning or improvement, but merely an occasion to ensnare Jesus in his words. If he
                           answered in the affirmative, they would accuse him of violating the repose of the sabbath, enjoined by the law of Moses; if
                           in the negative, of cruelty and want of feeling, and would infallibly have objected his own practice against him, as he had
                           before justified his disciples for plucking corn on the sabbath. Jesus seeing their malice, avoids their captious question
                           by proposing one to them, as we read in St. Mark. <I>Is it</I> lawful to do good or ill on the sabbath? As if he had said,
                           whether is it better to assist your neighbor on the sabbath, or to abandon him in his distress, when you are able to afford
                           him relief? Unable to give an answer, that would not be a justification of his actions, they remain silent; but he still presses
                           the subject, by retorting their own actions upon themselves. They afforded relief to brute animals that stood in need of it
                           on the sabbath. It was therefore cruelty, or mere malice, to cavil at his relieving the sick man on the sabbath. (Jansenius)</FONT></P><B>

                           (according to St. Mark) he ordered him to stretch out his hand, that by these several ways, he might excite the pity of the
                           stiff-necked people; but no sooner had he performed this act of charity, than they, swelling with anger, went out, meditating
                           destruction. So ruinous and pestiferous is the vice of envy! (St. Chrysostom, hom. xli). --- St. Matthew having mentioned
                           this miracle, takes occasion to narrate others which Christ performed on his second return from Judea. We have frequently
                           to mention that the particle <I>tunc, then,</I> and such like, do not always relate to what immediately goes before. A soul
                           in sin may be said to resemble the withered hand, but obedience with faith to God's commands can and will restore it to its

                           these words in conformity with their interpretation of the two foregoing verses, as follows: "The Lord will cherish and support
                           the infirm and weak in this time of penance and probation, inviting them to greater strength, and light, and perfect charity,
                           till the power of death be taken away, till he return to judge the world, when his judgment shall be victorious; though, in
                           the mean while, it often may appear suppressed, and even subdued by the obstinate will of man." But the exposition, most conformable
                           to the literal sense of the prophet, is: he will support the weak by his mildness, until it come to pass that his judgment,
                           which he came to announce to the Gentiles, be led to victory, by his truth becoming universally triumphant over the world,
                           and in his name all nations shall hope. (Jansenius). --- Thus will he bear with the little light and virtue of his enemies,

                           to similar divisions. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xlii). --- The Pharisees, on a former occasion, had laid a similar accusation
                           against him. Then indeed he did not correct them, wishing them to discover his virtue from the miracles he performed, and
                           the dignity of his character from the doctrines he delivered; but as they still continue the old accusation, he now wishes
                           to convince them of their error. Envy does not so much seek <I>how</I> to speak, as <I>what</I> to speak. Yet Christ does
                           not despise them, but answers them in the most meek and humble manner, teaching us to be charitable to our enemies, though
                           they behave to us in the most inimical manner. By this also, our divine Saviour evidently demonstrates the falsity of the
                           accusation; for it is never in the power of a possessed person to know another's thoughts, nor give so mild an answer. And
                           as his enemies did not dare, from fear of the people, openly to broach this base calumny, seeing their thoughts, he answered
                           them; still he does not expose to public infamy the malice of their hearts, but gives them a private solution of their difficulty.

                           blasphemy</I>[2]<I> against the Spirit,</I> or against the Spirit and the Holy Ghost. St. Augustine takes notice, that this
                           is one of the most difficult places in the Scriptures. According to the common exposition, here is not meant a sin committed
                           by speaking against the third person of the blessed Trinity, the Holy Ghost, but that sin by which the obstinate Jews wilfully
                           opposed Christ, and attributed those miracles to Beelzebub, which he performed by the Spirit of God, of which they could not
                           be ignorant, but by a wilful blindness. (Witham) --- The sin here spoken of is that blasphemy, by which the Pharisees attributed
                           the miracles of Christ, wrought by the Spirit of God, to <I>Beelzebub,</I> the prince of devils. Now this kind of sin is usually
                           accompanied with so much obstinacy, and such wilful opposing the Spirit of God, and the known truth, that men who are guilty
                           of it are seldom or ever converted; and therefore are never forgiven, because they will not repent. Otherwise there is no
                           sin which God cannot, or will not forgive to such as sincerely repent, and have recourse to the keys of the Church. (Challoner)

                           and therefore despiseth the bounteous mercies of God, in so mighty a work, if he continue in his obstinate mind till death,
                           he is guilty of sin against the Holy Ghost. (Enchir. lxxxiii. ep. 50. in fine.)</FONT></P><B>

                           &amp;c. It was their duty to have a knowledge of the Holy Ghost, and they obstinately refused to admit what was clear and
                           manifest. Though they were ignorant of the divinity of Jesus Christ, and might take him to be merely the son of a poor artizan,
                           they could not be ignorant that the expelling of demons, and miraculous healing of all diseases, were the works of the Holy
                           Ghost. If, therefore, they refused to do penance for the insult offered to the Spirit of God, in the person of Christ, they
                           could not hope to escape condign punishment. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xlii). --- <I>Against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven
                           him;</I> i.e. they who for want of sufficient instruction, were invincibly ignorant that Christ was God, might more easily
                           be brought to the true knowledge and faith of Christ, and so receive forgiveness of their sins: but if <I>he shall speak against
                           the Holy Ghost,</I> i.e. against the Spirit of God in Christ, and shall oppose the known truth, by attributing to the devil
                           that doctrine, and those miracles, which evidently were from the Spirit and the hand of God, that sin shall never be forgiven
                           him. But how is this consistent with the Catholic doctrine and belief, that there is no sin any man commits of which he may
                           not obtain pardon in this life? To this I answer, that in what manner soever we expound this place, it is an undoubted point
                           of Christian faith, that there is no sin which our merciful God is not ready to pardon; no sin, for the remission of which,
                           God hath not left a power in his Church, as it is clearly proved by those words, <I>Whose sins you shall forgive, they are
                           forgiven them,</I> &amp;c. St. Chrysostom therefore expounds these words, <I>shall not be forgiven them,</I> to imply no more,
                           than shall scarcely, or seldom be forgiven; that is, it is very hard for such sinners to return to God, by a true and sincere
                           repentance and conversion; so that this sentence is like to that (Matthew xix. 26.) where Christ seems to call it an impossible
                           thing for a rich man to be saved. In the same place St. Chrysostom tells us, that some of those who had blasphemed against
                           the Holy Ghost, repented, and had their sins forgiven them. St. Augustine, by this blasphemy against the Spirit, understands
                           the sin of <I>final impenitence,</I> by which an obstinate sinner refuseth to be converted, and therefore lives and dies hardened
                           in his sins. (Witham) --- <I>Nor in the world to come.</I> From these words St. Augustine (De Civ. lib. xxi. chap. 13.) and
                           St. Gregory (Dial. iv, chap. 39.) gather, that some sins may be remitted in the world to come; and consequently that there
                           is a purgatory, or a middle place. (Challoner) --- St. Augustine says these words would not be true, if some sins were not
                           forgiven in the world to come; and St. Gregory says, we are to believe from these words in the existence of the fire of purgatory,
                           to expiate our smaller offences, before the day of judgment. St. Isidore and Ven. Bede say the same. St. Bernard, speaking
                           of heretics, says, they do not believe in purgatory: let them then inquire of our Saviour, what he meant by these words. ---
                           It is well known that Ven. Bede, on his death-bed, bestowed several small tokens to the monks who were present, that they
                           might remember to pray for his soul in the holy sacrifice of the mass. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           ver. 1) Esther, after part of three days, went to the king. --- <I>In the heart of the earth:</I> by which is signified, Christ's
                           descent into hell; as St. Paul says (Ephesians iv. 9.) that he descended into the <I>inferior parts of the earth,</I> and
                           this cannot be understood of the grave only. (Witham) --- Jesus Christ expired on the cross about the ninth hour, or 3 p.m.
                           when the general and supernatural darkness that covered the earth, may be counted for the first night, and the light which
                           again appeared, for the term of the first day. (Bible de Vence) --- As Jonas was a sign to the Ninivites, so is Christ to
                           the Jews; for as he by the prodigy of remaining so long in the fish's belly, and afterwards coming forth alive, gave such
                           authority to his preaching, that the Ninivites were converted; so Christ, by his death and resurrection on the third day,
                           shall shew that he is the true Christ, and this generation shall acknowledge him for the Messias. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>
