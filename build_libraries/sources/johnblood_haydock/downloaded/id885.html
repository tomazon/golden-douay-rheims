                           that is, "during the night," 2 Paralipomenon vii. 12. God had spoken to Solomon, by a prophet, while he was building the temple;

                           place in the night, after Solomon had poured forth his most solemn prayer. (Calmet) --- Others think that God deferred answering
                           his petition for thirteen years, till Solomon was on the point of falling off from the observance of piety, that so he might
                           be restrained more effectually. (Salien, the year before Christ 1011.) --- Fire from heaven had sufficiently signified that
                           his former request had been granted. (Menochius) --- The context shews that the admonition was not sent till the palace was
                           finished, (ver. 1, and 10.) in the 23rd year of Solomon. (Salien)</FONT></P><B>

                           them up to rebellion, chap. xi. 27. Mello was a palace, fortification, (Calmet) or bridge, erected in the vale, (Salien) from
                           the palace to the temple, (Menochius) lying between Sion and the old Jerusalem. David had begun to build here, and Solomon
                           perfected the works. Ezechias repaired the wall, 2 Paralipomenon xxxii. 5. In this palace Joas was slain, 4 Kings xii. 20.
