                           wished myself to be an anathema from Christ.</I>[1] The word <I>anathema,</I> according to its derivation, signifies a thing
                           separated or laid apart for some particular use. Hence it was put to signify things given and consecrated to God, which therefore
                           used to be presented and hung up in temples. 2. The word also was applied to signify things whose <SPAN lang=EN>destruction
                           was resolved upon, that is, men or things separated for destruction</SPAN>, as sometimes, men deputed to be sacrificed to
                           the gods to appease their anger. This signification was according to the Hebrew word <I>cherem,</I> and the Syriac word <I>horma,</I>
                           as Numbers xxi. 3. He called the name of that place <I>Horma,</I> that is, <I>anathema;</I> because it was to be entirely
                           destroyed. See 1 Machabees v. Hence <I>anathema</I> was also used for a <I>curse,</I> and to <I>anathematize,</I> to curse.
                           See Acts xxiii. 14. The sense of this place is differently expounded. Tolet, by the word <I>I wished,</I> or <I>I did wish,</I>
                           thinks that St. Paul might speak of the time before his conversion, when out of a false zeal, he wished to be separated from
                           Christ, and from all Christians: and that he brings this to shew his brethren how zealous he had been for their religion.
                           But this wish of St. Paul is generally expounded as proceeding from the great love and charity he had, when he was an apostle,
                           for the conversion and salvation of his brethren, the Jews, who mostly remained obstinate and incredulous: and some will have
                           it to be no more than a hyperbolical expression of his great love and affection for them. Others, with St. Jerome, ep. ad
                           Algasiam, tom. iv. p. 203. Ed. Ben. think that by this way of speaking, St. Paul signifies himself willing to be sacrificed,
                           by undergoing any death for their conversion: but St. Chrysostom (hom. xvi.) thinks this far short of the sublime charity
                           of St. Paul; for by such a death, says he, he would not be separated <I>from</I> Christ, but would be a great gainer by it;
                           since by that means he would soon be free from all the troubles and sufferings of a miserable life, and blessed with the company
                           and enjoyment of Christ in the kingdom of his glory. He, and many others, think that St. Paul was so troubled and grieved
                           to the heart at the obstinacy of the unbelieving Jews, at their blasphemies against Christ, and their eternal perdition, that
                           an extraordinary charity and zeal for God's honour, and their salvation, made him wish even to endure a separation from Christ,
                           and from the glory prepared for him in heaven, though not from the love, or from the grace of Christ. If this, says St. Chrysostom,
                           seems incredible to us, it is because we are far from such heroic dispositions of the love of God, and of our neighbours.
                           (Witham) --- The apostle's concern and love for his countrymen, the Jews, was so great, that he was willing even to suffer
                           an <I>anathema,</I> or curse, for their sake; or any evil that could come upon him, without his offending God. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           done to his people, the Jews. As, 1. That God had adopted them for his elect people. 2. That he had glorified them with so
                           many miracles. 3. That he had made a particular <I>covenant</I> and alliance with them. 4. Given them a written law. 5. Prescribed

                           Though the apostles did not often, in express words, call Jesus Christ <I>the God,</I> lest the heathens, when they were not
                           sufficiently instructed, should imagine that there were many gods, (as divers of the fathers take notice) yet here, and in
                           several places, they clearly delivered the divinity of our Saviour, Christ. The Socinians might here observe, that the apostle
                           calls him the God blessed for ever, and with the Greek article. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           promises were made to them only, and to those that were of their race, and that the Gentiles were not to partake of them.
                           St. Paul shews them their mistake, by telling them who are to be esteemed the true children of Abraham, and of the patriarchs,
                           according to the promises which God made, and who are not. (Witham) --- <I>All are not Israelites,</I> &amp;c. Not all, who
                           are the carnal seed of <I>Israel,</I> are true <I>Israelites</I> in God's account: who, as by his free grace he heretofore
                           preferred Isaac before Ismael, and Jacob before Esau, so he could, and did by the like free grace, election, and mercy, raise
                           up spiritual children by faith to Abraham and Israel, from among the Gentiles, and prefer them before the carnal Jews. (Challoner)
                           --- <I>Neither are all they, who are of the seed of Abraham,</I> his true spiritual children, to whom these promises were
                           made: <I>nor are</I> all they who are descended from Isaac the children of these promises nor are <I>all they </I>true <I>Israelites,</I>
                           to whom these blessings were promised, although they are descended <I>from Israel;</I> but only they who are the children
                           of the patriarchs by faith in Jesus, the Messias, in whom God promised that he would bless all nations. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           that the children of Abraham are the children of the promise, he adduces the passage of Scripture: "I will come in a year's
                           time, and Sara shall have a son." (Genesis xviii.) This promised child was Isaac, the true son of the promise of God, and
                           of the faith of Abraham; and not the son of the flesh, for Ismael was this as well as Isaac; but he was granted to the prayers
                           of Abraham, a child of the grace and mercy of God. All the faithful, therefore, of whatever race or nation they may be, are
                           in this sense the children of Abraham, by being gratuitously chosen by God, and by the fidelity in which they are imitators
                           of Abraham. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>And not only she </I>(Sara) brought forth Isaac, who was the only child of Abraham, to whom the promises descended, though
                           he was the father of Ismael, by Agar, and of all the Ismaelites. And lest the Jews should say that the Ismaelites, though
                           descending from Abraham, according to the flesh, were not to be reputed as his children for another reason, because they came
                           of Agar, who was only the handmaid of Sara; he brings them another example to which they could make no such reply; to wit,
                           that <I>Rebecca</I> also at once had two sons of Isaac, <I>Esau</I> and <I>Jacob;</I> where, though Esau was the first-born,
                           these promises were not reputed as made to him, and his descendants, the Idumeans, who were equally the descendants of Isaac,
                           yet not the favourite people, nor the children of God, as the Jews saw very well. (Witham) --- <I>Not yet born.</I> By this
                           example of these twins, and the preference of the younger to the elder, the drift of the apostle is, to shew that God, in
                           his election, mercy, and grace, is not tied to any particular nation, as the Jews imagined, nor to any prerogative of birth,
                           or any foregoing merits. For as, antecedently, to his grace, he sees no merit in any, but finds all involved in sin, in the
                           common mass of condemnation; and all children of wrath; there is no one whom he might not justly leave in that mass; so that
                           whomsoever he delivers from it, he delivers in his mercy: and whomsoever he leaves in it, he leaves in his justice. As when,
                           of two equally criminal, the king is pleased out of pure mercy to pardon one, whilst he suffers justice to take place in the
                           execution of the other. (Challoner) --- <I>Nor had done any good or evil.</I> God was pleased to prefer, and promise his blessings
                           to the younger of them, Jacob, declaring <EM>that the elder shall serve the younger;</EM> that is, that the seed of the elder
                           should be subject to that of the younger, as it happened afterwards to the Idumeans. And the prophet, Malachias, said of them,
                           <I>I have loved Jacob, but hated Esau, and turned his mountains into a desert,</I> &amp;c. --- <I>That the purpose of God,</I>
                           his will, and his decree, (see the foregoing chap. ver. 28.) <I>might stand according to election,</I> might be, not according
                           to any works they had done, or that he foresaw they would do, but merely according to his mercy. And though the preference
                           which God gave to Jacob was literally true, as to temporal benefits; yet St. Augustine observes in divers places, that Jacob
                           was a figure of the elect or predestinate, and Esau of the reprobate; and that as Jacob and his posterity was more favoured,
                           purely by the mercy of God, without any merits on their side; so are God's elect, whom he has called, and to whom, according
                           to his eternal purpose, he decreed to give eternal glory, and special graces to bring them thither. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           he shews mercy to some, it is an effect of his goodness and liberality only which they do not deserve. If he leaves others
                           in their sins, they are only punished according to their deserts. His mercy shines upon his elect; and his divine justice
                           is displayed against the wicked and the reprobate, but only according to what they have deserved. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           to the elect; now he shews that God cannot be accounted unjust for leaving the reprobate in their sins, or for punishing them
                           as they deserve; for this purpose he brings the example of Pharao, who remained hardened against all the admonitions and chastisements

                           <I>Thou wilt say, therefore, to me,</I> &amp;c. The apostle makes objection, that if God call some, and harden, or even permit

                           that men are not converted? St. Paul first puts such rash and profane men in mind, that is unreasonable and impertinent for
                           creatures to murmur and dispute against God their Creator, when they do not comprehend the ways of his providence. --- <I>O
                           man,</I> [4]<I> who art thou that repliest against God?</I> This might stop the mouths, and quiet the minds of every man,
                           when he cannot comprehend the mysteries of predestination, of God's foreknowledge, his decrees and graces, or the manner of
                           reconciling them with human liberty. He may cry out with St. Paul again, (chap. xi. 33.) <I>O the riches of the wisdom, and
                           of the knowledge of God! how incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his ways!</I> --- <I>Shall the thing
                           formed,</I> &amp;c. <I>Hath not the potter power,</I> &amp;c.[5] To teach men that they ought not to complain against God
                           and his providence, when they cannot comprehend his works, he puts them in mind of their origin. Every one may say to God,
                           with the prophet Isaias, (vi. 48.) <I>Lord, thou art our Father, and we are but clay; thou art our Maker who framed us, and
                           we are all of us the work of thy hands.</I> Hath not the potter power as he pleaseth, out of the same lump of clay to make
                           some vessels for honourable uses, and some for less honourable. St. Chrysostom observes very well, that this comparison must
                           not be extended further than the apostle designed; which was to teach us, how submissive we ought to be to God, in what we
                           do not understand; but we must not pretend from hence, nor from any expression in this chapter, as divers heretics have done,
                           that as vessels of clay are destitute of free will and liberty, so are men. This is against the doctrine of the Catholic Church,
                           and against the Scriptures, in many places. (Witham) --- <I>The potter.</I> This similitude is used, only to shew that we
                           are not to dispute with our Maker: nor to reason with him why he does not give as much grace to one as to another: for since
                           the whole lump of our clay is vitiated by sin, it is owing to his goodness and mercy that he makes out of it so many vessels
                           of honour; and it is no more than just that others, in punishment of their unrepented sins, should be given up to be vessels
                           of dishonour. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>And if God,</I> &amp;c. He now gives the reason why God might, without any injustice, have mercy on some, and not on others;
                           grant particular graces and favours to his elect, and not equally to all; because all mankind was become liable to damnation
                           by original sin: the clay that all are made of, is a sinful clay; and as St. Augustine says, was become a lump and mass of

                           <I>Whom also he hath called,</I> &amp;c. That is, he hath called some <I>of the Jews,</I> and many <I>of the Gentiles,</I>
                           to be vessels of election, as he foretold by his prophet Osee, (ii. 24.) <I>I will call them my people, that were not my people,...</I>and

                           numerous nation of the Jews, only <I>a remnant shall be saved,</I> by their obstinacy in not receiving, and refusing to believe
                           in, their Messias. For <I>finishing his word, and reducing it by his justice to a little, because the Lord will bring to pass
                           his word reducing it to a small compass upon the earth.</I> The sense and construction of this verse is equally obscure in
                           the Greek and in the Latin text: the true sense seems to be, that <I>finishing his word,</I> or fulfilling his promises to
                           Israel, those that are to be saved, will be <I>reduced</I> by his justice for their sins, to <I>a few;</I> because, though
                           <I>he bring to pass his word,</I> and his promises, the saved among the Israelites will be reduced to a small compass, in
                           comparison of the great number of the Gentiles. This exposition agrees with the rest of the text, and with what follows, and
                           was foretold <I>by Isaias,</I> (chap. i. 9.) that <I>unless the God of Sabaoth</I> (of hosts) had, through his mercy, <I>left</I>
                           them <I>a seed,</I> a small number, they would all in a manner have deserved to be utterly destroyed, like Sodom and Gomorrha.
                           (Witham) --- What I say, shall come to pass, that in those places, viz. Greece, Italy, &amp;c. where those who are strangers
                           to the worship of the true God dwell, and have been called, on account of their profane worship, <I>not my people.</I> In
                           those very places, they shall receive the true worship of God, and by this means shall become and be called <I>the children
                           of the living God.</I> He is so particular as to place, lest the Jews should imagine that the Gentiles would be converted
                           like their former proselytes, and either dwell in Judea, or repair to it at certain stated times. Thus the apostle repeats
                           what Jesus Christ had before said to the Samaritan woman. <I>The hour will come when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem,
                           shall you adore the Father.</I> (Estius) (John iv.) --- <I>A remnant.</I> That is, a small number only of the <I>children
                           of Israel</I> shall be converted and saved. How perversely is this text quoted for the salvation of men of all religions,
                           when it speaks only of the converts of the children of Israel. (Challoner) --- St. Paul is here speaking of the reprobation
                           of the Jews, and of the vocation of the Gentiles, and foretells that a remnant, or small number of the children of Israel
                           shall be converted, and saved. In the sense of St. Paul, we sincerely hope, and confidently trust, that a remnant of all will
                           be saved through a timely conversion. But we no where read, in the <I>Old,</I> or <I>New</I> Scriptures, that <I>a remnant
                           of all will be saved,</I> as if it were a matter of indifference to what society or connexion a Christian was joined. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>What then shall we say?</I> Or what shall we conclude from these testimonies of the Scripture, but this paradox, as St.
                           Chrysostom calls it, that they who sought for justice, or sanctification, found it not, and they who did not seek it, found
                           it; that is, the Jews, who sought for this justice by the works of their law, which they magnified so much, have not attained
                           to that <I>law</I> that could make them just; whereas the Gentiles, who had no such written law to confide in, have only sought
                           to be justified by the <I>faith</I> and law of Christ, by which they have met with justice, and sanctification? (Witham) ---
                           Behold what was wanting to the justice of the Jews! Scrupulous observers of the ceremonial law: esteeming too much their power,
                           and pretended justice, they regarded the gospel and faith in Christ as of no advantage. Running in the path of the commandments
                           with zeal, but without circumspection, they struck against Jesus Christ, who became to them a stumbling-block. They rejected
                           him: they refused to believe. Thus did their works become dead works, without any fruit for eternity. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>
