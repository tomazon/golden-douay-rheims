                           This was done, that the general might know what forces he could muster to attack the nations of Chanaan on the west side of
                           the Jordan, and also in order that the lands might be properly distributed. The war lasted seven years, and the distribution
                           of lands was not completed till some time afterwards. It is not clear that those who were not enrolled at this time, as being
                           20 years of age, would have any portion, except that of their fathers, allotted to them; but it seems however rational, that
                           those who were arrived at that age when the distribution was made, would have their share like the rest. There were 1820 people
                           fewer than in the register which was taken before, (chap. i.,) thirteen months after the departure from Egypt. The Levites
                           seem not to have been numbered with the utmost exactitude, as only five families are mentioned, (ver. 58, Jansenius,) though
                           there were many more, 1 Paralipomenon xxiii. 6, &amp;c. Their numbers amount to only 23,000. (Calmet) --- They had rather
                           increased in the desert during 38 years; (see chap. iii. 39,) as had also the tribes of Juda, Issachar, and Zabulon, which
                           lay to the east; of Manasses, (who perhaps on that account precedes <I>Ephraim</I>) and Benjamin, to the west; Dan and Aser
                           to the north. Nephtali proved deficient; so did likewise the tribes of Ruben, Simeon, and Gad, who were stationed to the south
                           of the tabernacle. When they were numbered the first and the second time (Exodus xxxviii. 25, and Numbers i. 46,) they amounted
                           to 603,550, exclusively of the Levites. Now they could only count 601,730 men fit for war. Considering their frequent disasters,
                           it is even a matter of surprise that their ranks were not thinned still more, particularly as we are assured that all who
                           had been numbered before, except Josue and Caleb, the Levites, and such as had kept themselves free from murmuring, had perished,
                           ver. 64. (Haydock) --- In the particular accounts of the tribes, and in the names of persons, the Septuagint frequently differ
                           from the Hebrew. But the total amount agrees.</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew, "they became a sign," of reproach, and a memorial of God's just judgments, who caused the earth to swallow up Core
                           and his companions alive, by a most disgraceful kind of death, to which the faithless vestal virgins were condemned at Rome,
                           being buried alive; while those who had offered incense were consumed by fire. Many of the ancients assert that Core was also
                           burnt, meaning perhaps by the fire of <I>hell;</I> to which he descended. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] iv. 3.) --- Others have
                           thought that the children of Core were swallowed up with their father. But this is not true, with respect to some of them
                           at least, (Haydock) who by a miracle of the divine grace and goodness, were preserved from joining in his sedition; (Calmet)
                           while Core, his wife and servants, all concurred to shew them such a pernicious example. (Haydock) --- Lyranus and the Rabbins
                           tell us, that the children stopped to intreat their father to repent; and while the earth opened under them, God supported
                           them in the air, and gave them the spirit of prophecy; so that they sung, (Psalm xlv.) <I>God is our refuge,</I> &amp;c.,
                           or, according to others, the Psalm xli. which has their name in the title. But these accounts are to be received with caution.
                           The Samaritan text, <I>fuerunt in fugam,</I> (Calmet) may be translated, "out of this world they fled away, (11) and the sons
                           of Core did not perish."</FONT></P><B>

                           Josue appointed commissioners, who measured the land, and divided it according to its fertility; and the portions assigned
                           to each of the tribes by lot, corresponded with the predications of Jacob and of Moses; God so regulating the lots by his
                           allwise Providence, in order that the people might be more convinced of the truth of the prophecies, and that no undue favour
                           was shewn to any one by Josue, Eleazar, or by the other men in authority. He took the whole upon himself, that none might
                           complain of their rulers. (Calmet) --- Masius supposes that the different divisions of the land were written down, and placed
                           in an urn, and that the heads of the tribes drew according to their birth, Josue xv. 1. --- The <I>heads</I> of <I>families,</I>

                           of the promised land, but are not suffered to cross the Jordan. The uncircumcised are introduced into the land flowing with
                           milk and honey, not by Moses, but by Josue, the figure of our Saviour, who opens heaven to true believers. "The first people
                           is rejected, which had received circumcision, and the second is introduced, which is gathered from the Gentiles; and it is
                           this people which obtains its father's inheritance....If Moses give any inheritance, it is not within the Jordan....it is
