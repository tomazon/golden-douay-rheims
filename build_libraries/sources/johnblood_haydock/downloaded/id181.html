                           apostle had been obliged, in different parts of his first epistle, to say some things to his own advantage, in order to maintain
                           the dignity of his ministry against false teachers, who had endeavoured to lessen his authority. He is again obliged to shew
                           the excellency of his ministry, and the superiority of the gospel over the law of Moses. (Theodoret) --- We have not need,
                           he says, of commendatory letters, like those false teachers: we have only to say that we founded the Church of Corinth, and
                           we shall be sufficiently known. Your religion, your piety, and your virtues are renowned in the whole world. (ver. 2.) This
                           is our letter: we have no need to speak: the effects speak for themselves. But still this is not our doing; for we are not
                           sufficient to think any thing of ourselves. (ver. 5.) This letter is not of our writing; we could only do the same as Moses
                           in the old law, prepare the tables, (ministered by us) it was God himself that wrote the ten commandments, and it is God himself
                           that has written this our letter, by implanting his faith in your hearts. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           and of the glorious duties of the apostleship? How ought our glory to be manifest, and who is fit for such an undertaking.
                           If I thus extol the excellency of my ministry, do not imagine that I attribute any thing to myself. I am unworthy of this
                           office, which so far surpasseth that of Moses, that his glory (ver. 10.) could not be truly called glory, when compared with
                           this of ours, which so far excelleth his. (Calmet) --- The letter of the New Testament also, not truly taken or expounded
                           by the Spirit of God, which is in his Church, must in the same manner be said to kill. See St. Augustine, serm. 70. &amp;
