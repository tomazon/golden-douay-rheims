                           <i>Abimelech</i> was encouraged to contend with his brethren as he saw the indifference which the people shewed for them,
                           and as he was of a bold enterprising temper. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Men,</i> particularly to those who have the greatest influence. Hebrew <i>Bahalim.</i> (Menochius) --- The argumentation
                           of Abimelech tended to prove that monarchy was the most perfect and eligible form of government, and that it would be hard
                           upon the people, and greatly weaken the state, if seventy princes were to be supported in all the dignity of kings. But it
                           was easy to discern the fallacy of his reasons. The dignity of judge was not hereditary, and it does not appear that the sons
                           of Gedeon claimed it. If it had belonged to his family, the eldest would have been entitled to it, or any of the children,
                           in preference to this son of the servant, ver. 18. He was, indeed, born at Sichem; but the others were by no means strangers:
                           (Calmet) and what right had the men of this town to give a ruler to Israel? (Haydock) --- <i>Flesh,</i> an usual expression
                           in Scripture to denote kindred, ver. 3., Genesis ii. 23., and 2 Kings xix. 13. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Weight.</i> Hebrew, Chaldean, and Septuagint do not express what quantity of silver was given. (Menochius) --- But sicle
                           on such occasions is generally supplied. (Calmet) --- Hence this sum would amount to little more than 8<i>l.</i> sterling.
                           (Haydock) --- As this appears too insignificant a sum to maintain an army, (Calmet) some would supply pounds, each consisting
                           of 24 sicles, or talents, which were equivalent to 3000 sicles. (Menochius) --- But this is without example, and the army
                           of Abimelech was, probably, a company of banditti, or villains, who went with him to Ephra, to murder his brethren, and afterwards
                           kept near his person. When he had got possession of his father's estate, and of the sovereign power, he found means to supply
                           his wants. (Calmet) --- <i>Baalberith.</i> That is, Baal of the <i>covenant,</i> so called from the covenant they had made
                           with Baal, chap. viii. 33. (Challoner) --- The custom of keeping money in temples was formerly very common. Almost all the
                           cities of Greece sent money to the temple of Apollo, at Delphos, (Marsham, sæc. xvii.) where the people of Rome and of Marseilles
                           had also some. The different cities had likewise holes cut in the rock of Olympia, in Elis, for the same purpose. The public
                           treasury was, almost universally, some temple. That of Rome was the temple of Saturn. --- <i>Vagabonds.</i> Hebrew, "empty
                           and inconstant" (Calmet) people who had nothing to lose, and who would not embrace any proper method of getting a livelihood.
                           (Haydock) --- Chaldean, "seekers." Septuagint, "stupid." Symmachus, "idle and of desperate fortunes, <i>or</i> frantic." (Calmet)
                           --- Such people are generally at the head of every revolution, or, at least, are ready to follow the directions of some powerful
                           and designing man; as but too many instances, both in ancient and modern times evince; which ought to be a caution for all
                           to watch their motions. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Stone</i> where criminals were, perhaps, commonly executed, that he might seem to act with justice, (Tostat) or he might
                           slaughter his brethren on the very altar, which had been erected to God by Gedeon, after he had thrown down that of Baal.
                           By doing so, he would seem to vindicate the idol, and gratify the people of Sichem, who were zealous idolaters, ver. 46. Joatham
                           escaped his fury, yet he, also, uses a round number, 70, when he says <i>you have killed</i> 70 <i>men,</i> ver. 18. (Calmet)
                           --- Abimelech himself must also be deducted from the number. Thus we say the seventy interpreters, (Menochius) though the
                           Greek interpreters of the Bible are supposed (Haydock) to have been 72. (Menochius) --- The history of nations is full of
                           similar instances of cruelty. Ochus, king of Persia, killed his uncle, and 80 or 100 of his sons. Phraartees, son of Herod,
                           king of the Parthians, by a concubine, slew his father and his 30 children. (Justin. x. and xlii.) --- The Turkish emperors
                           have shewn equal barbarity on many occasions, and they still murder or confine all their brothers. (Serar. q. 6.)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Mello.</i> We know of no such city in the vicinity of Sichem. Hebrew, "all the house of Millo:" which some take to be the
                           town-house of Sichem, full of the chief citizens, as Mello signifies "filled up;" (Vatable) or it might designate some part
                           of the city which had been levelled, like the deep valley at Jerusalem, (3 Kings ix. 15.; Haydock) and where some powerful
                           family, probably the father of Abimelech's mother, might dwell. (Calmet) --- This family would interest itself the most in
                           the advancement of the tyrant, ver. 3. (Haydock) --- <i>Oak.</i> Hebrew, "the plain,<i> or</i> oak of the statue," (alluding
                           to the monument which was left here by Josue, ver. 37., Josue xxiv. 26) or Septuagint, "of the station," as those of Sichem
                           might assemble here to deliberate on public affairs, (Calmet) in memory of the solemn covenant between God and the people.

                           Joatham addressed the people of the city, probably during the absence of Abimelech, (Calmet) when, Josephus ([Antiquities?]
                           v. 9.) says, a great festival was celebrated.</font></p><b>

                           <i>Us.</i> By this parable, Joatham expostulates with the men of Sichem, who had so basely requited the labours of Gedeon,
                           and had given the preference to the son of a servant, who was of the most savage temper. (Haydock) --- In a spiritual sense,
                           which the Fathers chiefly regard, heretics and schismatics act in this manner, and choose rather to be governed by those who
                           will allow them to follow their passions, than by such governors as God has appointed, though the latter be endued with the
                           grace of the Holy Ghost, and with all virtues, signified by the olive and other fruit trees. They prefer the bramble, or the
                           worst dispositions, like Nemrod, Mahomet, Antichrist, &amp;c., who, after persecuting the virtuous, and Catholics for a time,
                           (2 Thessalonians ii.) will, in the end, prove their ruin, though they themselves be involved in the common destruction. "Fire
                           shall rise (says Ven. Bede, q. 6.) against this bramble, Antichrist, and shall devour him, and all his together." (Worthington)
                           --- The use of parables has been very general. (Menochius) --- Agrippa brought the Roman plebeians, who had retired to the
                           sacred mount, to a sense of their duty, and to a love of mutual harmony with the nobles, by observing that the members once
                           refused to supply the wants of the belly, because it did not labour like the rest. (Livy ii.) --- In the application of these
                           parables, Maimonides justly remarks, that we must consider their general scope, and not pretend to explain every circumstance;
                           (More. Neboc.) a remark which Origen had already made. Many things are only added for the sake of ornament. (Haydock) ---
                           Thus we need not imagine that the people of Sichem offered the sovereign authority to many, who refused to accept of it, and
                           at last only prevailed upon Abimelech. Gedeon had, indeed, rejected a similar offer, (chap. viii. 22.) and his other sons
                           not endeavouring to retain the authority of their father, the Sichemites acceded to the petition of Abimelech, to <i>anoint</i>
                           him <i>king.</i> This expression does not always imply a material unction, though such was used among the Jews. It signifies
                           the granting of all the power of a king; in which sense it is applied to foreign princes, (Isaias lxv. 1.) and to Jesus Christ,
                           (Daniel ix. 24.) who received the reality of that sovereign dominion, of which this unction was only a figure. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           of the public, so that he must frequently be full of anxiety and care. (Calmet) --- <i>Use of.</i> The olive-tree is introduced,
                           speaking in this manner, because oil was used, both in the worship of the true God, and in that of the false gods, whom the
                           Sichemites served. (Challoner) --- The pagans burnt lamps in honour of their idols, and anointed their statues: <i>unguentoque
                           lares humescere nigro.</i> (Prud., contra Sym. 1.) --- They also anointed their military standards at Rome. (Pliny, [Natural
                           History?] xiii. 3.) --- The same author observes, that "two sorts of liquor are very delightful to the bodies of men: wine

                           bodies, as well as to give them light. (Calmet) --- It spiritually denotes the grace of God, which establishes the peace of
                           the soul, as the fig-tree signifies the sweetness of God's law, producing good works, and the vine shews forth those noble

                           Plutarch observes, (in Scylla) that the Lacedemonians did not like to attack walls, because the bravest men are there often
                           slain by the greatest cowards. (Calmet) --- Hence Joab puts this advice in the mouth of David, that it is imprudent to come
                           too near the walls, 2 Kings xi. 21. --- <i>Skull,</i> (cerebrum) "brain." Yet the tyrant's understanding was not perhaps so
                           much impaired, as to excuse him for commanding his armour-bearer to kill him. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Slew him.</i> The ancient heroes were always attended by their armour-bearers. (Calmet) --- Marius ordered his servant
                           to run him through, that he might not be exposed to the insults of his enemies; and V. Maximus (vi. 8,) greatly commends the
                           servant for doing so. <i>Nihil eorum pietati cedit, a quibus salus Dominorum protecta est.</i> David was not of the same opinion,
                           since he punished the Amalecite who pretended that he had rendered this service to Saul, 2 Kings i. 16. The Christian religion
                           condemns both those who engage others to take away their life, and those who comply with the impious request. Hercules was
                           affected in the same manner as Abimelech, when he found that he was to die by the malice of a woman. <i>O turpe fatum! femina
                           Herculeæ necis---Auctor feratur.</i> (Seneca) --- The Lacedemonians were not eager to besiege Argos, when they saw that the
                           women were engaged in its defence. (Pausan. ii.) (Calmet) --- Notwithstanding the wicked precaution of Abimelech, what he
                           so much feared took place; for Joab said, <i>Did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, and slay
                           him in Thebes?</i> (2 Kings xi. 21.) His skull was so much fractured, that he had received a mortal wound: the sword only
                           hastened his death. Thus was he justly punished with a stone, who had slaughtered 68 or 69 of his brethren <i>upon one stone.</i>
                           (Haydock) --- He can only be considered as an usurper or tyrant, since he was neither chosen by God nor by the Israelites
                           in general. Hence he is only said to have reigned at Sichem. (Cornelius a Lapide) --- He was going to extend his conquests
                           over other cities and tribes, when he was slain at Thebes. (Josephus) (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 With his own company, assaulting and besieging the city: whilst the
                                    two other companies chased the enemies that were scattered about the field.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">45 And Abimelech assaulted the city all that day: and took it, and killed
                                    the inhabitants thereof, and demolished it, so that he sowed salt in it.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">46 And when they who dwelt in the tower of Sichem, had heard this, they
                                    went into the temple of their god Berith, where they had made a covenant with him, and from thence the place had taken its
                                    name, and it was exceeding strong.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">47 Abimelech also hearing that the men of the tower of Sichem were gathered
                                    together,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">48 Went up into Mount Selmon, he and all his people with him: and taking
                                    an ax, he cut down the bough of a tree, and laying it on his shoulder, and carrying it, he said to his companions: What you
                                    see me do, do ye out of hand.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">49 So they cut down boughs from the trees, every man as fast as he could,
                                    and followed their leader. And surrounding the fort, they set it on fire: and so it came to pass, that with the smoke and
                                    with the fire a thousand persons were killed, men and women together, of the inhabitants of the tower of Sichem.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">50 Then Abimelech, departing from thence, came to the town of Thebes,
                                    which he surrounded and besieged with his army.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">51 And there was in the midst of the city a high tower, to which both
                                    the men and the women were fled together, and all the princes of the city, and having shut and strongly barred the gate, they
                                    stood upon the battlements of the tower to defend themselves.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">52 And Abimelech, coming near the tower, fought stoutly: and approaching
                                    to the gate, endeavoured to set fire to it:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">53 *And behold, a certain woman casting a piece of a millstone from above,
                                    dashed it against the head of Abimelech, and broke his skull.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">54 *And he called hastily to his armour-bearer, and said to him: Draw
                                    thy sword, and kill me: lest it should be said that I was slain by a woman. He did as he was commanded, and slew him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">55 And when he was dead, all the men of Israel that were with him, returned
                                    to their homes.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">56 And God repaid the evil, that Abimelech had done against his father,
                                    killing his seventy brethren.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">57 The Sichemites also were rewarded for what they had done, and the
