                           truth think himself worse than the most wicked of men? He answers, that a man who has received very extraordinary gifts from
                           God, cannot think these gifts less than what any other has received; but <I>he</I> may reflect that he has nothing, and is
                           nothing of himself. And a man truly humble considers only his own sins and failings, and is persuaded that any other person
                           would have made better use of the same graces; which agrees with what follows, (ver. 4) <I>not considering the things that
