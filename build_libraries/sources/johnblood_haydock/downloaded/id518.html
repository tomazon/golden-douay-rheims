                           maintenance, 1 Corinthians ix. 8, 9, 10. (Challoner) --- Other labourers, and even beasts, must likewise be treated with humanity.
                           It was formerly the custom in Egypt, Judea, Spain, &amp;c., to have a clean spot in the field, round a tree, where during
                           the heat of the day, they spread the sheaves, and made oxen continually go round, to tread out the corn. Some had the ill
                           nature to muzzle them, or to cover their mouths with dung; (Æliian iv. 25,) whence arose the proverb, "an ox in a heap" of
                           corn, to denote a miser, who amidst plenty will not eat. (Suidas.) --- Moses condemns this cruelty; as it is not just, says
                           Josephus, to refuse these animals so small a recompence for the assistance which they afford us in procuring corn. (Calmet)
                           --- Besides this literal sense, God had principally in view the mystical one, which St. Paul unfolds to us. (Menochius) ---
                           Paine hence takes occasion to ridicule priests, who, he says, "preach up Deuteronomy, for Deuteronomy preaches up tithes."
                           But this book enjoins them no more that other books of Scripture, and common reason dictates that the labourer is worthy of
                           his hire. If the artizan, &amp;c., will not work for nothing, why should priests spend their lives and fortunes, for the benefit
                           of the people, without deriving any advantage from them? Who has served in the wars at his own charge at any time? (1 Corinthians
                           ix. 7.) Whether the mode of paying tithes be the most eligible, for the support of God's ministers, is a question of smaller
                           importance. It may at least plead a very high antiquity, (Haydock) as it was in force 400 years before the law of Moses. Abraham
                           paid tithes to Melchisedeck, who was both king and priest; and Pisistratus received tithes from the people of Athens, to be
                           expended in the public sacrifices, and for the general good. (Laert. in Solone.; Watson, let. 2.)</FONT></P><B>

                           as the sons of Juda did: (Genesis xxxviii. 8,) though custom (Calmet) and analogy extend this to other brothers, at least
                           to those who live in the promised land, and have the inheritance in common, as appears from the history of Ruth, Ruth i. 13,
                           &amp;c. Noemi supposes that all the sons whom she might have had, would have been under the same obligation towards her daughter-in-law.
                           The Rabbins restrain this law as much as they can, asserting that if the deceased left an adopted or natural child, the brother
                           need not marry his widow, nor was any obliged but the next in age, and not married. St. Justin (q. 132,) teaches the reverse.
                           (Calmet) --- Half-brothers were included, (Menochius) and indeed every relation, in order, who, upon the refusal of the next
                           heir, wished to take possession of the deceased person's land, Ruth iv. (Haydock) --- The Jews no longer observe this law,
                           as they have not possession of Chanaan. (Cuneus i. 7.) --- Fagius asserts that it was neglected after the captivity of Babylon,
                           because the inheritances were confounded. (Calmet) --- This, however, does not seem to have been the opinion of those who
                           have undertaken to reconcile the genealogy of our Saviour, given by Sts. Matthew and Luke, by supposing that St. Joseph was
                           the son of Jacob by birth, and of Heli according to the law. (St. Hilary) Africanus says, (Ep. to Aristides) that "Heli dying
                           without issue, Jacob was obliged to marry his widow, by whom he had Joseph, a descendant of Solomon by Jacob, and of Nathan
                           by Heli," as their common mother, Esta, had married successively Mathan and Melchi, (or rather Mathat) who sprung from those
                           two branches of David's family. (Dupin) (Haydock) --- The Athenians followed a similar regulation with respect to orphan young
                           women, whom the next of kin were bound to marry and to endow. The Tartars assert their right to marry the widows of their
                           brethren. The Egyptians did not consider the marriage as real, nor any relationship contracted, in case the woman had no issue,
                           on which principle there was no impediment to prevent the brother from marrying the widow of his brother. On other occasions
                           such contracts were declared illegal, Leviticus xviii. 16. (Calmet) --- This was a positive law, (Worthington; Genesis xxxviii.)
                           which admitted of an exception.</FONT></P><B>

                           Josephus ([Antiquities?] iv. 8,) takes this literally, as St. Augustine once did, though afterwards he retracted that opinion,
                           (B. ii. 12,) on considering that Booz called his son Obed, and not Mahalon, which was the name of the first husband of Ruth,
                           Ruth iv. 17. (Calmet) --- Houbigant thinks some omissions have taken place in the very short genealogy of David, mentioned
                           in that chapter, and instead of Obed, he would substitute Jachin, as the first-born of Ruth. He thinks that Solomon alluded
                           to two of his ancestors, when he styled the two pillars before the temple Jachin and Booz. "In strength it shall stand <I>or</I>
                           establish," 3 Kings vii. 21. Hebrew, "the first-born which she beareth shall arise (or succeed) in the name (or by the right
                           and title) of his brother." See Numbers xxiv. 3. (Haydock) --- Name is sometimes put for succession, (Calmet) or instead of
                           another. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           our presence, (the three judges are specified) N, widow of N, hath taken off the shoe of N, son of N. She brought him before
                           us, and took off the shoe from his right foot, and spat in our presence, so that we saw her spittle upon the ground; and she
                           said to him, So shall he be treated who will not establish the house of his brother." Before this ceremony took place, the
                           widow was obliged to wait three months, to prove that she was not in a state of pregnancy; for if she were, the brother could
                           not marry her. He was never obliged to do it, but if he refused he was deemed infamous. The taking off the shoe was intended
                           to humble him, as well as to shew that he relinquished all his claim to the inheritance. Josephus ([Antiquities?] v. 11,)
                           says, that Ruth gave the relation who would not marry her, a slap on the face, or rather as it ought to be printed "she spat
                           in his face," which was a mark of the greatest ignominy, chap. xii. 14., Isaias l. 6., and Matthew xxvi. 67. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>
