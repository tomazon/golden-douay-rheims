                           was built on that side; and it seems natural that these tribes would erect it in their own territories, for the benefit of
                           their children. (Calmet) --- The effect would nevertheless have been equal, on which side soever it appeared, as the Jordan

                           Another of the tribe of Levi, and deputies from the other nine tribes, accompanied Phinees on this important occasion. The
                           Levites were most of all concerned, as their rights seemed to be particularly invaded. (Haydock) --- The princes of the tribes
                           did not (Calmet) perhaps (Haydock) go, but only men of high rank. Kimchi says, men set over a thousand. Hebrew, "ten princes
                           with him of each chief house, a prince of all the tribes of <FONT size=3>Israel, and each one head of the house of his fathers,
                           among the thousands of </FONT>Israel." (Calmet) --- These were commissioned by Eleazar, Josue, and all the congregation, to
                           endeavour to bring back their brethren to a sense of their duty, if they had so soon forgotten God, (Haydock) or if they should

                           Thus Phinees shews that he speaks in the name of those who still continued faithful to the Lord. He imputes the crime of apostacy
                           to Ruben, &amp;c., that they may declare more openly for what reason they had built this altar. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           As they lived in the country, where this idol had been adored, Phinees was afraid lest they might have built the altar in
                           his honour. He reminds them what destruction that worship had brought upon all Israel. He had been particularly zealous in
                           appeasing the wrath of God, and therefore speaks with more authority. Hebrew, "is not the crime of Phegor enough for us, that
                           we should not wish to expiate it until this day?" (Calmet) or Protestants, "is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from
                           which we are not cleansed until this day? (although there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord)." The stain of this
                           impiety still remained upon Israel. They ought, therefore, to endeavour by sincere repentance, to obliterate it entirely,
                           and not, by fresh provocations, enkindle the dreadful wrath of God. (Haydock) --- There was reason to fear lest the Lord should
                           punish this sin still more, as he is accustomed to do, when people relapse. (Calmet) --- All must therefore shew their zeal
                           to prevent such crimes, as the multitude sometimes suffers for the offence of one, when they do not take all possible care
                           to prevent it, ver. 20. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           habitation. Naaman loaded two mules with some of the earth. We cannot help admiring the zeal and the disinterestedness of
                           Phinees. He proposes to abandon some of the possessions on the other side of the Jordan, rather than that his brethren should

                           Hebrew seems rather defective; (Calmet) "called the altar, (Syriac supplies the altar of witness) for it shall be a witness
                           between us, that the Lord he is the God. <I>Ed,</I> "witness," is placed in the margin of Plantin's edition (Kennicott) and
                           the Protestants have inserted it in the text, though in a different character, (Haydock) as "it is confirmed by the Syriac,
                           Arabic, and Vulgate versions." Kimchi quotes the Chaldean paraphrase, as having the word <I>seid,</I> "witness," twice, which,
                           if read in two places formerly, has been lately omitted in one, as many other alterations have <I>perhaps</I> been made in
                           it, in conformity to the later copies of the Hebrew text. It is still found in one Chaldean manuscript and in that of Masius.
                           Between the two last words of this verse, some Hebrew manuscripts read <I>eva,</I> "He." "The Lord, He is the God;" which
                           not only gives an emphasis, but is expressly confirmed by the Chaldean; and indeed this seems to have been a common form of
                           confessing the belief of the one true God, 3 Kings xviii. 39. (Kennicott, Diss. i.) --- Masius would translate, "They made
                           an inscription upon the altar, declaring that it should be an eternal witness of their attachment to the Lord." <I>Cora,</I>
                           in effect, sometimes means to write, as <I>Alcoran,</I> in the Arabic tongue, signifies "the scripture" (Calmet) of the Mahometans,
                           which they hold in the utmost veneration, as containing the life and doctrine of their great prophet. The Septuagint (Grabe)
                           insinuate that Josue approved of what had been done, "and Jesus gave a name to the altar,....and said, it is a witness in
                           the midst of them, that the Lord God is their God." Thus, instead of war and destruction, which seemed to threaten Israel
                           on all sides, all ended in peace and harmony. If Christians would imitate the conduct of the Israelites, they would not so
                           rashly condemn their neighbours on every idle report; and, if our adversaries would condescend to examine seriously into the
                           grounds of charging idolatry upon us, and on that account waging an eternal war against us, it is to be hoped they would pronounce
                           our doctrine innocent, and reform their own iniquitous proceedings. (Haydock)</FONT></P><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>
