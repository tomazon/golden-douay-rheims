                           <i>Shiggaion</i> (Haydock) is a word which has greatly puzzled interpreters. See Robertson in <i>shoge.</i> Protestants have,
                           "Shiggaion of David." The Rabbins confess that they know not its meaning, and it is of no service for the explanation of the
                           psalm. (Berthier) --- St. Jerome follows the Septuagint, (Haydock) which may suit very well. Others have, "ignorance." (Menochius)
                           --- "Perplexity." (Calmet) --- "Secret." (Vatable) --- "Song of wanderings." (Parkhurst, &amp;c.) --- <i>Chusi</i> is scarcely
                           less difficult to understand. The person who has inserted this historical title, and many others, without much judgment, had
                           probably in view the wars of Absalom, and the curses of Semei. But the psalm seems rather to refer to the persecutions of
                           Saul, (Calmet; 1 Kings xxii. 8.; Menochius) who was of the tribe of Benjamin. (Haydock) --- Sts. Augustine, Basil, and Chrysostom
                           explain it of Chusi, (Worthington) the Arachite, from a town of Benjamin, (Calmet) who defeated the counsel of Achitophel,
                           (Worthington) as it is supposed that David was given to understand that his friend had betrayed him, and in consequence speaks
                           of him in such harsh terms. But if that had been the case, he would have suppressed what was founded on error; (Calmet) and
                           the supposition is contrary to the idea which we have of inspiration. Yet there is nothing in the psalm which requires the
                           harsh expressions to be applied to Chusi. They may as well refer to Achitophel, who spoke in answer to him.</font></p><b>

                           or the lamp continually burning before the altar, he will flee away. Should we wonder at this? the garments alone of Paul
                           drove him from possessed person." [Acts xix. 12.] (St. Chrysostom) --- Will modern sectaries still ridicule these things?

                           shews that we ought to follow the Vulgate. (Berthier) --- Absalom, or any other enemy, may be this lion. (Worthington) ---
                           They threatened David with utter ruin, which he could never have escaped, without God's visible protection.</font></p><b>

                           not to injure a friend: the pagans do as much. Duport therefore agrees with the Vulgate, and St. Jerome has, "If I have rendered
                           evil to those who did me any, and sent my enemies empty away;" or, as the Hebrew is in the future, "I will let my enemies
                           depart without fighting;" which is equivalent to, I will gain no advantage over them. (Berthier) --- The man who takes revenge,
                           injures himself, and becomes the devil's slave. (St. Augustine) --- David had been so far from giving way to ingratitude,
                           that he would not even hurt his enemy. (Haydock) --- He let Saul escape, when he might easily have slain him. [1 Samuel xxvi.]

                           many to come to thy tabernacle, (Menochius) to embrace the true religion, (Worthington) and sectaries will decrease. These

                           is not merely imputed, as the first Protestants foolishly imagined: for how should God reward those whom he saw still in sin,
                           and who were only reputed holy? a notion which their disciples have modified or abandoned, as they have also done what had

                           xxvii. 7.) (Berthier) --- God cannot but be displeased at every sin. He threatens the offender daily by secret remorse, or
                           by his preachers and good books. (Haydock) --- But he often defers punishment (Worthington) till death, when the measure of
                           crimes is full. (St. Augustine) --- This silence or delay is one of the most terrible of his judgments, (Haydock) and a mark
                           of his great indignation. If he were, however, to strike every one as soon as he had committed sin, where should we be? "He

                                    <p>2 O Lord, my God, in thee have I put my trust; save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me.</p>
                                    <p>3 Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, while there is no one to redeem me, nor to save.</p>
                                    <p>4 O Lord, my God, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity in my hands:</p>
                                    <p>5 If I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, let me deservedly fall empty before my enemies.</p>
                                    <p>6 Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life, on the earth, and bring down my glory to the dust.</p>
                                    <p>7 Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger: and be thou exalted in the borders of my enemies.</p>
                                    <p>And arise, O Lord, my God, in the precept which thou hast commanded: 8 and a congregation of people shall surround thee.</p>
                                    <p>And for their sakes return thou on high.</p>

                                    <p>Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice, and according to my innocence in me.</p>
                                    <p>10 The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought; and thou shalt direct the just: *the searcher of hearts and reins

                                    <p>11 Is my help from the Lord; who saveth the upright of heart.</p>
                                    <p>12 God is a just judge, strong and patient: is he angry every day?</p>
                                    <p>13 Except you will be converted, he will brandish his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</p>
                                    <p>14 And in it he hath prepared the instruments of death, he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn.</p>
                                    <p>15 *Behold he hath been in labour with injustice: he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.</p>
                                    <p>16 He hath opened a pit and dug it; and he is fallen into the hole he made.</p>
                                    <p>17 His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: and his iniquity shall come down upon his crown.</p>
                                    <p>18 I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice: and will sing to the name of the Lord the most high.</p>
