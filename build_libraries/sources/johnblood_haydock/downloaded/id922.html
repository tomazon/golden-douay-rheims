                           Jeremias xix. 13., and Sophonias i. 5. (Calmet) --- It is wonderful that Ezechias had not before removed these remnants of

                           had perhaps fallen into the hands of Juda, after the Israelites had been led away. (Calmet) --- Josias exercised the like
                           authority throughout all Samaria, (ver. 19.) as the country properly belonged to the house of David, and was God's peculiar
                           inheritance. (Haydock) --- We may, therefore conclude that He authorized Josias to act in this manner; and the new inhabitants
                           had no interest in maintaining the superstition of those who had lived there before them. The priest sent by Asarhaddon, had
                           taken up his residence at Bethel; whence it is inferred that the town, at that time, was in the hands of the Samaritans, (Calmet)
                           as it might be still, though Josias might exercise dominion in it as lord paramount. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 21. But Josias thought he was only imposing on him, or speaking through fear. The Jews assert that Jeremias
                           also opposed the king's design, 3 Esdras i. 28. (St. Jerome, ad Ctesip.) But this does not appear from the canonical Scripture.

                           had fought before, Judges v. 19. Herodotus (ii. 159.) says, that Nechos gained a victory over the Syrians at Magdolum, and

                           which was sung on his anniversary for many years, 2 Paralipomenon xxxv. 24. The mourning for this pious king became proverbial,
                           and resembled that which should be made for the Messias, Zacharias xii. 11. The life and death of Josias prefigured those
                           of Jesus Christ; who should be long expected as the restorer of the true religion, the teacher of a more excellent law, and
                           the most innocent victim for the sins of the people. The glorious Phase under Josias, was but a faint representation of the
