                           them a reasonable honour, and to imitate their lives? (Witham) --- Thus was fulfilled the promise which Christ had made his
                           disciples, viz. that they should perform greater miracles than he himself had done. St. Chrysostom repeats more than once,
                           that these clothes raised the dead, and that the apostles' shadow chased away all maladies, and triumphed over death. Perhaps
                           the unprejudiced reader may observe in this verse some reason for paying due regard to the relics, or whatever has belonged
                           to the saints.</FONT></P><B>

                           Jewish exorcists.</I> Among the Jews were some, who by calling upon the name of the true God, sometimes cast out evil spirits.
                           But these sons of Sceva seeing St. Paul cast out devils, by calling upon the name of Jesus, thought fit to do the same, though
                           they did not believe in Jesus Christ. And God punished them in this manner, as it is here related, at least two of them. (Witham)
                           --- It is uncertain whether the Jews really possessed the power of exorcising demoniacs. From the 12th chapter of St. Matthew,
                           one would be inclined to the affirmative opinion, as our Saviour seems to mention it as a thing well attested. The Jews pretended
                           they received their exorcisms from Solomon. On the other hand, neither the Old nor New Testament ever approve of this power
                           in them nor is it any where mentioned in Scripture that Solomon was the author of any such things. The old law was particularly
                           severe in condemning every kind of enchantment. It is certain, that they, in the time here spoken of, added much superstition
                           and magic to these rites. (Tirinus and others.) --- Josephus mentions remarkable instances of their power in exorcisms performed
                           in his own presence, and in that of the emperor Vespasian, and his whole army. (Lib. ii. chap. 25. The Jewish War) --- Extraordinary
                           things might possibly be performed by magic and collusion between these impostors and the demons. That this power of expelling
                           devils, resides in the Church, every page of primitive ecclesiastical history, testifies. Scripture is also equally explicit
                           on this subject. The exorcisms, says St. Cyprian, are the spiritual torments and scourges of the demons. (Ep. ad Demetrium.)
                           --- It was for this reason the Jews, on this occasion, used the name of Jesus; a name terrible to the infernal spirits, to
                           add power to their imprecations. Tertullian urges facts of this power in the Christians, with much energy and eloquence, in
                           his Apology. Prudentius has recorded the same, with equal elegance, in his verse ---</FONT></P>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">1 And *it came to pass, while Apollo was at Corinth, that Paul having

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 And he said to them: Have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?
                                    But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a Holy Ghost.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 And he said: In what then were you baptized? Who said: In John's baptism.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 Then Paul said: *John baptized the people with the baptism of penance,
                                    saying; That they should believe in him who was to come after him, that is to say, in Jesus.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 Having heard these things, they were baptized in the name of the Lord

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And when Paul had imposed his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon
                                    them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And all the men were about twelve.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for the space of three
                                    months, disputing and persuading concerning the kingdom of God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 But when some were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of the

                                    Tyrannus.*</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And this continued for two years, so that all that dwelt in Asia,
                                    heard the word of the Lord, Jews and Gentiles.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common miracles:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 So that even there were brought from his body to the sick handkerchiefs
                                    and aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the wicked spirits went out of them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 Now *some also of the Jewish exorcists, who went about, attempted
                                    to invoke over them, that had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus, saying: I conjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And there were certain men, seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest,
                                    who did this.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 But the evil spirit answering, said to them: Jesus I know, and Paul
                                    I know: but who are you?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And the man, in whom the evil spirit was, leaping upon them, and mastering
                                    them both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And this became known to all the Jews and the Gentiles who dwelt at
                                    Ephesus: and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And many of those who believed, came confessing and declaring their
                                    deeds.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And many of those who had followed curious arts, brought their books
                                    together, and burnt them before all: and computing the price of them, they found the money to be fifty thousand pieces of
                                    silver.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 So mightily increased the word of God, and was confirmed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 Now these things being ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he
                                    had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying: After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 So sending into Macedonia two of those that ministered to him, Timothy
                                    and Erastus, he himself remained for a time in Asia.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Now at that time there arose no small disturbance about the way of
                                    the Lord.*</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 For a certain man, named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver
                                    temples for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 Whom calling together, with the workmen of like occupation, he said:
                                    Ye men, know that our gain is by this trade:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 Now you see, and hear, that this Paul, by persuasion hath drawn away
                                    a great multitude, not only at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, saying: That they are no gods which are made with
                                    hands.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 So that not only this our craft is in danger of being vilified, but
                                    also the temple of great Diana shall be thought nothing of, yea, and her majesty shall begin to be destroyed, whom all Asia
                                    and the world worshippeth.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 Having heard these things, they were full of anger, and cried out,
                                    saying: Great <i>is </i>Diana of the Ephesians.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And the whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with
                                    one accord into the theatre, having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, companions of Paul.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples
                                    suffered him not.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 And some also of the rulers of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto
                                    him, desiring that he would not venture himself into the theatre.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 Now some cried out one thing, some another. For the assembly was confused,
                                    and the greater part knew not for what cause they were come together.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And they drew forth Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews thrusting
                                    him forward. And Alexander, beckoning with his hand for silence, would have given the people satisfaction.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 But as soon as they perceived him to be a Jew, all with one voice,
                                    for the space of about two hours, cried out: Great <i>is </i>Diana of the Ephesians.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And when the town-clerk had appeased the multitudes, he said: Ye men
                                    of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great Diana, and of Jupiter's
                                    offspring?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 Since, therefore, these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to
                                    be quiet, and do nothing rashly.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 For you have brought hither these men, who are neither guilty of sacrilege,
                                    nor of blasphemy against your goddess.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 But if Demetrius, and the craftsmen who are with him, have a cause
                                    against any man, the courts of justice are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be decided in a
