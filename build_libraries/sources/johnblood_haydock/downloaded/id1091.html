                           <i>Behemoth;</i> the elephant, (Challoner) "as some think." (Protestants' marginal note) (Haydock) --- This is the most common
                           opinion, though Sanchez explains it of the bull; and Bochart, after Beza and Diodati, declares in favour of the hippopotamus,
                           (Calmet) or "river horse." Parkhurst even thinks Bochart has proved this "to a demonstration." The sea or river horse, (Haydock)
                           is an amphibious animal, (Calmet) found in the Nile and Indus, and said to have the feet of an ox and the teeth of a boar,
                           but not quite so sharp, while the neighing, back, mane, and tail, resemble those of a horse. Its hide, when dry, is said to
                           resist even a musket-ball. (Button; Dict.) --- We find a good description of this animal in Watson, p. 91. But the plural
                           <i>Bemoth,</i> female (Haydock) "beasts," seems more applicable to the elephant, on account of its great size, as it is designated
                           by <i><u>theria</u>,</i> or <i>Bellua,</i> by the Greek and Roman authors. (Suidas.) (1 Machabees vi. 35.) (Pliny, [Natural
                           History?] viii. 3.) --- It may have received the name of elephant from (Calmet) <i>alp,</i> "to lead or teach," (Haydock)
                           on account of its great sagacity and strength. All that Job says of behemoth, may be well explained of it. The Fathers have
                           supposed, that the devil is meant: but we stick to the literal sense. (Calmet) --- He may, however, (Haydock) have been hinted
                           at by this name, (Worthington) as well as by that of leviathan. (Houbigant) --- <i>With thee,</i> on the same day, or as well
                           as thee. (Amama) --- <i>Grass.</i> The elephant does so, and is by no means savage. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "Yet, behold,
                           near thee wild beasts, equal to oxen, eat grass." (Haydock) --- The spontaneous productions of the earth, and branches of
                           trees, afford the principal sustenance to satisfy the prodigious stomach of the elephant; which is frequently twelve feet
                           high, and of a dark colour. A sword can scarcely pierce it in the back or sides. It has small eyes, eight teeth, and two tusks;
                           which last are sometimes above a hundred weight each, and being cast every tenth year, (Button) afford ivory. The proboscis
                           serves it instead of hands to collect the smallest grain, or to defend itself. (Haydock) --- The female goes with young a
                           whole year, and the duration of its life is generally supposed to be above a hundred. Elephants inhabit warm climates, and
                           were formerly much used in war, to carry wooden towers, from which twenty, or even thirty, men might throw darts, 1 Machabees
                           vi. 37. (Button.) --- If this greatest and most temperate of all beasts be overcome by the unicorn, or led by the nose, how
                           much more will God enable man to overcome the devil? (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           longevity, &amp;c. None approaches so near to man. (Pliny viii. 1.; Calmet; Lipsius, 1 ep. 50.; Amama) --- <i>Sword;</i> which
                           is the rhinoceros, killing the elephant under the belly with its horn; (Pliny viii. 20.; Grotius) or God seems to have entrusted
                           his sword to the elephant, for the destruction of his enemies. Nothing can withstand its fury, as it overturns houses and

                           <i>Stakes.</i> Serpents attack the eyes of the elephant, and sometimes drag it by the trunk into the deep, where it is drowned.
                           (Pliny viii. 12.; Solin xxxviii.) --- Others read with an interrogation: "Shall one take?" &amp;c. Will any one dare to attack
                           it openly? The elephant is taken by stratagem, either in pits covered with a little earth, or by a tame elephant in an inclosure,
                           and (Calmet) lying on her hack to receive the male. (Aristotle, anim. v. 2.) --- When he has entered, the gate is shut, and
                           the animal is tamed by hunger; being thus taken by his eyes, Judith x. 17. Chaldean, "They pierce his nostrils with bands."
                           Thus other animals are led about, (ver. 21) and the elephant might be so treated in those days; though of this we have no
                           account. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "his nose pierceth through snares;" or marginal note, "will any bore his nose with a gin?"
                           Here they conclude this chapter, which commences chap. xxxix. 31., in Hebrew. But the Septuagint agree with us. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Leviathan:</i> the whale, or some sea monster. (Challoner) --- Protestants' marginal note, "or a whirlpool." (Haydock)
                           --- But some animal is designated; and Bochart understands the crocodile, which agrees very well with the context. The Thalmudists
                           also say that the calbish is a small fish, which gets into the throat of the leviathan. They mean probably the ichneumon,
                           which kills the crocodile by that means. Leviathan, "the winding serpent," (Calmet) often denotes the dragon or crocodile,
                           (Psalm ciii. 26., and Isaias xxvii. 1.) which frequents the Nile. (Haydock) --- It can live as well by land as under water,
                           (Watson, p. 293) and hence may be translated, (Haydock) "the coupled dragon." (Parkhurst) --- Moses mentions the choled, (Leviticus
                           xi. 29.) which the Septuagint and most others translate, "the land crocodile:" but what could induce the Protestants "to render
                           it tortoise, we are at a loss to determine." Crocodiles lay about sixty eggs, like those of geese, in the sand, the warmth
                           of which soon hatches them. Their bodies are covered with scales, which are scarcely penetrable, except under the belly; and
                           they are between twenty and thirty feet in length, running very fast, straight forward, though their feet be short, and they
                           cannot turn easily. They have several rows of sharp teeth, which enter one within another, and their throat is very wide.
                           (Button.) --- The same word may however denote whales, (Parkhurst) which are the greatest fishes with which man is acquainted.
                           (Haydock) --- They may also be styled coupled dragons, because many smaller fishes accompany them, and they are well protected
                           by scales, &amp;c. (Menochius) --- This huge fish, perhaps the whale, representing the devil, is subject to God. (Worthington)
                           --- <i>Cord.</i> The crocodile may be taken, but with the utmost hazard; though the Tentyrites attacked it without fear, chap.
                           iii. 8. Herodotus (ii. 70.) says it may be caught with a hook, baited with hog's flesh, while the fisher has a pig grunting,
                           at which the crocodile comes open-mouthed. Having swallowed the hook, it is drawn to land, and its small eyes being filled
                           with dirt it is easily slain. But the method was not yet invented, or was deemed too rash in Job's days.</font></p><b>
