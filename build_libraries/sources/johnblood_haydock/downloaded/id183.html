                           times called sins, as Osee iv. 8. and in several places in Leviticus, by the Hebrew word <I>Chattat,</I> which signifies a
                           sin, and is translated a victim for sin. But as this is not the only interpretation, and that my design is always a literal
                           translation of the text, not a paraphrase, upon second thoughts I judged it better to follow the very words of the Greek,
                           as well as of the Latin text. For besides the exposition already mentioned, others expound these words, <I>him he hath made
                           sin for us,</I> to signify that he made Christ like unto sinners, a mortal man, with the similitude of sin. Others that he
                           made he reputed a sinner; <I>with the wicked was he reputed;</I> (Mark xv. 28.) God having <I>laid upon him all our iniquities.</I>
                           (Isaias liii. 6.) --- <I>That we might be made the justice of God in him;</I> that is, that we might be justified and sanctified
                           by God's sanctifying grace, and the justice we receive from him. (Witham) --- <I>Sin for us.</I> That is, to be a <I>sin-offering,</I>
                           a victim for <I>sin.</I> (Challoner)</FONT></P>
