                           can this be true, that Christ wrought greater wonders than any one else had ever done? We find recounted in the Old Testament,
                           the miracles of Elias and Eliseus, who raised the dead to life, healed the sick, and brought down fire from heaven; of Moses,
                           who afflicted Egypt with plagues, divided the Red Sea, for the passage of the Israelites, and brought water from the rock;
                           of Josue, who stopped the waters of the Jordan, for the passage of the children of Israel, and in the battle of Gabaon, made
                           the sun and moon stand still; in all which miracles, there appeared a greater manifestation of power, than in any of the miracles
                           wrought by our Saviour, during his ministry. But to this may be answered, that the miracles of our Saviour were much more
                           numerous than those of any of the saints of the Old Testament, even of Moses himself; particularly when we compare the few
                           years which he preached, and manifested the glory of his Father by his miracles, with the long life of Moses: Christ did not
                           preach full four years, whereas Moses governed the people forty years. Again, if the miracles of Jesus were not of so astonishing
                           a nature, at least they always had for their object, the healing of the sick, and the good of the people; which the prophets
                           have given us, as the distinguishing characteristics of the miracles of the Messias. Add to this, the ease and authority with
                           which he performs them, which are most sensible proofs of their superiority. But what chiefly distinguishes his miracles,
                           from those of the other saints, is, that he performed them in proof of his divinity, and of his mission, as the deliverer
                           of Israel: whereas the prophets only perform miracles, as the ministers of the Lord, and as so many voices, which foretold
                           the Messias. Besides, if the ancient saints could work miracles, they never could confer that power upon others, as Christ
                           did upon his disciples, of which the Jews themselves were witnesses, in all the places whither Christ sent his disciples.
                           We omit mentioning his resurrection, which at this time he had not performed, but had already foretold, and which was the
                           greatest miracle that has ever been performed. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>
