                           to Damascus to return him thanks, 4 Kings xvi. 10. This stupid blindness and impiety irritated God so much, that he abandoned
                           Juda to the arms of the king, who had been called in as a protector. How could he expect aid from gods who had suffered their
                           own country and people of Damascus to fall a prey to the invader! (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 At that time there was a prophet of the Lord there, whose name was

                                    angry with Juda, hath delivered them into your hands, and you have butchered them cruelly, so that your cruelty hath reached

                                    for your bon-dmen and bond-women, which ought not to be done: for you have sinned in this against the Lord, your God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 But hear ye my counsel, and release the captives that you have brought

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And they said to them: You shall not bring in the captives hither,

                                    the fierce anger of the Lord hangeth over Israel.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 So the soldiers left the spoils, and all that they had taken, before

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And the men, whom we mentioned above, rose up and took the captives,

                                    and drink, and anointed them because of their labour, and had taken care of them: they set such of them as could not walk,
                                    and were feeble, upon beasts, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to their brethren, and they returned to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 For the Lord had humbled Juda, because of Achaz, the king of Juda,
