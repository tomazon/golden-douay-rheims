                           <p><strong>Genesis xii.</strong></p>
                           <p><strong>Notes &amp; Commentary:</strong></p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 1.</strong> <i>Said:</i> not after his father's death, but before he left Ur; (Menochius) unless, perhaps,
                           Abram received a second admonition at Haran, which, from his dwelling there with his father, &amp;c., is styled his country.
                           He leaves his <i>kindred,</i> Nachor and his other relations, except Sarai and Lot, who go with him into Chanaan; and even
                           his <i>own house,</i> or many of his domestics and effects, and full of faith, goes in quest of an unknown habitation, Hebrews
                           xi. 8. (Haydock) --- St. Stephen clearly distinguishes these two calls of Abram. From the second, the 430 years of sojournment,
                           mentioned Galatians iii; Exodus xii, must be dated. (Calmet) --- This is the third grand epoch of the world, about [the year
                           of the world]&nbsp;2083, when God chooses one family to maintain the one faith, which he had all along supported. See Worthington
                           &amp;c.</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 3.</strong> <i>In thee,</i> &amp;c., or in the Messias, who will be one of thy descendants, and the source
                           of all the blessings to be conferred on any of the human race, Galatians iii. 16. Many of the foregoing promises regarded
                           a future world, and Abram was by no means incredulous, when he found himself afflicted here below, as if God had forgot his
                           promises. (Calmet) --- He was truly blessed, in knowing how to live poor in spirit, even amid riches and honours; faithful
                           in all tribulations and trials; <i>following God</i> in all things, ver. 1.</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 5.</strong> <i>Gotten,</i> (<i>fecerant</i>): made or acquired, either by birth or purchase, &amp;c. (Menochius)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 6.</strong> <i>Sichem.</i> At the foot of Mount Garizim, where Abram offered his first sacrifice in the land,
                           Deuteronomy xi. 30. (Kennicott) --- <i>Noble;</i> on account of the many tall and shady oaks, whence the Septuagint have the
                           high oak. Hebrew <i>Elon more</i>, the plain of Moreh, or of ostension, because God shewed Abram from this place, situated
                           about the middle of the promised land, what countries he would give to him in his posterity, after having exterminated the
                           Chanaanites, who then occupied the land as their own. The mentioning of these idolatrous nations here, gives us reason to
                           admire the faith and constancy of Abram, who neither doubted of the fulfilling of this promise, nor hesitated to adore the
                           true God publicly, ver. 7. Hence there is no reason for accounting this an interpolation. (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 8.</strong> <i>Bethel,</i> as it was called in the days of Moses, being the ancient Luza, chap. 28. <i>On
                           the west</i>, Hebrew, towards the sea or Mediterranean, which lay west of Palestine. <i>Bethel</i> signifies <i>the house
                           of God,</i> being honoured with two altars. (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 9.</strong> <i>Proceeding to the south,</i> Hebrew: means also <i>the desert,</i> as the Septuagint generally
                           translate <i>negeb</i>: other interpreters agree with the Vulgate. (Calmet)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 10.</strong> <i>Down into Egypt,</i> which lies lower than Judea: here the famine did not rage. God would
                           not allow him to go back to his friends. (Menochius)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 11.</strong> <i>Beautiful:</i> having yet had no children, though she must have been 65 years old. Abram acts
                           with prudence, and does not tempt God: if he had made known that the woman was his wife, he would have exposed his life to
                           imminent danger, amid a cruel and lascivious people; and being convinced of the chastity of Sarai, he did not, in the least,
                           apprehend that she would consent to any violation of her conjugal engagements. He did not, therefore, expose her virtue as
                           the Manichees pretended. (St. Augustine, contra Faust. xxii. 33; City of God xvi. 19.) (Haydock; Calmet) --- The event proved
                           the justice of Abram's suspicions, and God's interference shewed that he was not displeased with his concealing part of the
                           truth. Who can be so simple as to suppose, that we are bound to explain all our concerns to a foe? Do not we every day act
                           with the like caution as Abram did, when we have reason to fear danger? Do not we wish, when fleeing from an enemy's country,
                           that he should conclude we were taking a walk of pleasure? (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 13.</strong> <i>My sister.</i> This was no lie; because she was his niece, being daughter to his brother Aran,
                           and therefore, in the style of the Hebrews, she might truly be called his <i>sister;</i> as Lot is called Abraham's <i>brother.</i>
                           (Genesis xiv. 14.) See Genesis xx. 12. (Challoner) --- Others say, Sarai was the half-sister of Abraham, by another mother.
                           (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 15.</strong> <i>Pharao:</i> the usual title of the kings of Egypt, in Ezechiel's time, Ezechiel xxxii. 2.
                           Courtiers are often too ready to flatter the passions of the prince: these are punished along with Pharao (ver. 17); whence
                           we may conclude, that they concurred with him, to take Sarai against her will.</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 16.</strong> <i>Well.</i> Perhaps they made him some presents to gain his favour; (Menochius) or, at least,
                           they suffered him to remain quietly among them.</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 17.</strong> <i>Scourged Pharao</i> with unusual pains, sterility, &amp;c. that he might easily perceive that
                           his taking Sarai was displeasing to God. (Haydock) --- He did not intend to commit adultery indeed, but his conduct was tyrannical
                           and oppressive to the <i>stranger,</i> whom God protects, Psalm xliv.[cxlv. 9.?] (Menochius)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 20.</strong> <i>Led him away:</i> perhaps without allowing him time to vindicate his conduct, and with a degree
                           of contumely, to shew the king's displeasure; who durst not, however, injure Abram in his effects, nor suffer any of his subjects
                           to hurt him. The holy patriarch received his wife untouched, and departed with joy. (Haydock)</p></font></font>
