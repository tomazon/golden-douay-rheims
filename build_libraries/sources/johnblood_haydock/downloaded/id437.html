                           and wife of the two Ptolemies, Philometor and Euergetes, or Physcon. (Tirinus) --- The Egyptians took their sisters to wife
                           for a long time, by the authority of their laws, and in imitation of Isis. (Diodorus 1.; Clem. recogn. 9.) Solon permitted

                           These regulations seem to have been made from the beginning, or at least from the time of the deluge; since the nations not
                           subject to the law of Moses, are condemned for the transgression of them, ver. 24. See Genesis xix. 33. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           being born of your mother, while she was married to another. The marriages of brothers and sisters at the beginning, were
                           authorized by necessity; but now they are the more to be condemned, as religion forbids them. (St. Augustine, City of God
                           xv. 16.) Some Rabbins assert, that such connexions were lawful till the time of Moses. But St. Epiphanius (hær. 39,) maintains,
                           they had been condemned long before. Seneca (St. Augustine, City of God vi. 10,) acknowledges that such marriages of the pagan

                           Hebrew, "she is thy aunt." Some say that, in the old law, a person might marry his niece, but not his aunt; as the order of
                           nature would be inverted if the aunt were subject to her nephew. But others assert that the law was reciprocal, and excluded
                           the marriage of both. The emperor Claudius married his niece Agrippina, and authorized others to do the like. But only one
                           imitated him at Rome; (Suetonius) though Tacitus (An. xii.) says, other nations did it with solemnity, as they had no law

                           punished with death the man whose child was born lame. St. Augustine (q. 64,) believes that this law is still in force; and

                           (4 Kings xvi. 3; xviii. 1,) which shews that the children were not always burnt to death, but only lustrated, or made to pass
                           over or between two fires. Yet many assert that the children were frequently consumed in the flames, and God condemns the
                           cruel parents to be punished with death, chap. xx. 2. The brazen idol was heated red hot, and the unhappy victim was placed
                           in its arms, or the priests dragged the child over or between the fires. The surrounding nations delighted in human victims.
                           The Carthaginians offered them till the time of Iphicrates. Adrian abolished several such cruel customs among the Greeks.
                           See Porphyrius, de Abst. ii. Jerem. vii. 31. --- <I>God;</I> by causing any to suppose that he is cruel, like the idols. We
                           must mention his name with the utmost respect. "The mouth, which utters the sacred name of God, ought never to pronounce a
                           shameful word." (Philo de 10. præc.) Some think, that the idolaters honoured their god by committing an abominable action
                           in his presence. See Malvenda. But most people understand that human sacrifices are here forbidden. (Calmet) --- The nations
                           of Carolina very lately observed the same custom as the ancient idolaters, in sacrificing their children to the devil, by
                           buring them to death in a brazen statue. (Vives in Civ. Dic. vii. 19.) Moloch was represented as a king, in all his ornaments,
                           with the head of a calf. He was, perhaps, the idol adored by other nations, under the name of Saturn, who devoured his own
                           children. (Bonfrere) (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           punished so severely in the Sodomites, Genesis xix. Yet, even the philosophers of Greece were not at all ashamed of it. Bardesanes
                           assures us, that the eastern nations punished it with death, and would not allow the guilty the honours of burial. Those beyond
                           the Euphrates were so shocked at it, that they would kill themselves if they were only accused of such a crime. (Ap. Eusebius,

                           Moses speaks of what would shortly happen, as if it had already come to pass, which is familiar with the prophets. (Calmet)

                           used by Moses, shews to what a length the Chanaanites had carried their abominations; so that God, justly irritated, orders

                           Hebrew <I>hammam.</I> The same temporal punishment is inflicted upon all the aforesaid crimes, though they were not all equally
                           grievous. The smallest of them deserved to be treated with such severity, to prevent the spreading of such contagious vices.
                           (Haydock) --- The regulations respecting marriage, were not immutable, or all determined by the law of nature, which admits
                           of no dispensation. Only those relations in a right line, and the first in the collateral line, can be esteemed of this description.
                           (Du Hamel) --- If Protestants maintain, that all these regulations of Moses are part of the natural law, and bind Christians,
                           they must also allow that a person must marry the widow of his deceased brother, if he has left no children, Deuteronomy xxv.
                           God would never have established this general rule for his people, if it were in opposition to the <I>natural law;</I> which
                           is clear and obvious to all people by the light of reason, according to Aristotle. (Polit. ii.) Neither would so many holy
                           men have violated this law without reproof, if it had prohibited the marriages of two sisters, of aunts, &amp;c. See Genesis
                           xxix.; Exodus vi. 20. God never dispensed in the right line; (1 Corinthians v. 1,) and such relations, or even people in the
                           first collateral degree of consanguinity, marrying, are punished with death, chap. xx. Whereas those in the second degree,
                           or in the first of affinity, undergo a smaller punishment; which shews that the transgression, in both cases, is not against
                           the law of nature. No man ever undertook to dispense with the marriage of brothers and sisters; though Beza lays this to the
                           charge of Pope Martin V. But the person alluded to, only obtained leave to retain the sister of her whom he had privately
                           dishonoured, when his marriage could not be dissolved without great scandal. (St. Antonin. 3. p. tit. i. 11.) As, therefore,
                           some of these impediments were introduced by the positive ceremonial law of the Jews, which was abrogated by Jesus Christ,
                           they have no other force at present than what they derive from the authority of Christian republics, which have adopted some
                           and changed others, appointing, in some countries, death for the punishment of theft, and not of adultery, though the old
                           law enjoined the reverse. See chap. xx. 10, and Genesis xxxviii. 24; Exodus xxii. 1. The Church may, therefore, surely dispense
                           with those laws which she has enacted. (Worthington) (Council of Trent, Session xxiv. 3.) --- She has indeed restricted marriage
                           between relations to the fourth degree included, both of consanguinity and of affinity. See the Council of Lateran, under
                           Pope Innocent III. But she will not allow people to marry their aunts, brothers' widows, or sisters of their deceased wife,
                           as the Jews do. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>
