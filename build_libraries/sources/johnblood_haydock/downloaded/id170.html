                           <I>Am not I free?</I> The apostle in this place wishes to teach the Corinthians, how careful and solicitous they should be
                           not to give cause for scandal to their neighbour, and how anxious for his spiritual welfare, informing them, that as he refused
                           to take even what he had a just right to, as a minister of the altar, that is, to live by the altar, so they must do in like
                           manner, abstaining even from things lawful, for the good of religion. (Estius) --- <I>Am not I an apostle?</I> &amp;c. St.
                           Paul here, to the 20th verse, answers those reflections, which the new preachers at Corinth made against him and Barnabas,
                           as if they were only an inferior kind of apostles. To this he answers, that he had <I>seen Jesus Christ,</I> who appeared
                           to him. He tells the Corinthians, that <I>they</I> at least, ought to respect him as their apostle, who had converted them.
                           He tells them, that when any persons <I>ask about</I> his apostleship, he has this to say for himself, that he not only laboured
                           as an apostle in converting them, but also laboured without taking of them what might supply him and his companions with necessaries,
                           as <I>to meat</I> and <I>drink.</I> He insists upon this particular circumstance, to shew he did not preach Christ for gain-sake;
                           and at the same time brings seven or eight proofs to shew that he, and all who preach the gospel, have a <I>power</I> and
                           a right to be maintained with necessaries by them to whom they preach. 1. He had a title to be supplied with necessaries,
                           as being an <I>apostle.</I> 2. And by them, as being their apostle. 3. By the example of <I>a soldier,</I> who has a right
                           to be <I>paid:</I> of <I>a husbandman,</I> who has a right to partake of the fruit of his labours: of <I>a shepherd,</I> nourished
                           by the milk of the flock. (ver. 7.) 4. He brings the example of those who <I>threshed,</I> or trode out the corn by oxen,
                           as it was formerly the custom, that the threshers, nay even the <I>oxen,</I> when <I>treading out the corn,</I> were not to
                           be <I>muzzled</I> according to the Scripture, (Deuteronomy xxv.) but were to eat, and to be fed with the corn or straw; much
                           more men that labour, are to be fed with the fruit of their labours. (ver. 8. 9. 10.) 5. Nothing is more reasonable than to
                           supply those with corporal and temporal things, who labour to procure spiritual and eternal blessings for others. (ver. 11.)
                           6. They who preached to the Corinthians after St. Paul, were maintained by them; had not he and Barnabas as much right as
                           they? (ver. 12.) 7. He shews it by the examples of the ministers and priests in the law of Moses, who had a share of the sacrifices
                           and victims offered, and who, serving the altar, lived by the altar. (ver. 13.) 8. He brings the authority of our Saviour,
                           Christ, who said to his apostles, (Matthew x. 10.) <I>that a labourer is worthy of his meat,</I> or of <I>his reward, as it
                           is said, </I>Luke x. 7. But St. Paul puts them in mind, (ver. 15.) <I>that he did not make use of </I>his right, as to <I>any
                           of these things:</I> that he does not write in this manner, to get or have any thing of them hereafter: nay, he makes warm
                           protestations, says St. Chrysostom,[1] that he will take nothing of them; that he will preach <I>without putting</I> others
                           to <I>any cost;</I> (ver. 18.) that he will accept of nothing, <I>lest</I> thereby <I>he put any obstacle to the gospel,</I>
                           or gave any person occasion to say he preached for gain. He tells them, <I>it is better for him to die,</I> than, by taking
                           any thing of them, to <I>make void</I> this, which he has to <I>glory in,</I> and to justify himself against his backbiting
                           adversaries: the sense is, that he is willing to spend his life as well as his labours among them, sooner than in these circumstances
                           receive any temporal reward from them. Yet when the circumstances were different, he received of the Philippians (Philippians
                           iv. 15.) enough to supply him in his necessities. He also tells them here, that he does not pretend to glory of boast for
                           <I>having preached:</I> this being <I>a necessary</I> duty. --- <I>For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward.</I>
                           The sense seems to be, if I do this office cheerfully, and with a right intention to please God only, I shall have a copious
                           reward prepared for such a labourer: <I>if unwillingly,</I> and imperfectly, and not with a pure intention, I cannot expect
                           such a reward; though <I>still a dispensing of it is entrusted to me;</I> that is, it is always my duty to preach. Others,
                           <I>by willingly,</I> understand the doing of it in so perfect a manner, as not to receive any thing, and <I>unwillingly,</I>
                           when they would scarce do it, at least so zealously, unless they received what would maintain them. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           certain, from the testimony of the fathers, that St. Paul was not in the state of wedlock. St. Jerome informs us that the
                           apostle is here speaking of such holy women who, according to the Jewish custom, supplied their teachers with the necessaries
                           of life, as we see was done to Christ himself. It is evident from ancient records that this was a very prevalent custom in
                           Judea, and therefore a cause of no scandal; but to the Gentiles this custom was unknown, and therefore lest it might prove
                           a cause of scandal to any, St. Paul did not allow any woman to follow him as a companion. Tertullian denies, with St. Augustine
                           and St. Jerome, that St. Paul is here speaking of his wife. (Estius; Calmet) --- <I>A woman, a sister.</I>[2] Some erroneous
                           translators have corrupted this text, by rendering it, <I>a sister, a wife;</I> whereas it is certain, St. Paul had no wife,
                           (chap. vii. ver. 7. 8.) and that he only speaks of such devout women, as according to the custom of the Jewish nation, waited
                           upon the preachers of the gospel, and supplied them with necessaries. (Challoner) --- And to what end could he talk of burthening
                           the Corinthians with providing for his <I>wife,</I> when he himself clearly affirmeth that he was single? (Chap. vii. v. 7.
                           and 8.) This all the Greek fathers affirm, with St. Augustine, do op. Monach. chap. iv.; St. Jerome, adv. Jovin. chap. xiv.

                           it is evident by this epistle, that St. Paul at least then had not a wife, chap. vii. ver. 7. 8. And the ancient interpreters
                           expressly examined and rejected this translation. See St. Jerome against Jovian. lib. i. tom. 4. part 2. p. 167. edit. Ben.;
                           St. Augustine, lib. de opere Monach. tom. vi. chap. 4. p. 478. Nov. edit. The Greek word, as every one knows, signifies either
                           a woman or a wife. Nor doth any thing here determine it to signify a wife. He speaks of a woman, or of women that were sisters,
                           that is, Christians; so that a sister expounds what kind of woman it was. Dr. Hammond puts in the margin <I>a sister-woman,</I>
