                           See the annotations Matthew xv. 9, 11. It is groundless to pretend from this text, that the precepts and traditions of the
                           Church are not binding and obligatory, for Christ himself has commanded all to hear his Church, and obey their lawful pastors.
                           These indeed may be called the precepts of men, but they are precepts of men invested with power and authority from God, and
                           of whom Christ himself said, (Luke x. 16.) <I>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me.</P></I></FONT></FONT><B>

                           he desired to conceal himself, and could not, his will it seems was under control; but this is impossible. His will must always
                           take place. On this occasion, therefore, he wished himself to be sought for by these Gentiles, but not to be made known by
                           his own apostles. Wherefore it came to pass, that not the persons who were his followers, but the Gentiles who entered the
                           house in which he was, published his fame abroad. (St. Augustine) --- Jesus Christ commanded his disciples not to publish
                           that he was come into that country; not that he intended to cease from healing the infirm, and curing diseases, when he saw
                           the faith of the inhabitants deserved it; for he informed the Gentile woman of his coming, and made it known to as many others
                           as he thought worthy; but that he might teach us, by his example, to decline the applause of men. (Ven. Bede)</FONT></P><B>

                           part, in which St. Mark says that Christ was in the house, when the woman came to petition in behalf of her daughter, seems
                           to differ from the narration of St. Matthew, who says that the disciples besought Christ to dismiss her, because she cried
                           after them; by which he signifies, that she followed them as they were on the road. These apparent differences may thus easily
                           be reconciled. The woman came to our Lord when he was in the house, and he, according to St. Matthew, not answering her a
                           word, went out during the silence: the woman followed after, and by her perseverance obtained her request. (St. Augustine)</FONT></P><B>

                           a Syriac word. Jesus Christ, in the cure of this man, uses many and various actions; but as of their own nature they are no
                           ways equal to such a cure, they shew: first, that the cure was miraculous; and secondly, the virtue, which his divinity communicated
                           to his sacred body. (Bible de Vence) --- We must not suppose that our Saviour here groaned on account of any difficulty he
                           experienced in working this miracle, but only from commiseration for the man, whom he was about to heal; as likewise to shew,
                           how very difficult is the cure of those who are spiritually deaf and dumb by sin. He was affected in a similar manner when
                           he raised Lazarus to life, to shew with what difficulty a man, dead and buried in sin by evil habits, can arise from that
                           miserable state. (Denis the Carthusian)</FONT></P>
