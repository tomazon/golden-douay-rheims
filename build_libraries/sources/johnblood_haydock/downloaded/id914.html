                           and this difficulty may be obviated by saying, that Jeroboam's reign with his father continued six years, and that after he

                           priests boldly remonstrated with him, but to no effect; till the king perceived himself stricken with the leprosy. Josephus
                           ([Antiquities?] ix. 10.) says, a dreadful earthquake was felt at the same time, which is supposed to be that mentioned [in]
                           Amos i. 1., and Zacharias xiv. 5; (St. Jerome, &amp;c.) though Usher produces some chronological difficulties against this

                           to all civil transactions; and Isaias (vi. 1.) probably refers to this event. Syriac and Arabic, "he remained hidden." Josephus
                           (ibid.[ix. 10.]) says, "leading a private life." Thus aiming at too much, he lost all! (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Usher would place an interregnum of eleven years and a half, after the death of Jeroboam, to make the first year of Zacharias
                           correspond with the 38th of Azarias, during which, he supposes, the troubles mentioned [in] Amos vii., and viii., happened.
                           But this interregnum has no foundation, ver. 5. (Calmet) --- Capellus says it would have lasted above 22 years. He and Houbigant
                           would read, 28th: the latter adds ten years to the reign of Zacharias. The transcriber might easily omit the years, as they
                           end in the same manner as months. Arabic has "six years;" whence we may infer, that the copies formerly varied. The exploits
                           of Zacharias require a longer space than <I>six months.</I> (Chron. sac. p. 107, 110.)</FONT></P><B>

                           chooses rather to follow here this date, than to speak of the years of Achaz, who had not yet been mentioned. (Challoner)
                           --- But Joatham reigned only 16 years, (ver. 33.) so that this was the fourth year of Achaz. (Haydock) --- Usher says that
                           Osee did not ascend the throne till nine years after the death of Phacee, as he is asserted to have commenced his reign in
                           the twelfth year of Achaz, chap. xvii. 1. But another difficulty arises from the mention of this 20th year, as Phacee would
                           have reigned 22, instead of 20; (ver. 27.) for Joatham only commenced in the second year of Phacee. To reconcile these passages,
                           we may conclude that Osee conspired against the king of Israel in the 18th year of Joatham, gained possession of part of the
                           kingdom in the 20th of the same prince, and of the whole in the 12th of Achaz. (Calmet) --- The pretended interregnum ought
                           to be rejected, as the murderer of the late king would not delay to ascend the throne. Houbigant adds 10 years to the reign
                           of Phacee, as well as to that of Zacharias: the dates assigned to the kings of Israel being otherwise so much deficient, p.
