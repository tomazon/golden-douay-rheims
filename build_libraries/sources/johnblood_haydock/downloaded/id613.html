                           after the captivity. St. Peter ranks Samuel in the first place, Acts iii. 24. (Calmet) --- <I>Vision.</I> No prophet was publicly

                           Some would transpose these words to the end of the verse, as they think it improbable that Samuel should be in the place where
                           the high priest himself could enter only once a year. (Vatable, &amp;c.) --- But this change seems harsh and unnecessary,
                           as Heli and Samuel might be in apartments contiguous to the holy place. (Sanctius; Menochius; Calmet) --- During the night

                           Septuagint, "were cursing God." This is one of the places which the Jews have corrected. (Du Hamel) --- <I>Judge;</I> or condemn

                           "because his sons made themselves despicable, and he did not frown upon them." (Haydock) --- <I>Ciha</I> denotes, to correct
                           with a wrinkled face. (Menochius) --- Aquila, "he did not look black at them," nor avert his eyes with horror. All this iniquity
                           was done publicly, and in his presence; (Calmet) and he suffered his children to proceed without any restraint. It is not
                           sufficient to reprove, when a father can correct. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           We read not of an express oath; (Calmet) but the denunciation of God was equivalent. (Haydock) --- <I>Iniquity,</I> or punishment.
                           Nothing could withhold the indignation of the Lord, in correcting the sinner, though he would shew mercy eternally to the
                           penitent. But he saw the obstinacy of these priests, and their unhappy end. The sacrifices of the old law always presupposed
                           suitable internal sentiments, to grant the remission of sin; and even for the avoiding of the legal punishments, they must
                           have been offered in a true spirit of religion, which these abandoned wretches despised and neglected. (Calmet) --- God threatens
                           that he will punish their crimes for ever, as he abominates the contempt of priests. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew and Septuagint, "laid himself down to sleep." For how could he take any rest after such terrible threats? (Calmet)
                           particularly as light was beginning to appear, when he was called by God, ver. 3. --- <I>Doors.</I> Some walls had probably
                           been built, to enclose the curtains of the tabernacle. A priest would have been employed to open the sanctuary. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew <I>Neeman,</I> may be a title of dignity, or may signify that Samuel was confirmed and continued to be a prophet. (Calmet)

                           The whole people suffered along with their leaders. (Haydock) --- They were concerned in the prediction which was denounced
                           against the house of Heli. (Menochius) --- Septuagint, "and Samuel was entrusted to be the prophet of the Lord, to all Israel,
                           from the ends of the earth to the ends: And Heli was very old, and his sons going went forward, and their way was wicked before
                           the Lord." Thus they usher in the following catastrophe. (Haydock)</FONT></P><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>

                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">17 And he asked him: What is the word that the Lord hath spoken to thee?
