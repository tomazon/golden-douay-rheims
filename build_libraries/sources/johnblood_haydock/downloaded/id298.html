                           that a Christian emperor (Constantine) would in a short time extend the reign of Jesus Christ over the whole world. </FONT></P><B>

                           many powerful wicked kings, who should persecute the good, especially about antichrist's time, when the faithful at different
                           times should be oppressed, and forced to fly as it were into the wilderness to worship God in private. And when the end of
                           the world seems to draw near, the devil with greater malice will persecute God's servants, his time being short. Others apply
                           these predictions to the particular persecutions in the Church by the Jews, and by the heathen emperors in the first three
                           Christian ages[centuries] before Constantine's time, when idolatry was destroyed, when the face of the Church was changed,
                           and when she became victorious, and publicly triumphed over her former enemies, the heathens; and by the man child, whom God
