                           St. Luke, who was the author of this history, alludes, in this verse, to his gospel, which he calls his first discourse. In
                           that he informs us, not only of the actions, but also the doctrines of our Saviour. These words, to do and to teach, are the
                           abridgment of the whole gospel: here he gives us the Acts of the Apostles, that is, an history of their travels and preaching.
                           In the beginning of this work he speaks of all the apostles, and what they did before their dispersion. As soon as he comes
                           to the mention of St. Paul, he takes notice of no one else, but is entirely taken up with the narrative of his actions. He
                           addresses his book to Theophilus, which signifies a friend of God, or one who loves God, as if he intended to dedicate it
                           to all the faithful, who believed in, and loved God. But it is more probable that this was some distinct person, well known
                           to St. Luke, and illustrious for his birth, because he gave him the title of&nbsp;<I><U>kratiste</U>,</I> <I>most excellent.</I>

                           was written without distinction of verses, and without any stops, or <I>commas,</I> which were added afterwards) the construction,
                           and joining of the words in this verse, is ambiguous. The question is, with what part of the verse these words, <I>by the

                           rejected. 2. That he <I>gave his commandments by the Holy Ghost to his apostles;</I> that is, says St. Chrysostom, that he
                           gave them spiritual commands, that came from the Holy Ghost, or from his holy Spirit. 3. The most probable exposition seems
                           to be, <I>that he gave his </I>special <I>commandments to his apostles, or to those whom he chose</I> to be his apostles,

                           was given them, together with the Holy Ghost, to assist them therein for ever. (Bristow)</FONT></P><B>

                           &amp;c. Why did he not appear to all, but only to his disciples? Because to many of them, who did not know the mystery, he
                           would have seemed a phantom. For if the disciples themselves were diffident, and terrified, and required to touch him with
                           their hands, how would others have been affected? But we know from their miracles, the truth of the resurrection, which is
                           made evident to all succeeding generations. Perhaps the apostles did not perform miracles. How then was the world converted?
                           This is a fact which cannot be denied, and that it should have been brought about by twelve poor illiterate fishermen, without
                           miracles, would be the greatest of all miracles, far beyond the reach of all human means. (St. Chrysostom, hom. i. chap. 1.
                           on Acts.) --- "And speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom of God," as we read in the Greek, and in the Protestant version,

                           Greek word here to signify <I>eating:</I> for he observes that the apostles elsewhere prove Christ's resurrection by his <I>eating
                           and drinking with them.</I> (Acts x. 4.[41.?]) St. Jerome also says, the derivation of the Greek word, is from eating salt

                           come on the last day, in the same body, in the same majesty, to judge the living and the dead. This he had likewise promised,
                           in more than one place of the gospel, speaking of the vengeance, which he will exercise on the city of Jerusalem. St. Jerome,
                           St. Hilary, and many other ancients, have believed that the Son of God will appear again on Mount Olivet, and that all people
                           shall be assembled to judgment. (St. Jerome, super Joel iii. 2.; St. Hilary, super Matthew xxiv. 32.) --- And that same body,
                           which thus ascended to heaven, and which will thus descend, is given us in the blessed Sacrament. "O miracle! exclaims St.
                           Chrysostom, He that sitteth with his Father above, is at the same time handled by men below. Jesus Christ ascending to heaven,
                           both hath his flesh with him above, and hath left it with us below. Elias being taken up, left his disciple, Eliseus, his
                           mantle and double spirit, but the Son of Man ascending, left his own flesh for us." (Lib. iii. de Sacerd. hom. 2. ad pop.
                           Ant. hom. de divit. et paup.) --- Sulpicius Severus, and St. Paulinus, assure us, that the marks of the feet of our Saviour
                           were imprinted in the place off which he rose to heaven; and St. Augustine informs us, that many in his time went to Judea,
                           to venerate these sacred marks. Ven. Bede testifies the same in the eighth age [i.e. in the 8th century]. In the time of Constantine
                           the great, the empress Helen built a church on the place. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           27.) She undoubtedly communicated to the evangelists many circumstances relative to the actions, words, and mysteries of her

                           methods which was inspired by God; but can seldom or ever be imitated. Where both candidates appeared equally worthy, as in
                           the present case, and human judgment cannot determine which is to be preferred, it cannot be said that it was wrong to decide
                           it by lots. Thus were avoided any of the evil consequences which might have happened by one party being preferred before the
                           other. St. Augustine observes, that in a doubtful case, where neither part is bad, to decide by lots is not in itself wrong.
