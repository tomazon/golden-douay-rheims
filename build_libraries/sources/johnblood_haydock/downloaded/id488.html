                           a present of some land. Josephus (ver. 11) asserts, that the person whom Booz addressed had already possession, and that he

                           and 362.) (Kennicott) (Haydock) --- We see here the observance of two laws, the one preserving the inheritance in the same
                           family, and the other obliging the next of kin to marry the widow of the deceased, if he would enjoy his land, Leviticus xxv.
                           10., and Deuteronomy xxv. 5. (Calmet) --- Such widows as designed to comply with this condition, took possession of the land
                           on the death of their husband, and conveyed it to those whom they married, till their eldest son became entitled to it. (Abulensis,
                           q. 30 to 61.) --- <I>Inheritance. </I>The son to be born, would be esteemed the heir of his legal parent. (Menochius)</FONT></FONT></P><B></B>

                           Onan had the same pretext, Genesis xxxviii. 9. Chaldean, "Since I cannot make use of this privilege, having already a wife,
                           and not being allowed to take another, as that might cause dissensions in my family, and spoil my inheritance, do thou redeem

                           prescribed, Deuteronomy xxv. 7. But Josephus says, that they complied with all the regulations of the law, and that Ruth was
                           present on this occasion. (Calmet) --- Perhaps the law was not executed in all its rigour, when another was found to marry

                           he was guilty of no sin, as Beza would pretend. (Tirinus) --- Some also remark, that the exclusion of the people of Moab from
                           the Church of God, regarded not the females, (St. Augustine, q. 35, In Deut.; Serar.; Tirinus; &amp;c.) particularly if they
                           embraced the true religion. According to the Rabbins, Obed should have been accounted a Moabite, as they say children follow

                           adduced by Houbigant, to shew that this genealogy is now imperfect. He concludes that Salma ought to be admitted, as well
                           as Salmon; and, as the reason for calling the first son of Ruth, Obed, "serving <I>or</I> ploughing," seems rather harsh,
                           as we should naturally expect some more glorious title. He thinks that the immediate son of Ruth was called Jachin, "he shall
                           establish;" and that Solomon called one of the pillars before the temple by his name, as he did the other Booz, "in strength,"
                           in honour of his ancestors. <I><I><FONT size=3>B</FONT><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman">á</FONT></FONT><FONT

                           established his father's house, (ver. 10, 11,) so these pillars denoted the stability of the temple. We must thus allow that
                           the hand of time has mutilated the genealogy of David, and that two ought to be admitted among his ancestors, who have been
                           here omitted, as St. Matthew likewise passes them over as well as three others, who were the descendants of Joram. The same
                           omission of Jachin occurs 1 Paralipomenon ii. 11, where we find Salma instead of Salmon. Houbigant supposes that the sacred
                           writers, Esdras and St. Matthew, gave the genealogies as they found them, without correcting the mistakes of transcribers.
                           (Chronolog. sacra, p. 81.) But there might be some reason for the omission which we do not know; and Nahasson, Booz, and Joram
                           might be said to beget Salmon, Obed, and Jechonias, though they were not their immediate children. Salien and many others
                           assert, that there were three of the name of Booz, succeeding each other, so that six persons instead of four fill up the
                           space of 440 years, from the taking of Jericho till the building of the temple. Salien, in the year of the world 2741, in
                           which year he places the birth of the third Booz, who married Ruth, seventy years afterwards. Petau allows 520 years from
                           the coming out of Egypt till the fourth year of Solomon, so that he leaves above 420 years to the three generations of Booz,
                           Obed, and Isai. But he prudently passes over this chronological difficulty. Usher supposes that each of these people were
                           almost 100 years old when they had children; and he produces many examples of people who lived beyond that age, but he does
                           not mention any, since the days of Moses, who had children at such an advanced age, much less that many in the same family,
                           and in succession, were remarkable for such a thing. Moreover, according to Houbigant's chronology, Booz and Obed must have
                           had children when they were almost 120, and Isai in his 107th year. But by admitting Salma and Jachin, the five persons might
                           each have sons when they were about seventy, and thus would complete 347 years. See chap. ii. 1. (Haydock).</FONT></FONT></P>

                           before Saul. (Calmet) --- Thus the greatest personages have people of mean condition among their ancestors, that none may
                           be too much elated on account of their high birth. Ruth, notwithstanding her poverty, was a striking figure of the Christian
                           Church. (Haydock) --- The Gentiles were <I>strangers</I> to Christ, on account of their errors, but related to him in as much
                           as they were his creatures. Their miserable condition pleaded hard for them, that Jesus would receive them under his protection,
                           espouse and give them rest and peace. Booz would not marry Ruth till the nearer relation had refused, and thus brought dishonour
                           on himself; (Deuteronomy xxv.) so Jesus was principally sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and did not send his
                           apostles to the Gentiles till the Jews had rejected their ministry. (Calmet) --- See St. Ambrose, de fide, iii. 5. (Du Hamel)

                                    it, and possess it: But if it please thee not, tell me so, that I may know what I have to do. For there is no near kinsman
                                    besides thee, who art first, and me, who am second. But he answered: I will buy the field.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And Booz said to him: When thou shalt buy the field at the woman's

                                    inheritance.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 He answered: I yield up my right of next akin: for I must not cut off
                                    the posterity of my own family. Do thou make use of my privilege, which I profess I do willingly forego.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 *Now this in former times was the manner in Israel between kinsmen,
                                    that if at any time one yielded his right to another: that the grant might be sure, the man put off his shoe, and gave it
                                    to his neighhour; this was a testimony of cession of right in Israel.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 So Booz said to his kinsman: Put off thy shoe. And immediately he took

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And he said to the ancients, and to all the people: You are witnesses
                                    this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and Chelion's, and Mahalon's, of the hand of Noemi:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And have taken to wife Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of Mahalon, to
                                    raise up the name of the deceased in his inheritance, lest his name be cut off, from among his family and his brethren, and
                                    his people. You, I say, are witnesses of this thing.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 Then all the people that were in the gate, and the ancients, answered:
                                    We are witnesses: The Lord make this woman who cometh into thy house, like Rachel, and Lia, who built up the house of Israel:
                                    that she may be an example of virtue in Ephrata, and may have a famous name in Bethlehem:</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 Booz therefore took Ruth, and married her: and went in unto her, and
                                    the Lord gave her to conceive, and to bear a son.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And the women said to Noemi: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not suffered
