                                    <P>1 Against *Moab thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe to Nabo, for it is laid waste, and confounded: Cariathaim
                                    is taken: the strong city is confounded, and hath trembled.</P>
                                    <P>2 There is no more rejoicing in Moab over Hesebon: they have devised evil. Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation.
                                    Therefore, shalt thou in silence hold thy peace, and the sword shall follow thee.</P>
                                    <P>3 A voice of crying from Oronaim: waste and great destruction.</P>
                                    <P>4 Moab is destroyed; proclaim a cry for her little ones.</P>
                                    <P>5 For by the ascent of Luith shall the mourner go up with weeping; for in the descent of Oronaim, the enemies have heard
                                    a howling of destruction:</P>
                                    <P>6 Flee, save your lives; and be *as heath in the wilderness.</P>
                                    <P>7 For because thou hast trusted in thy bulwarks, and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken; and Chamos shall go into
                                    captivity, his priests, and his princes together.</P>
                                    <P>8 And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; and the valleys shall perish, and the plains shall
                                    be destroyed, for the Lord hath spoken:</P>
                                    <P>9 Give a flower to Moab, for in its flower it shall go out; and the cities thereof shall be desolate, and uninhabited.</P>
                                    <P>10 Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully; and cursed be he that withholdeth his sword from blood.</P>
                                    <P>11 Moab hath been fruitful from his youth, and hath rested upon his lees; and hath not been poured out from vessel to vessel,
                                    nor hath gone into captivity: therefore his taste hath remained in him, and his scent is not changed.</P>
                                    <P>12 Therefore, behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send him men that shall order and overturn his bottles,
                                    and they shall cast him down, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles one against another.</P>
                                    <P>13 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, *as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, in which they trusted.</P>
                                    <P>14 *How do you say: We are valiant, and stout men in battle?</P>
                                    <P>15 Moab is laid waste, and they have cast down her cities; and her choice young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith
                                    the king, whose name is the Lord of hosts.</P>
                                    <P>16 The destruction of Moab is near to come: the calamity thereof shall come on exceeding swiftly.</P>
                                    <P>17 Comfort him, all you that are round about him; and all you that know his name, say: How is the strong staff broken,
                                    the beautiful rod?</P>
                                    <P>18 Come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst, O dwelling of the daughter of Dibon; because the spoiler of Moab is come
                                    up to thee, he hath destroyed thy bulwarks.</P>
                                    <P>19 Stand in the way, and look out, O habitation of Aroer: enquire of him that fleeth, and say to him that hath escaped:
                                    What Is done?</P>
                                    <P>20 Moab is confounded, because he is overthrown: howl ye, and cry, tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is wasted.</P>
                                    <P>21 And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Helon, and upon Jasa, and upon Mephaath;</P>
                                    <P>22 And upon Dibon, and upon Nabo, and upon the house of Deblathaim;</P>
                                    <P>23 And upon Cariathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmaon;</P>
                                    <P>24 And upon Carioth, and upon Bosra, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.</P>
                                    <P>25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the Lord.</P>
                                    <P>26 Make him drunk, because he lifted up himself against the Lord; and Moab shall dash his hand in his own vomit, and he
                                    also shall be in derision.</P>
                                    <P>27 For Israel hath been a derision unto thee: as though thou hadst found him amongst thieves: for thy words, therefore,
                                    which thou hast spoken against him, thou shalt be led away captive.</P>
                                    <P>28 Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, you that dwell in Moab; and be ye Iike the dove, that maketh her nest in the
                                    mouth of the hole in the highest place.</P>
                                    <P>29 *We have heard the pride of Moab; he is exceedingly proud; his haughtiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the
                                    loftiness of his heart.</P>
                                    <P>30 I know, saith the Lord, his boasting: and that the strength thereof is not according to it, neither hath it endeavoured
                                    to do according as it was able.</P>
                                    <P>31 Therefore will I lament for Moab, and I will cry out to all Moab, for the men of the brick wall that mourn.</P>
                                    <P>32 O vineyard of Sabama, I will weep for thee, with the mourning of Jazer; thy branches are gone over the sea, they are
                                    come even to the sea of Jazer: the robber hath rushed in upon thy harvest, and thy vintage.</P>
                                    <P>33 *Joy and gladness is taken away from Carmel, and from the land of Moab, and I have taken away the wine out of the presses:
                                    the treader of the grapes shall not sing the accustomed cheerful tune.</P>
                                    <P>34 From the cry of Hesebon, even to Eleale, and to Jasa, they have uttered their voice; from Segor to Oronaim, <I>as </I>a
                                    heifer of three years old; the waters also of Nemrin shall be very bad.</P>
                                    <P>35 And I will take away from Moab, saith the Lord, him that offereth in the high places, and that sacrificeth to his gods.</P>
                                    <P>36 Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes; and my heart a sound like pipes for the men of the brick wall; because
                                    he hath done more than he could, therefore they have perished.</P>
                                    <P>37 *For every head <I>shall be</I> bald, and every beard shall be shaven: all hands shall be tied together, and upon every
                                    back there shall be haircloth.</P>
                                    <P>38 Upon all the house-tops of Moab, and in the streets thereof general mourning; because I have broken Moab as an useless
                                    vessel, saith the Lord.</P>
                                    <P>39 How is it overthrown, and they have howled? How hath Moab bowed down the neck, and is confounded? And Moab shall be
                                    a derision, and an example to all round about him.</P>
                                    <P>40 Thus saith the Lord: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall stretch forth his wings to Moab.</P>
                                    <P>41 Carioth is taken, and the strong holds are won: and the heart of the valiant men of Moab, in that day, shall be as the
                                    heart of a woman in labour.</P>
                                    <P>42 And Moab shall cease to be a people: because he hath gloried against the Lord.</P>
                                    <P>43 Fear, and the pit, and the snare <I>come </I>upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the Lord.</P>
                                    <P>44 *He that shall flee from the fear, shall fall into the pit; and he that shall get up out of the pit, shall be taken
                                    in the snare; for I will bring upon Moab the year of their visitation, saith the Lord.</P>
                                    <P>45 They that fled from the snare stood in the shadow of Hesebon, but there came a fire out of Hesebon, and a flame out
                                    of the midst of Seon, and it shall devour part of Moab, and the crown of the head of the children of tumult.</P>
                                    <P>46 Woe to thee, Moab, thou hast perished, O people of Chamos; for thy sons, and thy daughters are taken captives.</P>
                                    <P>47 And I will bring back the captivity of Moab in the last days, saith the Lord. Hitherto the judgments of Moab.</P>
