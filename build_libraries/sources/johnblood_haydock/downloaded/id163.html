                           Paul less commendable. It is natural to every man to fear persecutions and torments. We admire the apostle, who amidst these
                           fears, was always ready to expose himself, was always fighting, and always victorious. (Witham) --- During the stay I made
                           with you at Corinth, I saw myself daily exposed to injuries, affronts, and persecutions. I had then the opportunity of practising
                           the lessons which our expiring Redeemer delivered to us from the wood on which he died, and the daily contradictions I met
                           with obliged me to think of other things than fine discourses, and elegant harangues. (Theophylactus)</FONT></P><B>

                           of our religion: we therefore preached to you Christ crucified; (Calmet) but to the true perfect disciples of Christ we reveal
                           the most sacred mysteries. (St. Chrysostom) --- By wisdom, here seems to be understood a more sublime doctrine concerning
                           the most abstruse mysteries of faith, which the ignorant could not understand. To the same purpose he tells them in the next
                           chapter and in the 5th chapter to the Hebrews, that <I>milk</I> is the proper food of little children, not <I>solid meat,</I>
                           which is proper <I>for those that are perfect.</I> --- <I>Yet</I> we speak <I>not the wisdom of this world,</I> nor of the

                           wisdom, but folly by them, who pretend to worldly wisdom. --- <I>We speak</I> then in a mystery, or after a mysterious manner,
                           according to the capacity of those that hear us, the <I>great wisdom of God,</I> which <I>hidden,</I> and not understood by
                           the wise men of this world, God hath manifested by the incarnation of his Son, and by our redemption; which mystery, and which
                           wisdom, <I>none of the princes of this world knew,</I> that is, the devils, according to the common interpretation; or Pilate,
                           Herod, Caiphas, &amp;c. according to St. Chrysostom, <I>or they would never have crucified,</I> nor have permitted others
                           to crucify, <I>the Lord of glory,</I> Jesus Christ, who by his divine person is truly the Lord of glory. See St. Augustine,
                           lib. i. de Trin. chap. 12. &amp;c. He may also be called the <I>Lord of glory,</I> because of that glory, which from eternity
                           he predestinated, and decreed to give his elect; and of which it is written, that <I>the eye hath not seen,</I> &amp;c. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           out of the revealed Scriptures, &amp;c. (Witham) --- St. Paul seems in this place to answer an objection that might be brought
                           against him. If, as you say, you are gifted with a knowledge of mysteries, who do you not reveal those mysteries to us? To
                           this he seems to answer, because to spiritual persons, we impart spiritual knowledge. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           his eternal salvation. --- <I>And he himself is judged by no one,</I> that is, by no one, who is not spiritual, or who is
                           not taught by the Spirit of God, to pass a right judgment: the sense also may be, that he cannot be justly blamed or condemned
                           by any worldly man, who knows not how to judge of such spiritual things. (Witham) --- The sensual man is either he who is
                           taken up with sensual pleasures, with carnal and worldly affections: or he who measureth divine mysteries by natural reason,
                           sense, and human wisdom only. Now such a man has little or no notion of the things of God. Whereas the spiritual man, in the
                           mysteries of religion, takes not human sense for his guide; but submits his judgment to the decisions of the Church, which
                           he is commanded to hear and obey. For Christ hath promised to remain to the end of the world with his Church, and to direct
                           her in all things by the Spirit of truth. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           whom he guides by his spirit. --- <I>But we,</I> whom he has chosen to be his apostles, <I>have the mind of Christ;</I> having
                           been taught and instructed by the Spirit of Christ. Some enthusiasts and fanatics pretend from this passage of St. Paul, that
                           they being led and inspired by the spirit, <I>can be judged by no one</I> in matters of faith and religion. <I>They</I> pervert
                           and <I>wrest</I> the words of St. Paul, <I>as they do also other Scriptures,</I> to their <I>own perdition.</I> (2 Peter iii.
                           16.) First, because no one knows by his pretended private spirit, that he is truly such a spiritual man, who has the Spirit
                           of God in him: and many have too much reason to know by their sensual carnal lives, that they have it not. Secondly, St. Paul
                           here speaks only of spiritual men in opposition to sensual men, and only says that they who are spiritual, have the spirit
                           of discretion to judge what things are spiritual, and what are not; and that none can judge rightly of these matters, but
                           they who are spiritual, guided by the Spirit. Thirdly, as to controversies about religion, the proper spiritual judges appointed
                           by our Saviour, Christ, are the bishops, whom he has appointed to govern his Church, with an entire submission of every man's
                           private judgment, and private spirit, to the judgment of the Catholic Church, which he has commanded us to hear and obey,
                           with which he has promised to remain to the end of the world, and to direct her in all things by the spirit of truth. (Witham)</FONT></P></FONT><FONT
