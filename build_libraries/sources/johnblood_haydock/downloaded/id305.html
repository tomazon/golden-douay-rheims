                           praises of God in heaven. Here in the Protestant translation, are retained <i>Alleluia</i> and <i>Amen,</i> which as St. Augustine
                           takes notice, used not to be changed nor translated in any language. (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           strength may be compared to the voice of rushing waters, and because of the terror with which it strikes the wicked. Pastorini
                           understands by this <i>voice of many waters,</i> the voices of many Angels that preside over the nations, denoted by <i>waters,</i>
                           which had all before groaned under the tyranny of antichrist; and the <i>voice of great thunders,</i> that of the Angel who
                           presides over fire, which, as employed in military engines, by its explosion resembles thunder. It must be observed that the
                           latter author refers it to the last stage of the world.</font></p><b>

                           <em>And I fell before his feet, to adore him</em>.[1] They of the pretended reformation think they have here a clear proof
                           that no veneration is due to Angels and saints, and that papists in so doing are idolaters. In answer to this: First, they
                           make St. John the apostle guilty of that idolatry which they lay to our charge. For they must suppose and grant that St. John,
                           as to the dispositions of his mind and will, was just ready, or rather falling down, did pay an idolatrous worship to the
                           Angel; and what Christian can believe this of so great an apostle, that after he had been favoured with all those extraordinary
                           visions, he should either be so very ignorant as not to know what was idolatry, or so impious as to become guilty of it, and
                           give divine honour to any creature? And what makes St. John altogether inexcusable, (had it been idolatry) we find him doing
                           the very same a second time, in the last chapter of the Apocalypse; (ver. 7 and 8) that is, falling <i>down</i> at the Angel's
                           feet to <i>adore.</i> Secondly, as it would be extravagantly unreasonable to suspect this apostle, this evangelist, this prophet
                           of the new law, to be guilty of what every Christian, every Jew knows to be&nbsp; idolatry; to wit, to give the divine honour
                           due to God alone to any creature whatsoever; so in reason we cannot but conclude that he was not for giving divine honour
                           to any Angel, knowing them all to be God's creatures. If therefore he was about to pay divine honour, we must either say that
                           he took him who then appeared to him to be our Saviour Christ, God and man, as some expound it; or, which seems more probable,
                           he was only for offering an inferior honour and veneration to the Angel, such as he knew was lawful: and therefore he was
                           for doing it afterwards a second time; though the Angel would not receive it from St. John, to make us the more convinced
                           of the great dignity of this apostle and prophet, who should be raised in heaven to a degree of glory, not inferior to that
                           of the Angels: and thus the Angel tells him, that he is his fellow creature, who with him must adore Almighty God, that by
                           these prophecies they both bear testimony concerning Jesus Christ and his Church, the Angel by revealing them, and St. John
                           by publishing them, which seems to be the sense of the following words, <i>for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy:</i>
                           or they may be expounded thus, for the testimony that we give concerning Christ and his Church, we both of us receive from
                           the divine spirit of God, who reveals such truths to his prophets. Thirdly, the Protestants are for proving us idolaters from
                           what St. John was about to do, or rather from what he did, expressed in these words, <i>and I fell before his feet to adore
                           him;</i> or, as in the Protestant translation, <i>and I fell at his feet to worship him.</i> Now it is certain and evident
                           that these words neither in the Latin nor in the Greek, express that divine worship and honour which is due, and which is
                           given to God alone, whether we consult the Hebrew or the Septuagint of the Old Testament, the very same words are many times
                           used to signify no more than an inferior honour given to creatures. This is a thing well known, and agreed upon by every Protestant
                           as well as Catholic, who has read the Scriptures, or who knows any thing of Latin, Greek, or Hebrew. Fourthly, it seems very
                           strange, very unaccountable, that our adversaries will not understand the difference betwixt divine honour due to God alone,
                           and an inferior honour, respect, or veneration given to Angels or saints, to their relics or images, which inferior honour
                           may, in some sense, be called a religious honour, inasmuch as it is paid to persons or things that may be called sacred or
                           holy. Is not honour or veneration certainly different, as the <i>objects</i> or things we pay honour to, and the intention
                           of him that pays this honour, are different, though perhaps the exterior marks of bowing, of kneeling, of prostrating, of
                           kissing, may be the same? We honour the king, and we also honour his courtiers, his officers, and such as are invested with
                           dignities and authority from him: but shall any one think that we pay the same honour to all these persons or things belonging
                           to them? though the eastern people kneel or prostrate themselves before kings or persons in dignities, they neither give nor
                           design to give them divine honour.&nbsp; Why will our adversaries pretend to make us idolaters against our wills, minds, and
                           intentions, when we have always protested that we give divine honour&nbsp;and supreme worship to God alone? that we honour,
                           worship, serve and adore him only as the author of all things? that we never design to pay any thing but an inferior honour
                           to the highest Angels or saints, or to their relics and images. We know, believe, and profess that there is an infinite distance
                           betwixt God the creator, and the highest and most perfect of all created beings; so that the honour we give them is infinitely
                           inferior, as they themselves are, to the honour that with our hearts and minds we pay to God: and must it be said that we
                           give divine honour to creatures, and so become idolaters, when we&nbsp;never design it, when we design quite the contrary?
                           This made Mr. Thorndike, in his book of just weights and measures, tell his Protestant brethren, that the Church of Rome cannot
                           be charged with idolatry for their reverencing images, nor on any other account; and so exhorts them not to pretend to lead
                           the people by the nose, to make them believe suppositions which they cannot prove. See Chap. ii. and xix. (Witham) --- <i>Fell
                           before,</i> &amp;c. St. Athanasius and St. Augustine think St. John took the Angel to be Jesus Christ, and as such was desirous
                           of paying him the supreme homage, or&nbsp;<i><u>latreia</u>.</i> (Calmet) --- St. John, in token of gratitude, offers to pay
                           to the Angel such homage as is due to a being of his rank, which the Angel however refuses to accept, giving for reason, that
                           his is <i>a fellow-servant</i> of the apostle, and of the apostle's <i>brethren,</i> who bear <i>testimony</i> to Jesus Christ.
                           (Pastorini) --- This speech evidently agrees with the character of John the Baptist, but not with that of a real Angel. ---
                           <i>Testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</i> The testimony which you give to Christ, by suffering for his holy name
                           and the profession of his doctrine, is of equal value with the <i>spirit of prophecy</i> which I possess (Pastorini; Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           still obtains among the Orientals, of having a secret name, which they discover to no one. (Calmet) --- Pastorini understands
                           this to be the name of the <i>word of God,</i> as mentioned in the subsequent verse; which is so comprehensive in its meaning,
                           that human reason cannot fathom it, <i>and no man knoweth but himself.</i></font></font></p><b>

                           aliquem orare, says Erasmus, capite vel corpore inclinato. We have very many examples in the holy Scripture, where both&nbsp;<i><u>proskunein</u></i>
                           and&nbsp;<i><u>latreuein</u></i> signify not only divine honour, but also the honour paid to men. When God gave the ten commandments,
                           (Exodus xx.) he forbad his people to adore strange gods; non adorabis ea, neque coles;&nbsp;<i><u>ou proskuneseis autois,
                           oude me latreuseis autois</u>.</i> Yet the same words are used in a great many places, where it is evident that no divine
                           adoration or worship was designed, as we read of Abraham, (Genesis xxvii. 7.) adoravit populum terræ,<i>&nbsp;<u>prosekunese
                           to lao tes ges</u>;</i> Genesis xlii. 6. of Joseph's brethren, cum adorassent eum fratres sui,&nbsp;<i><u>prosekunesan auto
                           epi prosopon</u>.</i> See also 1 Kings xx. 41. where David is said to have adored Jonathan, cadens pronus in terram adoravit,&nbsp;<i><u>epesen
                           epi prosopon kai prosekunesen auto tris</u>.</i> See likewise 3 Kings i. 16. where Bethsabee[Bathsheba] is said to have adored
                           old king David, adoravit regem,&nbsp;<i><u>prosekunese to basilei</u>.</i> Though in these and many other places be the same
                           expressions as when St. John is here said to have fallen at the angel's feet to adore him, or worship him, yet no one can
                           think that in these places is meant the supreme worship due to God alone: did Bathsabee take her old, decayed, dying husband,
                           David, to be God, or design to pay him divine honour? Nothing then is more frivolous than such arguments drawn from the like
                           words, which have different significations.</font></p></font><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>
