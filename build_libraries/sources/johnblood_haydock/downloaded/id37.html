                           it lawful?</I> Here again the Pharisees, ever anxious to ensnare Jesus in his words, come to him and ask him, is it lawful
                           for a man to put away his wife for every cause? Thinking now they had to a certainty succeeded, they argue thus with themselves:
                           shall he say that it is not lawful, we will accuse him of blasphemy, contradicting the Scriptures. For, it is written, Deuteronomy
                           iv.[xxiv.?] 1, <I>If a man take a wife, and she find not favour in his eyes, for some uncleanness, he shall write a bill of
                           divorce.&nbsp;</I>And Malachias, ii. 16, <I>When thou shalt hate her, put her away.</I> --- On the other hand, if he shall
                           say it is lawful, we will accuse him of favouring the passions. But Jesus Christ, the wisdom of the eternal Father, silences
                           them with the authority of that Scripture they attempted to bring against him. <I>What God has joined together, let no man
                           put asunder;</I> intimating, that the connexion between husband and wife is so strict, that by it they become as one flesh,
                           and can no more be separated than one member from another. (Denis the Carthusian) --- <I>To put away his wife for every cause,</I>[1]
                           or upon every occasion. They did not doubt it, if the cause was considerable. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           poison them, or put them to violent death; but in the natural law, signified by <I>the beginning,</I> it was not so. (Denis

                           man who was divorced from his wife could marry another woman, is disputed. Some think this second marriage was still <FONT

                           part of this verse, of St. Paul, (Romans vii. 3,) and the constant tradition of the Church, shew that the exception only refers
                           to separation, but not to the marrying another during the life of the parties. In this place Christ restores the original
                           condition of the marriage state, and henceforth will have it to be a perfect figure of the hypostatic union of his divine
                           person with our human nature, as also of his nuptial union with his Church, and consequently that it should be indissoluble.
                           (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           I say to you.</I> It is worthy of remark, that in the parallel texts, St. Mark x. 2. and St. Luke xvi. 18. and St. Paul to
                           Corinthians vii. 10. omit the exception of fornication; and also that St. Matthew himself omits it in the second part of the
                           verse; and says absolutely, that he who shall marry her that is put away committeth adultery. It perhaps crept in here from
                           chap. v. 32, where it is found in a phrase very similar to this, but which expresses a case widely different. Divorce is in
                           no case admitted but in that of adultery. This is what Christ teaches in chap. v. 32, and to this the exception is referred,
                           marked in the two texts. But in this very case the separated parties cannot contract a second marriage without again committing
                           adultery, as we must infer, from a comparison of this text with the parallel texts of St. Mark and St. Luke. (Bible de Vence)
                           --- If we did not understand it in this manner, the case of the adulteress would be preferable to the case of her who should
                           be put away without any crime of her own; as in this supposition, the former would be allowed to marry again, which the latter
                           would not be allowed. (Tirinus) --- St. Augustine is very explicit on this subject. See lib. 11. de adult conjug. chap. xxi.
                           xxii. xxiv. --- St. Jerome, in his high commendation of the noble matron, Fabiola, says of her: "that though she was the innocent
                           party, for the unlawful act of marrying again, she did public penance." (In Epitaph. Fabiolæ.) --- This universally received
                           doctrine of the Catholic Church was confirmed in the general council of Trent. (Session xxiv. canon 6.)</FONT></P><B>

                           receive not this word.</I>[3] To translate all <I>cannot</I> take, or cannot receive this word, is neither conformable to
                           the Latin nor Greek text. To be able to live singly, and chastely, is given to every one that asketh, and prayeth for the
                           grace of God to enable him to live so. (Witham) --- Jesus Christ takes occasion from the remark of the Pharisees to praise
                           holy virginity, which he represents as a great and good gift of heaven; and such it has ever been considered in the eye of
                           true and genuine religion. Hence it appears that besides commandments, there are evangelical counsels, to the observance of
                           which it is both lawful and meritorious for a Christian to devote himself, especially for the purpose of employing himself
                           with greater liberty and less encumbrance in the service of his God. --- Our Lord does not approve of the conclusion his disciples
                           drew from his doctrine on the indissolubility of marriage, lest he should seem to condemn matrimony both good and necessary;
                           neither does he reprove them for it, lest he should seem to prefer it before the state of continency. His answer therefore
                           prudently avoids both difficulties, by seeming to grant, on the one hand, that it was more expedient not to marry, because
                           chastity is a great gift of God; (1 Corinthians vii.) and plainly shewing on the other, that only few can have this privilege,
                           because <I>all do not receive this word,</I> i.e. all are not called to this state. (Jansenius) --- All cannot receive it,
                           because all do not wish it. The reward is held out to all. Let him who seeks for glory, not think of the labour. None would
                           overcome, if all were afraid of engaging in the conflict. If some fail, are we to be less careful in our pursuit of virtue?
                           Is the soldier terrified, because his comrade fights and falls by his side? (St. Chrysostom) --- He that can receive it, let
                           him receive it. He that can fight, let him fight, overcome and triumph. It is the voice of the Lord animating his soldiers
                           to victory. (St. Jerome)</FONT></P><B>

                           Some think that to <I>receive,</I> in this and the foregoing verse, is to <I>understand;</I> and so will have the sense to

                           little ones, the fruits of lawful wedlock; and declares that the kingdom of heaven is the portion of such as resemble these
                           little ones, by the innocence of their lives and simplicity of their hearts. He, moreover, shews that confidence in our own
                           strength, in our own free-will, and in our merits, is an invincible obstacle to salvation. St. Mark (x. 16) says, that embracing
                           them, and laying hands upon them, he blessed them. Hence probably arose the ancient custom of presenting children to bishops
                           and priests, to receive their blessing, beside that of confirmation immediately after baptism. --- Nicephorus tells us that
                           the celebrated St. Ignatius, afterwards bishop of Antioch, was one of these children who, on this occasion, received Christ's
                           blessing. --- If we would enter into the kingdom of heaven, we must imitate the virtues of little children. Their souls are
                           free from every passion; void of every thought of revenge, they approach those who have grieved them as to their best friends.
                           Though the parent repeatedly chastise his child, it still will adhere to him, still will it love him, and prefer him in all
                           his poverty to all the fascinating charms of dazzling gold and purple. They seek not beyond what is necessary, they admire
                           not the beauty of the body, they are not grieved at the loss of worldly wealth, therefore does the Saviour of the world say,
                           that theirs is the kingdom of heaven. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxiii.)</FONT></P><B>

                           appears not to have believed that Christ was God: wherefore our Saviour, to rectify his misconception, tells him that God
                           alone is good, insinuating thereby, that he should believe him to be God, or cease to address him by the title of good. (Tirinus)
                           --- The sense is, that only God is good <I>necessarily,</I> and by his own nature. The Arians bring this place to shew, that
                           Christ is not truly and properly God: but by this way of speaking, Christ does not deny that he is good, even by his nature,
                           and consequently God; but seems to speak in this manner, to make the man know who he was. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           this state of life hath a great reward in heaven. This state, we learn from St. Augustine, the apostles followed; and he himself
                           not only embraced it, but exhorted as many others as he possibly could to embrace it. (St. Augustine, ep. lxxxix, <I>in fine,</I>
                           and in Ps. ciii. conc. 3. post. med.) (Bristow) --- The whole perfection of a Christian life consists in following Christ,
                           by an imitation of his virtues. So that he who possesses poverty and chastity, does not immediately become perfect, but only
                           enters upon the way of perfection, by facilitating his progress to perfection, removing hindrances, and laying aside all care
                           of temporal concerns. (Nicholas of Lyra.) --- In this chapter Jesus Christ delivers the evangelical counsels. In ver. 12,
                           he recommends continency---here he proposes voluntary poverty, and immediately adds that of obedience, <I>follow me.</I> St.
                           Augustine teaches, that the apostles bound themselves by vow to the observance of these three counsels. (De civit. Dei. Book

                           with how great affection we love what we already have, and how earnestly we search after what we have not? It is on this account
                           that St. Peter, and his brother, St. Andrew, left much, because they denied themselves even the desire and inclination of
