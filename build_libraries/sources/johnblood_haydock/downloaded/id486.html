                           The Scripture does not specify how nearly they were related. Rabbi Josue says Elimelech, Salmon, and Tob (chap. iii. 13,)
                           were brothers, and Booz was the son of Salmon, which cannot be refuted, (Serar. q. 1.; Menochius) though the authority and
                           proofs be very weak. It is not, however, more probable that Booz was the <I>brother</I> of Elimelech. Some think that he was
                           not the immediate son of Salmon, as four persons seem too few to fill up the space of 366 years, from the marriage of Rahab
                           till the birth of David. But this is not impossible. (Calmet) See chap. iv. 20.</FONT></P><B></B>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 She went, therefore, and gleaned the ears of corn after the reapers.
                                    And it happened that the owner of that field was Booz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 And behold, he came out of Bethlehem, and said to the reapers: The

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And he answered him: This is the Moabitess, who came with Noemi, from

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And she desired leave to glean the ears of corn that remain, following
                                    the steps of the reapers: and she hath been in the field from morning till now, and hath not gone home for one moment.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And Booz said to Ruth: Hear me, daughter, do not go to glean in any
                                    other field, and do not depart from this place: but keep with my maids,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And follow where they reap. For I have charged my young men, not to
                                    molest thee: and if thou art thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of the waters whereof the servants drink.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 She fell on her face, and worshipping upon the ground, said to him:

                                    a woman of another country?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And he answered her: All hath been told me, that thou hast done to
                                    thy mother-in-law after the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left thy parents, and the land wherein thou wast born,
                                    and art come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 The Lord render unto thee for thy work, and mayst thou receive a full
                                    reward of the Lord the God of Israel, to whom thou art come, and under whose wings thou art fled.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And she said: I have found grace in thy eyes, my lord, who hast comforted
                                    me, and hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, who am not like to one of thy maids.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And Booz said to her: At meal-time come thou hither, and eat of the
                                    bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. So she sat at the side of the reapers, and she heaped to herself frumenty, and ate
                                    and was filled, and took the leavings.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And she arose from thence, to glean the ears of corn as before. And
                                    Booz commanded his servants, saying: If she would even reap with you, hinder her not:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And let fall some of your handfuls of purpose, and leave them, that
                                    she may gather them without shame, and let no man rebuke her when she gathereth them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 She gleaned therefore in the field till evening: and beating out with
                                    a rod, and threshing what she had gleaned, she found about the measure of an ephi of barley, that is, three bushels:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Which she took up, and returned into the city, and shewed it to her
                                    mother-in-law: moreover, she brought out, and gave her of the remains of her meat, wherewith she had been filled.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And her mother-in-law said to her: Where hast thou gleaned to-day,
                                    and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that hath had pity on thee. And she told her with whom she had wrought: and she
                                    told the man's name, that he was called Booz.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And Noemi answered her: Blessed be he of the Lord: because the same
                                    kindness which he shewed to the living, he hath kept also to the dead. And again she said: The man is our kinsman.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And Ruth said: He also charged me, that I should keep close to his
                                    reapers, till all the corn should be reaped.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And her mother-in-law said to her: It is better for thee, my daughter,
                                    to go out to reap with his maids, lest in another man's field some one may resist thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 So she kept close to the maids of Booz: and continued to glean with
