                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And king Assuerus answered Esther, the queen, and Mardochai, the Jew:
                                    I have given Aman's house to Esther, and I have commanded him to be hanged on a gibbet, because he durst lay hands on the
                                    Jews.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 Write ye, therefore, to the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king's
                                    name, and seal the letters with my ring. For this was the custom, that no man durst gainsay the letters which were sent in
                                    the king's name, and were sealed with his ring.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Then the king's scribes and secretaries were called for (now it was
                                    the time of the third month, which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day of the month, and letters were written, as
                                    Mardochai had a mind, to the Jews, and to the governors, and to the deputies, and to the judges, who were rulers over the
                                    hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia: to province and province, to people and people, according
                                    to their languages and characters, and to the Jews, according as they could read and hear.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And these letters which were sent in the king's name, were sealed
                                    with his ring, and sent by posts: who were to run through all the provinces, to prevent the former letters with new messages.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And the king gave orders to them, to speak to the Jews in every city,
                                    and to command them to gather themselves together, and to stand for their lives, and to kill and destroy all their enemies,
                                    with their wives and children and all their houses, and to take their spoil.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And one day of revenge was appointed through all the provinces, to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And this was the content of the letter, that it should be notified
                                    in all lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of king Assuerus, that the Jews were ready to be revenged of their

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 So the swift posts went out carrying the messages, and the king's

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And Mardochai going forth out of the palace, and from the king's presence,
                                    shone in royal apparel, to wit, of violet and sky-colour, wearing a golden crown on his head, and clothed with a cloak of
                                    silk and purple. And all the city rejoiced and was glad.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 But to the Jews a new light seemed to rise, joy, honour, and dancing.</font></p>

                                    and religion, joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies. For a great dread of the name of the Jews had fallen upon
