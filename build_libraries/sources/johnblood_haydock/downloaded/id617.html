                           for Gabaa signifieth a hill. (Challoner) (1 Paralipomenon xiii. 6.) --- It was perhaps the citadel, (Haydock) or an elevated
                           situation, such as were generally chosen for the temples both of the true and of false gods. (Calmet) --- <i>Abinadab</i>
                           was a Levite of renowned virtue. (Menochius) --- The people of this city knew that the ark was a source of blessings to those
                           who received it with respect; and, that the Bethsamites had been punished only for their irreverence. (Worthington) --- Samuel
                           was first consulted before the people, in a body, undertook to remove the ark; and here he was probably recognized for the
                           judge of Israel, in which character he henceforward appears, exhorting all to obey the Lord with sincerity. He appoints a
                           general assembly at Masphath, to enter into a solemn covenant with the Lord, and to adopt means for recovering their liberty.
                           We have only a very concise account of these important transactions, owing to the modesty of the author, which the Holy Spirit
                           would teach us to imitate. (Calmet) --- <i>Sanctified.</i> Chaldean, "set over," (Menochius) prepared by suitable purifications,
                           &amp;c. (Calmet) --- Some think, that Eleazar received the priestly or the Levitical consecration, Numbers viii. 7. We have
                           no proof that he was of the family of Aaron, nor does his name occur in the genealogies of the Levites, as they are perhaps
                           too short. Josephus ([Antiquities?] vi. 2.) asserts that he was a Levite. (Calmet) --- But even a laic, like Obededon of Geth,
                           might have been the guardian of the ark, as he would not have to touch it. (Salien, the year before Christ 1112) --- Eleazar
                           had two brothers, who acted in the same capacity when David intended to remove the ark to Sion. At that time he was perhaps
                           dead, or decrepit, as his father might be on this occasion. (Haydock) --- It is not improbable but they were of the race of
                           Aaron. (Tirinus)</font></p><b style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small; ">

                           subsequent events from this period. But is it credible that Samuel should neglect for twenty years to make this exhortation
                           to the people? and how will it be true, that God humbled the Philistines during the whole time (Calmet) of his administration,
                           which perhaps (Haydock) only lasted so many years? (ver. 13.) (Calmet) --- It is more probable, therefore, that the power
                           of the enemy was broken by the destruction caused by the presence of the ark, which kept them under due restraint for a long
                           time; and when they attempted, once more, to molest the Israelites, they were entirely discomfited by a miraculous storm,
                           at the prayer of Samuel, ver. 10. Salien (the year of the world 2960) allows, that this took place in the twentieth year since
                           the ark came to Cariathiarim, in which year Samuel appointed his children judges at Bersabee, though he continued to act,
                           and was judge for twenty-three years, (some say thirty-eight) and even under the reign of Saul had almost an absolute sway,
                           as the prophet of the Lord. (Haydock) --- <i>Rested:</i> continued steadfast, (Santius) "cried unto," (Pagnin) "Looked (Haydock)
                           <i>or</i> returned," Septuagint. "Lamented after the Lord," Hebrew. (Menochius) --- They were not soon induced to break this
                           solemn covenant, Isaias vii. 2. (Tirinus)</font></p><b style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

                           (Calmet) and on many other occasions, this was the theme of his discourse to the Israelites, pressing them to cease from doing
                           evil, and to perform good works. (Haydock) --- Thus he preached every year in the different cities, ver. 16. (Lyranus) ---
                           <i>Astaroth.</i> These were the principal idols of the country, (Salien; Judges ii. 11.) under which all the others were included.
                           (Menochius) --- <i>Prepare.</i> God lays this injunction upon us, to remind us of our liberty, and we beg that he would convert
                           us, acknowledging the necessity of his grace. (Calmet) --- "God does not require impossibilities, but by his command, admonishes
                           thee to do what thou canst, and to pray for what thou art not able to perform, and he assists thee, that thou mayst be able
                           to perform it." (Council of Trent, session vi., chap. 11.; St. Augustine, &amp;c.)</font></p><b style="font-family: Verdana,

                           faithless; (Sa) or a symbol that they rejected every vestige of idolatry, and every sin, with true repentance. (Sanctius)
                           (Tirinus) --- Water was also the most ancient species of libation, before honey, and afterwards wine were adopted. (Porphyrius)
                           --- Though the law did not prescribe it, there was no prohibition. On the last day of the feast of tabernacles, the people
                           went to the pool of Silo to fetch water, and to pour it out in the temple, as a libation to the Lord; and it is thought that
                           Jesus Christ alludes to this custom, John vii. 24. (Lamy, Introd.) See 2 Kings xxiii. 16. (Calmet) --- <i>Fasted.</i> They
                           confess their sins and do penance, while Samuel sits as judge, (Salien) and had been endeavouring for twenty years to excite

                           army only increases the greatness of the carnage, when the Lord enters the lists. (Haydock) --- The sacred penman speaks with
                           great modesty of this victory, which is nevertheless one of the most important recorded in Scripture. The Philistines could
                           not recover themselves for 20 years; they found it necessary to restore the cities which they had taken, (Calmet) to relinquish
                           the tribute, and to come to such conditions as Samuel imposed upon them. He suffered them, however, to keep possession of
                           some strong holds, such as Gabaa, from which they were expelled by Jonathan. Salien says in the 22d year of Samuel, and the
