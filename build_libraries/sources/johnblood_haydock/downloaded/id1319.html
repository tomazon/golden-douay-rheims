                           (ver. 39, 40., and chap. xxxi. 31.; Calmet) except those who embraced the true faith of Christ. At all times <i>one</i> religion
                           alone can be pleasing to God, (ver. 39.) and those who were saved under the old law, must have believed in a Redeemer to come,
                           as we must do in one already past. (Haydock) --- God would not suffer true believers to become extinct under the old law;

                           plain</i>) near Gaza, (Calmet) and the <i>Negeb</i> or <i>south</i> country, (Haydock) towards Arabia. Here the excellent
                           commentary of St. Jerome ends, to our great loss. (Calmet) --- It was perhaps his last work, undertaken after the twelve minor
                           and the other three great prophets. He never wrote on Baruch, on the epistle of Jeremias, the Greek parts of Daniel, &amp;c.,
                           as the Jews did not allow them to be canonical, and the point was not then decided. The Church styles St. Jerome "the greatest
                           doctor in expounding the sacred Scriptures," as he translated and illustrated the greatest part of them; (Haydock) and indeed
                           he seems to have been the best qualified for the undertaking, of all the fathers. (Du Pin) --- Hence we may lament the more
                           that we have not all his works in their genuine purity and perfection, as even the latest editions are very faulty, and proceed
                           upon a plan which the learned do not approve. See A. Butler, Kennicott, &amp;c. (Haydock)</font></p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>
