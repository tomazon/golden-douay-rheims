                           of the first word is added by St. Jerome, (Haydock) and denotes also "a running water;" (Menochius) whereas the Ephraimites
                           pronounced a word which signifies "a burden," not being able to utter properly <I>sh,</I> or schin, for which the substituted
                           <I>s,</I> or samec, sobloth. (Haydock) --- In the same natioin, a variety of pronunciation frequently distinguishes the inhabitants
                           of the different provinces. The Galileans were thus known from the rest of the Jews, Matthew xxvi. 23.</FONT></P><B>

                           have idly conjectured, that parts of his body were interred in different cities out of respect, or that they rotted off, in
                           punishment of the sacrifice of his daughter. (Munster) --- Grotius compares Jepthe with the renowned Viriatus. His character,
                           both in peace and war, deserves the highest commendations; and in many respects, he was a striking figure of Jesus Christ.
                           (Calmet) --- The uncertainty of his birth, and the subsequent persecution which he endured from his brethren, foreshewed the
                           deformity of the synagogues, and the conduct of the Jews (Haydock) towards their Messias, from whom alone they could expect
                           salvation. Hence they are forced to have recourse to him, as the Israelites found themselves under a necessity of recalling
                           Jepthe to lead them on to victory. Those who refused obedience to him, were deservedly exterminated, as the faithless Jews
                           were by the arms of the Romans. Whether the daughter of Jepthe was immolated, or only consecrated to God, we may discover
                           in her person a figure of the death and of the resurrection of our Saviour, who voluntarily made a sacrifice of his human
                           nature to the justice of his father. See St. Augustine, q. 49.; Serarius, q. 26. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           (in Mat. ii. 1,) believes that this judge was of a city in Zabulon, Josue xix. 15. (Menochius) --- In the 6th year of Abesan,
                           the Philistines compelled the Israelites to pay tribute, (chap. xiii. 1,) and Samson was born in the year of the world 2860.

                           (Calmet) --- The author supposes that Abdon reigned in peace. But it seems that he and the two others preceding him in the
