                           sought out. (Haydock) --- If we should consider only the dictates of clemency, we should think that the Jews were too eager
                           in their revenge. But when we reflect, that their enemies had intended to destroy them all, and to seize their effects, we
                           shall allow that they did not exceed the limits of justice, as they acted by royal authority, and abstained from touching
                           any effects of the deceased. (Calmet) --- In the capital, 800 men fell victims to their fury. But as the citizens of that
                           place were probably the most guilty, we must not imagine that other cities would be treated with the like severity. (Haydock)

                           37. (Haydock) --- None were obliged to keep more than one of these days, according to their respective dwellings. The 14th
                           was for the provinces, the 15th for the Jews of Susan, ver. 18. (Tirinus) (Calmet) (Worthington) --- Yet it would seem that
                           both <i>days</i> were enjoined, ver. 27, 28. (Haydock) --- The Jews still observe, them, as they gratify their vanity and
                           vindictive spirit. The 13th is kept a rigid fast, for all above sixteen, for twenty-four hours, during which they eat nothing.
                           (Calmet) --- If that day should be a sabbath, or its eve, they fast on the 11th or 12th. (Drusius) --- The day before the
                           festival they give alms to their poor brethren, enjoining them to consume the whole in making good cheer. Each person must
                           then contribute the half sicle, (Exodus xxx. 13.) which is bestowed on those who undertake a pilgrimage to the land of promise.
                           At night, when the feast commences, they light the lamps, and begin to read the Book of Esther, as soon as the stars appear.
                           They use an old parchment manuscript roll, and, in five places, the reader shouts with all his might, running over the names
                           of the ten sons of Aman with all haste, to shew that they all died in a moment. Whenever Aman is mentioned, the children beat
                           the benches with mallets; and formerly they used to strike at a stone, on which his name was cut, till it broke, ver. 31.
                           After the lecture, they take a repast at home. Early the next morning they return to the synagogue, and read the account of
                           Amalec from the Pentateuch, and repeat the Book of Esther, with the aforesaid ceremonies. The rest of the day they spend in
                           merriment. Their teachers allow them to drink till they are unable to distinguish the name of Aman from that of Mardochai.
                           (Basnage, vi. 15.) --- They also change clothes, in contradiction to the law; (Deuteronomy xxii. 5.) and were formerly accustomed
                           to crucify a man of straw, which they burnt with the cross, till Christian emperors put a stop to them; as it was concluded,
                           from their curses, &amp;c., that they had an eye to our Saviour. (Calmet) See chap. v. 14. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "and queen Esther, daughter of Aminadab, &amp;c.,...wrote all that they had done, and also the confirmation

                                    above, is called Adar, when all the Jews were designed to be massacred, and their enemies were greedy after their blood, the
                                    case being altered, the Jews began to have the upper hand, and to revenge themselves of their adversaries.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 And they gathered themselves together in every city, and town, and
                                    place, to lay their hands on their enemies, and their persecutors. And no one durst withstand them, for the fear of their
                                    power had gone through every people.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 And the judges of the provinces, and the governors, and lieutenants,
                                    and every one in dignity, that presided over every place and work, extolled the Jews, for fear of Mardochai:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 For they knew him to be prince of the palace, and to have great power:
                                    and the fame of his name increased daily, and was spread abroad through all men's mouths.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 So the Jews made a great slaughter of their enemies, and killed them,
                                    repaying according to what they had prepared to do to them:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 Insomuch that even in Susan they killed five hundred men, besides the
                                    ten sons of Aman, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews: whose names are these:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 Pharsandatha, and Delphon, and Esphatha,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And Phoratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And Phermesta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Jezatha.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And when they had slain them, they would not touch the spoils of their
                                    goods.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And presently the number of them that were killed in Susan was brought
                                    to the king.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And he said to the queen: The Jews have killed five hundred men in
                                    the city of Susan, besides the ten sons of Aman: how many dost thou think they have slain in all the provinces? What askest
                                    thou more, and what wilt thou have me to command to be done?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And she answered: If it please the king, let it be granted to the
                                    Jews, to do to-morrow, in Susan, as they have done to-day, and that the ten sons of Aman may be hanged upon gibbets.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And the king commanded that it should be so done. And forthwith the
                                    edict was hung up in Susan, and the ten sons of Aman were hanged.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And on the fourteenth day of the month Adar, the Jews gathered themselves
                                    together, and they killed in Susan, three hundred men: but they took not their substance.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 Moreover, through all the provinces which were subject to the king's
                                    dominion, the Jews stood for their lives, and slew their enemies and persecutors: insomuch that the number of them that were
                                    killed amounted to seventy-five thousand, and no man took any of their goods.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Now the thirteenth day of the month, Adar, was the first day with
                                    them all of the slaughter, and on the fourteenth day they left off. Which they ordained to be kept holyday, so that all times
                                    hereafter they should celebrate it with feasting, joy, and banquets.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 But they that were killing in the city of Susan, were employed in
                                    the slaughter on the thirteenth and fourteenth day of the same month: and on the fifteenth day they rested. And, therefore,
                                    they appointed that day to be a holyday of feasting and gladness.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 But those Jews that dwelt in towns, not walled, and in villages, appointed
                                    the fourteenth day of the month, Adar, for banquets and gladness, so as to rejoice on that day, and send one another portions
                                    of their banquets and meats.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And Mardochai wrote all these things, and sent them comprised in letters
                                    to the Jews that abode in all the king's provinces, both those that lay near, and those afar off,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 That they should receive the fourteenth and fifteenth day of the month,
                                    Adar, for holydays, and always, at the return of the year, should celebrate them with solemn honour:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 Because, on those days, the Jews revenged themselves of their enemies,
                                    and their mourning and sorrow were turned into mirth and joy, and that these should be days of feasting and gladness, in which
                                    they should send one to another portions of meats, and should give gifts to the poor.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And the Jews undertook to observe, with solemnity, all they had begun
                                    to do at that time, which Mardochai, by letters, had commanded to be done.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 For Aman, the son of Amadathi, of the race of Agag, the enemy and
                                    adversary of the Jews, had devised evil against them, to kill them, and destroy them: and had cast Phur, that is, the lot.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And, afterwards, Esther went in to the king, beseeching him that his
                                    endeavours might be made void by the king's letters: and the evil that he had intended against the Jews, might return upon
                                    his own head. And so both he and his sons were hanged upon gibbets.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And since that time, these days are called Phurim, that is, of lots:
                                    because Phur, that is, the lot, was cast into the urn. And all things that were done, are contained in the volume of this
                                    epistle, that is, of this book:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And the things that they suffered, and that were afterwards changed,
                                    the Jews took upon themselves and their seed, and upon all that had a mind to be joined to their religion, so that it should
                                    be lawful for none to pass these days without solemnity: which the writing testifieth, and certain times require, as the years
                                    continually succeed one another.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 These are the days which shall never be forgot: and which all provinces
                                    in the whole world shall celebrate throughout all generations: neither is there any city wherein the days of Phurim, that
                                    is, of lots, must not be observed by the Jews, and by their posterity, which is bound to these ceremonies.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And Esther, the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mardochai, the
                                    Jew, wrote also a second epistle, that with all diligence, this day should be established a festival for the time to come.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And they sent to all the Jews that were in the hundred and twenty-seven
                                    provinces of king Assuerus, that they should have peace and receive truth,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 And observe the days of lots, and celebrate them with joy in their
                                    proper time: as Mardochai and Esther had appointed, and they undertook them to be observed by themselves, and by their seed,
                                    fasts, and cries, and the days of lots,</font></p>
