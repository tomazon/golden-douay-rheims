                           <i>Bag,</i> (<i>cassidili</i>) resembling a wallet or pannier, for provisions. (Calmet) --- <i>Liver.</i> (Chap. vi. 8.) This
                           mystically represented the Passion of Christ, by which the devil is expelled from men's hearts. (St. Augustine, ser. 28, de
                           Sanct.; Prosper, promis. ii. c. 39.) (Worthington) --- Greek, "and he took the ashes of incense, and placed thereon the heart
                           of the fish and the liver, causing them to smoke. And when the devil perceived the odour, he fled to the highest parts of
                           Egypt, and the angel bound him," (Haydock) confining his malice to those deserts. Jesus Christ insinuates that the devil walks
                           through dry places, Matthew xii. 24. The angel was not seen to absent himself: (Calmet) --- This country was chosen as being
                           very remote from Media. (Houbigant) --- It was afterwards sanctified by the presence of many Christian solitaries. (Haydock)
                           --- Our adversaries laugh at this account. But surely Christ has used similar expressions of binding the devil, who cannot
                           molest people, when he is not present; (Houbigant) or do any thing without the divine permission, chap. vi. 17. (Haydock)</font></p><b>
