                           the common one, or about twenty-one inches. Pliny ([Natural History?] vi. 26.) improperly applies this to Roman feet, and

                                    every side in the day of her affliction.</p>

                                    <p>8 *Babylon is suddenly fallen, and destroyed: howl for her, take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed.</p>
                                    <p>9 We would have cured Babylon, but she is not healed: let us forsake her, and let us go every man to his own land: because

                                    <p>17 Every man is become foolish by <i>his </i>knowledge; every founder is confounded by his idol, for what he hath cast

                                    the Lord of hosts is his name.</p>
                                    <p>20 Thou dashest together for me the weapons of war, and with thee I will dash nations together, and with thee I will destroy
                                    kingdoms:</p>
                                    <p>21 And with thee I will break in pieces the horse, and his rider: and with thee I will break in pieces the chariot, and
                                    him that getteth up into it.</p>
                                    <p>22 And with thee I will break in pieces man and woman, and with thee I will break in pieces the old man and the child,
                                    and with thee I will break in pieces the young man and the virgin:</p>
                                    <p>23 And with thee I will break in pieces the shepherd and his flock, and with thee I will break in pieces the husbandman
                                    and his yoke of oxen, and with thee I will break in pieces captains and rulers.</p>
                                    <p>24 And I will render to Babylon, and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea, all their evil that they have done in Sion, before
                                    your eyes, saith the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>25 Behold I <i>come against</i> thee, thou destroying mountain, saith the Lord, which corruptest the whole earth: and I
                                    will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.</p>
                                    <p>26 And they shall not take of thee a stone for the corner, nor a stone for foundations, but thou shalt be destroyed for
                                    ever, saith the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>27 Set ye up a standard in the land; sound with a trumpet among the nations; prepare the nations against her; call together
                                    against her the kings of Ararat, Menni, and Ascenez: number Taphsar against her; bring the horse as the stinging locust.</p>
                                    <p>28 Prepare the nations against her, the kings of Media, their captains, and all the rulers, and all the land of their dominion.</p>
                                    <p>29 And the land shall be in a commotion, and shall be troubled; for the design of the Lord against Babylon shall awake,
                                    to make the land of Babylon desert and uninhabitable.</p>
                                    <p>30 The valiant men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they have dwelt in holds: their strength hath failed, and they are
                                    become as women; her dwelling places are burnt, her bars are broken.</p>
                                    <p>31 One running post shall meet another, and messenger shall meet messenger, to tell the king of Babylon that his city is
                                    taken from one end to the other:</p>
                                    <p>32 And that the fords are taken, and the marshes are burnt with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.</p>
                                    <p>33 For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a thrashing-floor; this is the
                                    time of her thrashing: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.</p>
                                    <p>34 Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon, hath eaten me up, he hath devoured me; he hath made me as an empty vessel; he hath
                                    swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicate meats, and he hath cast me out.</p>
                                    <p>35 The wrong done to me, and my flesh, <i>be </i>upon Babylon, saith the habitation of Sion; and my blood upon the inhabitants
                                    of Chaldea, saith Jerusalem.</p>
                                    <p>36 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will judge thy cause, and will take vengeance for thee, and I will make her
                                    sea desolate, *and will dry up her spring.</p>
                                    <p>37 And Babylon shall be reduced to heaps, a dwelling-place for dragons, an astonishment and a hissing, because there is
                                    no inhabitant.</p>
                                    <p>38 They shall roar together like lions, they shall shake their manes like young lions.</p>
                                    <p>39 In their heat I will set them drink; and I will make them drunk, *that they may slumber, and sleep an everlasting sleep,
                                    and awake no more, saith the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>40 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, and like rams with kids.</p>
                                    <p>41 How is Sesach taken, and the renowned one of all the earth surprised? How is Babylon become an astonishment among the
                                    nations?</p>
                                    <p>42 The sea is come up over Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.</p>
                                    <p>43 Her cities are become an astonishment, a land uninhabited and desolate, a land wherein none can dwell, nor son of man
                                    pass through it.</p>
                                    <p>44 And I will visit against Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he had swallowed down: and
                                    the nations shall no more flow together to him, for the wall also of Babylon shall fall.</p>
                                    <p>45 Go out of the midst of her, my people; that every man may save his life from the fierce wrath of the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>46 And lest your hearts faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land: and a rumour shall come in one
                                    year, and after this year <i>another </i>rumour: and iniquity in the land, and ruler upon ruler.</p>
                                    <p>47 Therefore, behold the days come, and I will visit the idols of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and
                                    all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.</p>
                                    <p>48 And the heavens and the earth, and all things that are in them shall give praise for Babylon: for spoilers shall come
                                    to her from the north, saith the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>49 And as Babylon caused that there should fall slain in Israel; so of Babylon there shall fall slain in all the earth.</p>
                                    <p>50 You that have escaped the sword, come away, stand not still; remember the Lord afar off, and let Jerusalem come into
                                    your mind.</p>
                                    <p>51 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; shame hath covered our faces; because strangers are come upon the
                                    sanctuary of the house of the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>52 Therefore, behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will visit her graven things, and in all her land the wounded
                                    shall groan.</p>
                                    <p>53 If Babylon should mount up to heaven, and establish her strength on high; from me there should come spoilers upon her,
                                    saith the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>54 The noise of a cry from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:</p>
                                    <p>55 Because the Lord hath laid Babylon waste, and destroyed out of her the great voice; and their wave shall roar like many
                                    waters; their voice hath made a noise:</p>
                                    <p>56 Because the spoiler is come upon her, that is, upon Babylon, and her valiant men are taken, and their bow is weakened,
                                    because the Lord, who is a strong revenger, will surely repay.</p>
                                    <p>57 And I will make her princes drunk, and her wise men, and her captains, and her rulers, and her valiant men; and they
                                    shall sleep an everlasting sleep, and shall awake no more, saith the king, whose name is Lord of hosts.</p>
                                    <p>58 Thus saith the Lord of hosts: That broad wall of Babylon shall be utterly broken down, and her high gates shall be burnt
                                    with fire, and the labours of the people shall come to nothing, and of the nations shall go to the fire and shall perish.</p>
                                    <p>59 The word that Jeremias, the prophet, commanded Saraias, the son of Nerias, the son of Naasias, when he went with king
                                    Sedecias, to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign: now Saraias was chief over the prophecy.</p>
                                    <p>60 And Jeremias wrote in one book all the evil that was to come upon Babylon: all these words that are written against
                                    Babylon.</p>
                                    <p>61 And Jeremias said to Saraias: When thou shalt come into Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words,</p>
                                    <p>62 Thou shalt say, O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place to destroy it; so that there should be neither man nor beast
                                    to dwell therein, and that it should be desolate for ever.</p>
                                    <p>63 And when thou shalt have made an end of reading this book, thou shalt tie a stone to it, and shalt throw it into the
                                    midst of the Euphrates:</p>
                                    <p>64 And thou shalt say: Thus shall Babylon sink, and she shall not rise up from the affliction that I will bring upon her,
                                    and she shall be utterly destroyed. Thus far <i>are </i>the words of Jeremias.</p>
