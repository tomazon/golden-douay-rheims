                           After the miracles that Christ had performed, though he was not ignorant how much they despised him, yet that there might
                           be no excuse for their disbelief, he condescended to return to them. (Theophylactus)</font></p><b>

                           St. Matthew relates that they asked: <i>Is not this the son of the carpenter?</i> It is not improbable that both questions
                           were asked; it was certainly very natural to take him for a carpenter, who was the son of one. (St. Augustine) --- <i>They
                           were scandalized</i> at his lowly birth and humble parentage. Hence Jesus Christ takes occasion to expose the malice and envy
                           of the Jews, in refusing him, and to shew that the Gentiles would more esteem him. See Luke iv. 25[22?], and John i.</font></p>

                           It was usual for the Jews to prescribe oil as a proper thing to anoint the sick; but its virtue in the present instance, when
                           used by the apostles, was not natural but supernatural, and was derived from him who sent them; because this unction always
                           produced a certain and constant cure in those who were anointed. This miraculous gift of healing the sick with oil, which
                           Christ conferred on his apostles, was a prelude or gradual preparation to the dignity to which he raised this unction, when
                           he established it a perpetual rite in his holy Church. (Rutter) --- <i>With oil,</i> &amp;c. This anointing the sick, was
                           at least a figure of the sacrament, which Christ was pleased to institute for the spiritual relief of persons in danger of
                           death: and which is fully expressed by St. James, in his Catholic Epistle. (James&nbsp;vi.[v.?]) The Council of Trent says
                           this sacrament <i>was insinuated in St. Mark, and published in the Epistle of St. James.</i> (Council of Trent, session xiv.,
                           chap. 1.) (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           The Herod here mentioned was the son of Herod, from whom St. Joseph fled with Jesus and Mary into Egypt. (St. Chrysostom,
                           hom. xlix. in Matt.) --- How great was the envy of the Jews, is easily to be conceived from this passage. They can believe
                           that John is risen from the dead, and appeared in public again, although no one gave testimony that this was the case: but
                           that Jesus, so much favoured by God, who worked so many and so great miracles, should be risen again is incredible, although
                           attested by angels, by apostles, by men, women, and persons of every denomination. They still assert that the body of Jesus
                           was stolen. (Ven. Bede)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Herod,</i>[2] &amp;c. The sense both of the Latin and Greek text seems to be, that Herod entertained and shewed a particular
                           respect and value for John the Baptist: yet some expound it, that he had a watchful eye over him, and sought only for an occasion
                           to take him off. (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           It is customary, in Scripture, to give the generally prevailing sentiment at the time; thus Joseph is called by the blessed
                           Virgin, the father of Jesus; so now Herod is said to be stricken with sadness, because he appeared to be so to the company
                           at table, though within his own breast, he secretly rejoiced that he had an opportunity of destroying an importuning monitor,
                           with an exterior shew of piety and honour. (Ven. Bede)</font></p><b>

                           Church history informs us, that the Christians were accustomed to frequent this tomb with great piety and respect, till the
                           reign of Julian the apostate, at which time the pagans, through hatred for Christianity, broke open his tomb, and dispersed
                           his bones; but immediately after, thinking it better to burn them, they endeavoured to collect them again. But some religious
                           of a neighbouring convent, joining themselves to the pagans, under pretence of collecting the bones to burn, secreted the
                           greater part of them, and sent them to Philip, at Jerusalem, who sent them to Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria; and in the
                           reign of Theodosius, the temple of Serapis was converted into a Christian church, and dedicated to the honour of St. John
                           the Baptist, where his relics were deposited. (Gloss. Ordina.)</font></p><b>

                           <i>For two hundred pence.</i> See Matthew xviii. 28. The apostles seem to speak these words ironically, to signify that they
                           had not so much money as could procure a mouthful for each of them. (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           The apostles were in a desert place belonging to Bethsaida, which probably was divided from it by some bay or creek, that
                           ran into the land; and Christ only ordered them to pass over this to the city, where he might afterwards have joined them,
                           when he had sent away the people. But in their passage a great storm arose, and they were driven by an adverse wind to the
                           open sea, towards Capharnaum; or, probably, when they found the wind so violent, afraid of shipwreck if they neared the shore,
                           they rowed out to sea. This reconciles the seeming discrepance of St. Mark and St. John, when notwithstanding the directions
                           Christ had given his disciples to go before him to Bethsaida, we find them going to Capharnaum. (Rutter)</font></p><b>
