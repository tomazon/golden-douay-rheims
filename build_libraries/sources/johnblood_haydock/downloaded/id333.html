                           <p><strong>Notes &amp; Commentary:</strong></p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 1.</strong> <i>Daughters.</i> These had borne equal proportion with the males from the beginning; but here
                           they are particularized, because they were the chief instruments in corrupting the descendants of Seth. (Haydock) --- Even
                           the sons of these libidinous people were so effeminate, as to deserve to be called women. (Menochius)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 2.</strong> <i>The sons of God.</i> The descendants of Seth and Enos are here called <i>Sons of God,</i> from
                           their religion and piety: whereas the ungodly race of Cain, who by their carnal affections lay grovelling upon the earth,
                           are called the children of men. The unhappy consequence of the former marrying with the latter, ought to be a warning to Christians
                           to be very circumspect in their marriages; and not to suffer themselves to be determined in choice by their carnal passion,
                           to the prejudice of virtue or religion. (Challoner) --- See St. Chrysostom, hom. 22, &amp;c. Some copies of the Septuagint
                           having <i>the angels of God,</i> induced some of the ancients to suppose, that these spiritual beings (to whom, by another
                           mistake, they attributed a sort of aerial bodies) had commerce with women, as the pagans derived their heroes from a mortal
                           and a god. But this notion, which is borrowed from the book of Henoch, is quite exploded. (Calmet) --- The distinction of
                           the true Church from the synagogue of satan, here established, has been ever since retained, as heretics are still distinguished
                           from Catholics. (Worthington) (St. Augustine)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 3.</strong> <i>His days shall be,</i> &amp;c. The meaning is, that man's days, which before the flood were
                           usually 900 years, should now be reduced to 120 years. Or rather, that God would allow men this term of 120 years, for their
                           repentance and conversion, before he would send the deluge. (Challoner) --- He spoke therefore to Noe in his 480th year. (St.
                           Augustine) Those who suppose, that he foretold this event 20 years later, think with St. Jerome, that God retrenched 20 years
                           from the time first assigned for penance. The <i>Spirit</i> of the sovereign Judge was fired with <i>contending;</i> or, as
                           others translate it, with remaining quiet as in a <i>scabbard,</i> and bearing with the repeated crimes of men. He resolved
                           to punish them severely in this world, that he might shew mercy to some of them hereafter. (St. Jerome, 9. Heb.) (Calmet)
                           --- If we suppose, that God here threatens to reduce the space of man's life to 120 years, we must say, at least, that he
                           did it by degrees: for many lived several hundred years, even after the deluge. In the days of Moses, indeed, few exceeded
                           that term. But we think the other interpretation is more literal, and that God bore with mankind the full time which he promised.
                           (Worthington)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 4.</strong> <i>Giants.</i> It is likely the generality of men before the flood were of a gigantic stature,
                           in comparison with what men now are. But these here spoken of, are called <i>giants,</i> as being not only tall in stature,
                           but violent and savage in their dispositions, and mere monsters of cruelty and lust. (Challoner) --- Yet we need not imagine,
                           that they were such as the poets describe, tearing up mountains, and hurling them against heaven. Being offspring of men,
                           who had lived hitherto with great temperance, but now gave full scope to their passions, and the love of the fair daughters
                           whom <i>they chose,</i> we need not wonder that they should be amazingly strong and violent. <i>Nephilim, rushing on,</i>
                           as Ag.[Aquila?] translates. That there have been giants of an unusual size, all historians testify. Og, Goliah, &amp;c. are
                           mentioned in Scripture, and the sons of Enac are represented as much above the common size, as the Hebrews were greater than
                           grasshoppers, Numbers xiii. 34. If we should suppose they were four or five times our size, would that be more wonderful than
                           that they should live nine or ten times as long as we do? See St. Augustine, City of God xv. 9, 23; Calmet's Dissert. &amp;c.
                           Delrio affirms, that in 1572 he saw at Rouen, a native of Piedmont, above nine feet high. (Haydock) --- <i>Of old.</i> The
                           corruption of morals had commenced many ages ago, and some of the sons of Seth had given way to their lusts; so that we are
                           not to suppose, that these giants were all born within a hundred years of the flood, as some might suppose from their being
                           mentioned here, after specifying the age of Noe, chap. v. 31. (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 5.</strong> <i>At all times.</i> Hebrew: only evil continually. They had no relish for any thing else: as
                           we may say of a glutton, he thinks of nothing but his belly. Yet some good thoughts would occur occasionally, and we may grant
                           that they did some things which were not sinful. (Menochius) --- If we follow corrupt nature, and live among sinners, we find
                           a law within us warring against the spirit; and a very powerful grace is necessary to rescue us from such a dangerous situation.
                           (Calmet) --- Though the expressions in this place seem general, they must be understood with some limitations. (Worthington)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 6.</strong> <i>It repented him,</i> &amp;c. God, who is unchangeable, is not capable of repentance, grief,
                           or any other passion. But these expressions are used to declare the enormity of the sins of men, which was so provoking as
                           to determine their Creator to destroy these his creatures, whom before he had so much favoured. (Challoner) --- God acted
                           outwardly as a man would do who repented. (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 8.</strong> <i>Grace.</i> Notwithstanding the general denunciation against all flesh, we see here that God
                           will not confound the just with the guilty, in the same punishment. Noe pleased God, by observing the most perfect justice,
                           in the midst of a corrupt generation. (St. Chrysostom; &amp;c.) (Worthington)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 12.</strong> <i>Its way,</i> being abandoned to the most shameful and unnatural sins. (Liranus)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 13.</strong> <i>All flesh.</i> I will destroy all these carnal and wicked people, and, because all other creatures
                           were made only for man's use, and will be useless, I will involve them in the common ruin, reserving only what will be necessary
                           for the support of the few, who shall be preserved, and for the repeopling of the earth. (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 14.</strong> <i>Timber planks.</i> Hebrew, "gopher wood," which is no where else mentioned in Scripture. It
                           was probably a sort of wood full of rosin, and being besmeared with something like our pitch, was capable of resisting the
                           fury of the ensuing tremendous storm, for a length of time. (Calmet; Haydock) --- <i>Rooms</i> to separate the birds, various
                           animals, provisions, &amp;c. --- <i>Pitch,</i> literally: "besmear it with bitumen," which has a very strong smell, able to
                           counteract the disagreeable odours arising from beasts confined. (Menochius) --- It might be mixed with some other ingredients,
                           naphtha, pitch, &amp;c. (Calmet)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 15.</strong> <i>Three hundred cubits,</i> &amp;c. The ark, according to the dimensions here set down, contained
                           four hundred and fifty thousand square cubits; which were more than enough to contain all the kinds of living creatures, with
                           all necessary provisions: even supposing the cubits here spoken of to have been only a foot and a half each, which was the
                           least kind of cubits. (Challoner) --- It is therefore unnecessary for us to have recourse, with Cappel, to the sacred cubit,
                           which was twice as large as the common one, but which seems not to have been in use among the Jews before the Babylonian captivity.
                           Still less need we adopt the geometrical cubit, which contains six ordinary ones, as we might be authorised to do by the great
                           names of Origen and St. Augustine, City of God xv. 27. q. in Gen. i. 4. These dimensions would make the ark as large as a
                           city. Moses always speaks of the same sort of cubit, used probably in Egypt. Apelles and other heretics, with some modern
                           infidels, have attempted to shew, that this account of Moses is fabulous. But they have been amply refuted by able calculators,
                           John Buteo, Pelletier, &amp;c. This amazing structure, for which God himself gave the plan, was divided with three stories,
                           besides the lower part of the vessel, which might serve to keep fresh water. The different species of animals are not so numerous,
                           as some imagine. Fishes, and such creatures as can live in water, would not need to come into the ark. Animals deprived of
                           exercise, and allowed barely what may support nature, will live upon a very little. Even an ox, according to Columella, will
                           live on 30 pounds of hay, or on a cubic foot, a whole day, so that 400 of these large creatures might be supported on 146,000
                           cubic feet. The middle story, for provisions, would alone contain 150,000 cubits. Noe's family, and the birds, would probably
                           occupy the room above, in which was a window all around, of the height of a <i>cubit,</i> without glass or crystal, which
                           were not yet invented, but defended with lattice work of wood, like our dairy rooms. (Haydock)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 16.</strong> <i>In a cubit.</i> This is understood by some, of the height of the window; by others, of the
                           roof, which would be almost flat, like the top of a coach. Menoch supposes, that the whole ark was to be measured with the
                           cubit in every part, from the bottom <i>to the top;</i> and the words <i>of it,</i> properly refer to the ark. --- <i>Side,</i>
                           or at the end, about the middle way, that the animals might be conveyed easily to their stalls. The door would open into the
                           story allotted to the beasts, and all things might enter it by a sort of bridge, or by sloping planks. (Calmet) --- Ordure
                           might be thrown down into the lowest part of the ark, separated from the reservoir of fresh water, or might be brought up
                           with ropes and buckets to the window at the top, which would easily open. (Tirinus)</p>
                           <p><strong>Ver. 18.</strong> <i>My covenant,</i> that thou shalt be saved, amid the general ruin. This is the second covenant
                           of God with man: the first was with Adam, the third with Abraham, when circumcision was instituted, and the last with Moses,
                           Exodus xix. All others were only ratifications of these; and even these were only figures of that which our Saviour entered
                           into with men, when he undertook to make satisfaction for them to his Father. (Calmet)</p>
