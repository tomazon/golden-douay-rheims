                           <I>Jesus answered, and spoke to them again in parables,</I> and concludes his discourse with again describing, 1st. the reprobation
                           of the Jews; 2d. the calling of the Gentiles to the true faith; and 3d. the final judgment of both the one and the other.
                           In this parable of the marriage feast, says St. Chrysostom, our Saviour again declares to the Jews their reprobation, and
                           the vocation of the Gentiles, their great ingratitude, and his tender solicitude for them. For he did not send them a single
                           invitation only; he repeatedly invited them. <I>Say,</I> says he, <I>to the invited;</I> and afterwards, <I>call the invited;</I>
                           thus evincing the greatness of their obstinacy, in resisting all the calls and pressing invitations of the Almighty. (Hom.
                           lxx.) --- This parable is certainly not the same as that mentioned in St. Luke xiv. 16, as every one that will be at the pains
                           to examine and compare all the circumstances of each, will easily discover, though they are very much alike. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           like to a man being a king,</I> &amp;c. This parable seems different from that of Luke xiv. 16. See St. Augustine, lib. ii.
                           de Cons. Evang. chap. lxx. The main design in this parable, is to shew the Jews that they were all invited to believe in Christ;
                           though so few of them believed. The <I>king</I> is God; <I>his son</I> is Jesus Christ; the <I>spouse</I> is the Church; the
                           <I>marriage</I> is Christ's incarnation; the <I>feast,</I> the grace of God in this life, and his glory in the next. <I>His
                           servants</I> were the prophets; and lastly his precursor, St. John the Baptist. --- <I>My fatlings,</I> which I have prepared,
                           and made fat for the feast: but this is but an ornament of the parable. (Witham) --- The same takes place in the kingdom of
                           heaven, as when a king makes a marriage feast for his son. Jesus Christ seems to have had two things in view in this parable:
                           1st. that many are called to the kingdom of heaven, i.e. his Church, and that few come, as he concludes, ver. 14, <I>many
                           are called, </I>&amp;c; 2d. that not all that come when called will be saved, i.e. will be reputed worthy of the celestial
                           feast; because some have not on the wedding-garment, as he shews, ver. 11. (Menochius) --- Thus the conduct of God in the
                           formation of his Church, and in the vocation of men to glory which himself has prepared for them in the kingdom of heaven,
                           is like to that of a king, wishing to celebrate the marriage of his son. (Bible de Vence) --- Marriage is here mentioned,
                           says St. Chrysostom to shew there is nothing sorrowful in the kingdom of God, but all full of the greatest spiritual joy.
                           St. John the Baptist likewise calls our Saviour the <I>spouse;</I> and St. Paul says, <I>I have espoused thee to one man,</I>
                           2 Corinthians xi. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxx.) See also Ephesians v. 25. and Apocalypse xxi. 2. and 9. <I>The nuptials</I>
                           in this place do not signify the union of marriage, or the incarnation of Jesus Christ, by which the Church is made his spouse;
                           but the marriage feast, to which men are said to be invited. This is no other than the doctrines, the sacraments and graces,
                           with which God feeds and nourishes our souls, united to him by faith in this life, and by eternal joy and glory in the next.
                           (Jansenius) --- This union is begun here on earth by faith, is cemented by charity in all such as are united to Christ in
                           the profession of the one true faith he came down to establish, and will be consummated and made perpetual hereafter by the
                           eternal enjoyment of Christ in his heavenly kingdom.</FONT></P><B>

                           to the nuptials that were to be celebrated in his time. The Jews were invited by Moses and the prophets, and were instructed
                           to believe that the Messias would celebrate this happy feast. On the predetermined day, they were again called by his servants,
                           saying: <I>Do penance; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand:</I> come to the feast, i.e. become members of his Church, by
                           believing in Christ. (Jansenius) --- In the same manner, St. Chrysostom says that the Jews had been invited by the voice of
                           the prophets, and afterwards by the Baptist, who declared to all, that Christ should increase, but that he himself should
                           decrease. At length, they were invited by the Son in person, crying aloud to them: <I>come to me all you that labour, and
                           are heavily laden, and I will refresh you.</I> (Matthew xi. 28.) And again: <I>if any man thirst, let him come to me and drink.</I>
                           (St. John vii. 37.) --- and not by his words only, but by his actions also did he call them; and after his resurrection, by
                           the ministry of Peter and the rest of the apostles (hom. lxx,) he informed the invited Jews that the banquet was ready; because
                           the Christian religion being now established, the way to eternal happiness was laid open to mankind.</FONT></P><B>

                           enjoyments, their oxen, lands and wives. From the punishment inflicted on these, we learn, that no consideration, how specious
                           soever it may appear, can prove a legitimate excuse for neglecting our spiritual duties. (St. John Chrysostom, hom. lxx.)

                           feast, to be <I>charity.</I> This is the sentiment of the ancients, of St. Gregory, St. Ambrose, and others. What St. Chrysostom
                           expounds it, viz. an immaculate life, or a life shining with virtues, and free from the filth of sin, is nearly the same;
                           for charity cannot exist without a good life, nor the purity of a good life, without charity. In his 70th homily on St. Matthew,
                           he says that the garment of life is our works; and this is here mentioned, that none might presume, (like Calvin and his followers)
                           that faith alone was sufficient for salvation. When, therefore we are called by the grace of God, we are clothed with a white
                           garment, to preserve which from every stain, from every grievous sin, depends upon the diligence (the watching and praying)
                           of every individual. (St. John Chrysostom) --- It was the custom then, as it still is in every civilized nation, not to appear
                           at a marriage feast, or at a dinner of ceremony, except in the very best attire. (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>

                           Jews, whether they, being the peculiar people of God, ought to be subject and pay taxes to Cæsar, or to any prince whatsoever,
                           or be exempt from them. (Witham) --- Judas Galilæus, about the time of Christ's birth, stirred up the people to a revolt,
                           which though suppressed by violent measures, and himself slain by the Romans, yet the doctrine he broached did not expire
                           with him. Some even among the Pharisees were of opinion, that it was unlawful for the people of God to serve strangers and
                           idolaters, as we learn from Josephus. The question, therefore, proposed to our Saviour was insidious in the extreme, and not
                           easy to be answered, without incurring the displeasure of one or&nbsp;other of the parties. For, if he answered that it was
                           lawful, he would expose himself to the hatred of the Jews, who were aggrieved with what generally thought an unjust extortion,
                           and a mark of servitude injurious to God; if he denied the legality of this hated capitation-tax, he would incur the displeasure
                           of the Herodians, and be denounced to Cæsar. This latter appears to have been their wish; as, in that case, it would have
                           been very easy to persuade Pilate, that Christ and his disciples coming from Galilee, were favourers of that sect, who, from
                           the name of their founder, Judas Galilæus, were called Galilæans; and some of whom, as we read in St. Luke (chap. xiii. 1,)
                           Pilate put to death, <I>whose blood he mingled with their sacrifices.</I> Indeed so determined were the enemies of Christ
                           to injure him with Pilate on this subject, that notwithstanding his answer was plainly in favour of the tribute, yet they
                           blushed not a few days after to accuse him to Pilate of teaching it to be unlawful to pay tribute; <I>we have found him, say
                           they, forbidding tribute to be paid to Cæsar.</I> (Tirinus and Denis the Carthusian)</FONT></P><B>

                           was, to let them see that the secrets of their inmost heart were open to him, and thus induce them to be converted from their

                           to be this: As you are the subjects of Cæsar, which you plainly acknowledge by admitting his coin, upon which he inscribes
                           himself lord of Asia, Syria, and Judæa, &amp;c. it is but just you pay him the tribute due from subjects to their sovereign;
                           nor have you any reason to object on the plea of religion, since he demands of you for the exigencies of the public service
                           only temporal things, and such as are in some respects already his own, by being stamped with his own image and superscription.
                           But spiritual things, which belong to God alone, as your souls, stamped with his image, divine worship, religious homage,
                           &amp;c. God, not Cæsar, demands of you. "Give therefore to Cæsar what belongeth to Cæsar, and to God what belongeth to God."
                           (Tirinus) --- What our Saviour here commands us to give to God, is nothing else but our heart and affections. Here our divine
                           Lord likewise shews us, how we are to steer the middle course between the two extremes, into which some persons fall. Some
                           say that all must be given to God, and nothing to Cæsar, i.e. all our time must be given to the care of our soul, and none
                           to the care of the body; but Christ teaches that some must be given to the one, and part to the other. (Origen) --- Although
                           Christ clearly establishes here the strict obligation of paying to Cæsar what belongs to Cæsar, yet he is afterwards accused,
                           as we have mentioned above, (see note on ver. 17) as if he forbade tribute to be paid to Cæsar. In like manner, in spite of
                           the most explicit declarations of the Catholic Church, respecting her loyalty and subjection to temporal powers, her enemies
                           fail not to calumniate her doctrine as inimical to the state, and subversive of due subordination. But let our opponents attend
                           to the following authority and public declaration of Pope Clement XIV. addressed to all Catholic bishops in the Christian
                           world. "Be careful," says he, "that those whose instruction in the law of the gospel is committed to your charge, be made
                           sensible from their very infancy of their sacred obligation of loyalty to their kings, of respect to their authority, and
                           of submission to their laws, not only for wrath, but for conscience sake." --- But princes should not exact, and subjects
                           should not affect to give them ecclesiastical jurisdiction. St. Athanasius quotes the following strong words from an epistle
                           of the famous confessor Hosius, to Constantius, the Arian emperor: "Cease, I beseech thee, and remember that thou art mortal.
                           Fear the day of judgment, and meddle not with ecclesiastical matters; neither do thou command us in this kind, but rather
                           learn them of us. To thee God hath committed the empire; to us he hath committed what belongs to the Church. And as he who,
                           with a malicious eye, hath designs upon thine empire, opposeth the ordinance of God; so do thou also beware lest, by an improper
                           interference in ecclesiastical matters, thou be made guilty of a great crime. For it is written, <I>Give to Cæsar,</I> &amp;c.
                           Therefore, neither is it lawful for us on earth to hold the empire, neither hast thou, O emperor, power over incense and sacred
                           things." (St. Athansius, ep. ad solit. vitam agentes.) --- And St. Ambrose to Valentinian, the emperor, (who by the ill counsel
                           of his mother Justina, an Arian, required of St. Ambrose to have one church in Milan made over to the Arian heretics) saith:
                           "We pay that which is Cæsar's to Cæsar, and that which is God's to God. Tribute is Cæsar's; it is not denied. The Church is
                           God's; it cannot verily be yielded to Cæsar; because the temple of God cannot be Cæsar's right. Be it said, as all must allow
                           to the honour of the emperor, for what is more honourable than that the emperor be said to be the son of the Church? A good
                           emperor is within the Church, but not above the Church." (St. Ambrose, lib. v. epist. Orat. de Basil, trad.)</FONT></P><B>

                           in effect these two tenets are inseparable. The soul being immortal, ought necessarily to be one day reunited to the body,
                           to receive therein the recompense or punishment which it has merited in this same body, when it was clothed with it. --- By
                           this text St. Jerome refutes the heretic Vigilantius, and in him many of modern date, who to diminish the honour Catholics
                           pay to the saints, call them designedly<I> dead men.</I> But the Almighty <I>is not the God of the dead;</I> of consequence
                           these patriarchs, dead as they are in our eyes as to their bodies, are still alive in the eyes of God as to their souls, which
                           he has created immortal, and which he will undoubtedly have the power of reuniting to their bodies. --- The Sadducees were
                           a profane sect, who denied the resurrection of the body, and the existence of angels and spirits, and any future state in
                           another world: (see Acts xxiii. 8.) nor did they receive any books but the five books of Moses. Christ therefore, from a passage
                           Exodus iii. 15, shewed them that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, had still a being; because God, 200 years after the death of the
                           last, said thus to Moses, <I>I am the God of Abraham,</I> &amp;c. He did not say, (as St. Chrysostom takes notice) <I>I was
                           the God of Abraham,</I> &amp;c. Therefore these souls had a being: for the Lord would not call himself the God of those who
                           were not at all: no one calling himself lord or king of those who are no more. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>
