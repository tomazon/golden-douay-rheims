                           countenance. St. Stephen's design in this discourse, was to shew them, first, that he was falsely accused of speaking either
                           against Moses, or the law, for which he shews so great a veneration. 2. He puts them in mind, that the true worship of God
                           may subsist without a temple, as it did in the time of Abraham, and the patriarchs, before the law was given, or the temple
                           built. 3. That as their forefathers had been rebellious to Moses, and disobedient to the prophets, whom they many times persecuted
                           even to death, so they had lately resisted, persecuted, and crucified their Messias. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           their mosques. The Jewish priests served in the temple with their shoes off. The angel who appeared to Josue ordered him also
                           to take off his shoes. (Josue v. 16.) If the apparition of an angel, or of God himself, could make the place and ground holy
                           so as to deserve external signs of respect, and veneration from Moses; how much more the corporal birth, abode, and miracles

                           place, than by calling him a <I>Mediator,</I> in Galatians iii. 19. He is called a Redeemer, says this learned Protestant
                           commentator, in as much as he led forth, and preserved the people of God safe by the blood of a lamb, and thus exhibited a
                           figure of the true redemption, through the blood of Christ." We all own that Jesus Christ, as having paid the ransom of our
                           delivery with his own blood, is, strictly speaking, our only true Redeemer, and Advocate with his Father, who asks and obtains
                           all things immediately by his own merit; but this does not exclude the prayers of the saints, both alive and dead. Did not
                           the apostles pray for the people, and desire the people to pray for them? "Our Lord Jesus Christ still intercedes for us,
                           and all the martyrs that are with him, pray for us: nor will their intercession cease, till we cease our groanings," says
                           St. Augustine, in Ps. lxxxv. in fine.</FONT></P><B>

                           he gives the most sensible marks of his presence, are of assistance to us, when we render our homage, address our vows, and
                           offer our prayers to the Deity. St. Stephen's design in this part of his discourse, is to prove that the true religion may
                           subsist without the temple; therefore, that he could not be guilty of blasphemy, supposing he had even used the words which

                           See with what arms St. Stephen defended himself against the fury of his enemies. He puts on charity for a breast-plate, and
                           by that came off victorious. By his love of God, he resisted the enraged Jews; by the love he bore his neighbour, he prayed
                           for those that stoned him. Through charity, he admonished them of their errors, in order to their amendment; through charity,
                           he besought the divine goodness not to punish their crimes against him. Leaning on charity, he overcame the cruelty of Saul,
                           and merited to have him a companion in heaven, who had been his chief persecutor on earth. (St. Fulgentius, Serm. de S. Steph.)
                           --- We here again see the powerful intercession of the saints; "for," says St. Augustine, "if Stephen had not thus prayed,
                           the Church would not have to glory in a St. Paul. Si Stephanus non sic orasset, Ecclesia Paulum non haberet." (Serm. i. de
