                           sinner can despair when he sees the Saviour of mankind seeking to save him; when he beholds even a publican and a rich man,
                           at the same time, who, as our Saviour informs us in another place, are so seldom truly converted, brought to the light of
                           faith, and the grace of a true conversion! (St. Ambrose) --- Zacheus (who as a farmer of the customs, not a collector, as
                           some falsely imagine) immediately hearkened to the interior voice of the Almighty, calling him to repentance; he made no delay,
                           and therefore deserved immediately not only to see, but to eat, drink, and converse with Jesus. (St. Cyril) --- Behold here
                           the three steps of his conversion: 1. an ardent desire of seeing Jesus; 2. the honourable reception he gave him in his house;
                           3. the complete restitution of all ill-acquired property.</FONT></P><B>

                           whole nation of the Jews. They could not lay aside the ideas they had formed of the personal and temporal reign of the Messias.
                           Every thing which they could not reconcile with this standard, was completely impenetrable to them. It was a language they

                           parable is an exact prophetic history of what happened to Archelaus Antipas, son of Herod the great, about thirty-six years
                           afterwards. Judea being then tributary, he was obliged to go to Rome to receive his kingdom from the hands of the emperor
                           Augustus. The Jews, who hated him for his cruelty, sent an embassy to the emperor, to accuse him of many crimes, and disappoint
                           him in his hopes of gaining his crown. But Augustus confirmed it to him, and sent him back to reign in Judea, where he revenged
                           himself on those who had opposed his pretensions. With regard to the instruction, which is meant to be conveyed by this parable;
                           this nobleman is the Son of God, who came among the Jews to take possession of the kingdom, which was his due. But being rejected
                           and treated unworthily, and even put to a disgraceful death on the cross, he will one day come again, armed with vengeance,
                           and inflict the effects of his anger upon them. This was partly fulfilled at the destruction of Jerusalem, and will be completed
                           at the general judgment. (Calmet) (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>

                           At the crucifixion of our Redeemer, when his friends were silent through fear, the very stones and rocks spoke in his defence.
                           Immediately after he expired, the earth was moved, the rocks split, and the monuments of the dead opened. (Ven. Bede) ---

                           wept.</I> St. Epiphanius tells us, that some of the orthodox of his time, offended at these words, omitted them in their copies,
                           as if to shed tears, were a weakness unworthy of Christ: but this true reading of the evangelist is found in all copies, and
                           received by all the faithful; and the liberty which those who changed them took, was too dangerous ever to be approved of
                           by the Church. Neither do these tears argue in Jesus Christ any thing unworthy of his supreme majesty or wisdom. Our Saviour
                           possessed all the human passions, but not the defects of them. The Stoics, who condemned the passions in their sages, laboured
                           to make statues or automata of man, not philosophers. The true philosopher moderates and <I>governs</I> his passions; the
                           Stoic labours to <I>destroy</I> them, but cannot effect his purpose. And when he labours to overcome one passion, he is forced
                           to have recourse to another for help. (Calmet) --- Our Saviour is said to have wept six times, during his life on earth: 1st,
                           At his birth, according to many holy doctors; 2ndly, at his circumcision, according to St. Bernard and others; 3rdly, when
                           he raised Lazarus to life, as is related in St. John, chap. xi.; 4thly, in his entry into Jerusalem, described in this place;
                           5thly, during his agony in the garden, just before his apprehension, when, as St. Luke remarks, (Chap. xxii.) <I>his sweat
                           was as drops of blood trickling down upon the ground;</I> and 6thly, during his passion, when he often wept, on account of
                           his great distress of mind, occasioned principally by the knowledge he had of the grievousness of men's sins, and the bad
                           use they would make of the redemption he was, through so many sufferings, procuring for them. (Dionysius)</FONT></P><B>

                           that is, didst thou but know how severe a punishment is about to be inflicted upon thee, for the numberless transgressions
                           of thy people, thou likewise wouldst weep; but, alas! hardened in iniquity, thou still rejoicest, ignorant of the punishment
                           hanging over thy head. Just men have daily occasion to bewail, like our blessed Redeemer, the blindness of the wicked, unable
                           to see, through their own perversity, the miserable state of their souls, and the imminent danger they are every moment exposed
                           to, of losing themselves for ever. Of these, Solomon cries out; (Proverbs ii. 13.) <I>They leave the right way, and walk through
                           dark ways.</I> We ought to imitate this compassion of our blessed Redeemer; and, as he wept over the calamities of the unfortunate
                           Jerusalem, though determined on his destruction; so we ought to bewail the sins not only of our friends, but likewise of our
                           enemies, and daily offer up our prayers for their conversion. (Dionysius)</FONT></P><B>
