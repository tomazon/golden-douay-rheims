                           Hebrew reads here 26,000; and some pretend (Calmet) that 1000 fell in the two victories which they obtained. (Grotius, &amp;c.)
                           --- But this is without proof, and the Vulgate is confirmed by Josephus, and by most of the copies of the Septuagint, though

                           Grabe repeats in the following verse with the Hebrew, "Among all this people, 700 chosen men," which seems to insinuate that
                           these expert archers were selected out of all the army. (Haydock) --- But the other copies of the Septuagint agree with the

                           a meaning is improbable, chap. iii. 15. --- <I>Side.</I> The inhabitants of Palestine formerly applied themselves very much
                           to this exercise, and by them it was propagated over other parts of the world. (Pliny, [Natural History?] vii. 56.) Strabo
                           (iii.) observes that the people of the Balearic islands became famous for slinging, only after the Ph&#339;nicians had taken
                           possession of their country, which is the present Majorca and Minorca. They could hit the mark without failing, and penetrate
                           every sort of armour. (Florus iii.) Their bullets of lead were sent with such violence, as sometimes to melt in the air, according
                           to Ovid and Seneca, q. 2. 56. The slingers commonly stood 600 paces from the mark of white, which they seldom missed. (Veget.
                           ii. 23.) The stones which they used weighted a pound among the Romans. The sling would frequently carry farther than a bow.
                           (Xenophon, Anab. v.) Yet the exploits of bowmen are not less extraordinary than what is here recorded. Philostorgius (ii.
                           12,) assures us that the Indians, after they have been drinking, will shoot at a child, and only touch the ends of his hair.
                           Domitian would shoot from a great distance, and make the arrow pass between the extended fingers of a child, and at other
                           times would divest himself with piercing an animal with two arrows, so that they would stick out like horns. (Suetonius) Soranus
                           could send an arrow into the air, and pierce it with another as it fell. The emperor Hadrian writes of him,</FONT></P>

                           they were thoroughly humbled, and had learned to trust in him alone. (Challoner) --- God's thoughts are often very different

                                    the Lord answered them: Let Juda be your leader.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And forthwith the children of Israel rising in the morning, camped

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And going out from thence to fight against Benjamin, began to assault

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 Again Israel, trusting in their strength and their number, set their

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Yet so that they first went up and wept before the Lord until night:
                                    and consulted him, and said: Shall I go out any more to fight against the children of Benjamin my brethren or not? And he
                                    answered them: Go up against them, and join battle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And when the children of Israel went out the next day to fight against
                                    the children of Benjamin,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 The children of Benjamin sallied forth out of the gates of Gabaa:
                                    and meeting them, made so great a slaughter of them, as to kill eighteen thousand men that drew the sword.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 Wherefore all the children of Israel came to the house of God, and
                                    sat and wept before the Lord: and they fasted that day till the evening, and offered to him holocausts, and victims of peace-offerings,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And inquired of him concerning their state. At that time the ark of
                                    the covenant of the Lord was there,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And Phinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was over the house.
                                    So they consulted the Lord, and said: Shall we go out any more to fight against the children of Benjamin, our brethren, or
                                    shall we cease? And the Lord said to them: Go up, for to-morrow I will deliver them into your hands.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And the children of Israel set ambushes round about the city of Gabaa:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And they drew up their army against Benjamin the third time, as they

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 And the children of Benjamin boldly issued out of the city, and seeing
                                    their enemies flee, pursued them a long way, so as to wound and kill some of them, as they had done the first and second day,
                                    whilst they fled by two highways, whereof one goeth up to Bethel, and the other to Gabaa, and they slew about thirty men:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 For they thought to cut them off as they did before. But they artfully
                                    feigning a flight, designed to draw them away from the city, and by their seeming to flee, to bring them to the highways aforesaid.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 Then all the children of Israel rising up out of the places where
                                    they were, set their army in battle array, in the place which is called Baalthamar. The ambushes also, which were about the
                                    city, began by little and little to come forth,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And to march from the west side of the city. And other ten thousand
                                    men chosen out of all Israel, attacked the inhabitants of the city. And the battle grew hot against the children of Benjamin:
                                    and they understood not that present death threatened them on every side.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And the Lord defeated them before the children of Israel, and they
                                    slew of them in that day five and twenty thousand, and one hundred, all fighting men, and that drew the sword.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 But the children of Benjamin, when they saw themselves to be too weak,
                                    began to flee. Which the children of Israel seeing, gave them place to flee, that they might come to the ambushes that were
                                    prepared, which they had set near the city.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 And they that were in ambush arose on a sudden out of their coverts,
                                    and whilst Benjamin turned their backs to the slayers, went into the city, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 Now the children of Israel had given a sign to them, whom they had
                                    laid in ambushes, that after they had taken the city, they should make a fire: that by the smoke rising on high, they might
                                    shew that the city was taken.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 And when the children of Israel saw this in the battle, (for the children
                                    of Benjamin thought they fled, and pursued them vigorously, killing thirty men of their army)</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 And perceived, as it were, a pillar of smoke rise up from the city;
                                    and Benjamin looking back, saw that the city was taken, and that the flames ascended on high:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 They that before had made as if they fled, turning their faces, stood
                                    bravely against them. Which the children of Benjamin seeing, turned their backs,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 And began to go towards the way of the desert, the enemy pursuing
                                    them thither also. And they that fired the city came also out to meet them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 And so it was, that they were slain on both sides by the enemies,
                                    and there was no rest of their men dying. They fell and were beaten down on the east side of the city of Gabaa.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 And they that were slain in the same place, were eighteen thousand
                                    men, all most valiant soldiers.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">45 And when they that remained of Benjamin saw this, they fled into the
                                    wilderness, and made towards the rock that is called Remmon. In that flight also, as they were straggling and going different
                                    ways, they slew of them five thousand men. And as they went farther, they still pursued them, and slew also other two thousand.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">46 And so it came to pass, that all that were slain of Benjamin, in divers
                                    places, were five and twenty thousand fighting men, most valiant for war.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">47 And there remained of all the number of Benjamin <i>only </i>six hundred
                                    men that were able to escape, and flee to the wilderness: and they abode in the rock Remmon four months.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">48 But the children of Israel returning, put all the remains of the city
                                    to the sword, both men and beasts, and all the cities and villages of Benjamin were consumed with devouring flames.</font></p>
