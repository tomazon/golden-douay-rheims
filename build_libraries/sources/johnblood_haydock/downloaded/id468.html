                           This was either the name of the king, or of his city, which was situated in the southern parts of Chanaan, and which fell
                           to the share of Hobab, in the tribe of Juda. (Haydock) --- When this king <I>heard,</I> by means of his <I>spies,</I> or was
                           informed that <I>Israel</I> intended to make an irruption into his country like <I>spies,</I> without declaring war, or <I>by
                           the way</I> which their <I>spies</I> had marked out either just before, or in the second year after their exit; or in fine,
                           by the road, which the Septuagint leave untranslated, <I>Athrim,</I> and which means "of the spies," he resolved to be beforehand
                           with them; and, coming suddenly upon them, took some spoils, or, according to the Hebrew, Septuagint, &amp;c., "captives."
                           These, by the ancient laws of war, he might either sell or put to death. <I>Vendere cum possis captivum, ocidere noli.</I>
                           (Horace) (Grotius, Jur. iii. 7.) The Rabbins pretend that this king took fresh courage on account of the death of Aaron, and
                           the consequent disappearance of the cloud, and that he drove the Israelites seven encampments back, as far as Mosera, which
                           they confound with Haseroth.</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>Horma,</I> or "Anathema," which was anciently called Saphaad, Judges i. 17. They fully executed their threat under Josue,
                           who defeated the king of Hered, (Josue xii. 14,) though they destroyed, at present, whatever they could. Arad was afterwards

                           They had before often directed their complaints against the two brothers. Now, Aaron being no more, they attack God himself,
                           who had always resented the injury done to his ministers. --- <I>Food.</I> So they call the heavenly manna: thus worldlings
                           loathe the things of heaven, for which they have no relish. (Challoner) --- Septuagint, "our soul is indignant at this most
                           empty bread," which has no solidity in it, nor support. Many translate the Hebrew, "most vile bread." Thus, in the blessed
                           eucharist, the substance of bread is removed, and the accidents only appear; so that to the worldly receiver, it seems very<EM>

                           serpents.</I> They are so called, because they that were bitten by them were burnt with a violent heat. (Challoner) --- Hence
                           they are called <I>seraphim,</I> by which name an order of angels is known. The Egyptians adored a serpent which they called
                           serapis, at Rome; and they represented their god serapis, with a serpent entwining a monstrous figure, composed of a lion,
                           a dog, and a wolf. (Macrob. Saturn i. 20.) The seraph was a winged serpent, Isaias xiv. 29. xxx. 6. Such often infested Egypt,
                           in spring, coming from Arabia, unless they were intercepted by the ibis. Their wings resembled those of bats. (Herodotus,
                           ii. 76.; Mela, &amp;c.) God probably sent some of this description into the camp of the Israelites. (Calmet) --- Some call
                           them pr&#339;ster, (Pliny, [Natural History?] xxiv. 13,) from their burning; others the hydra, or, when out of water, the
                           chershydra, the venom of which is most dangerous. The Septuagint style them simply, "the destroying, <I>or</I> deadly serpents."
                           See Bochart, T. ii. B. iii. 13.; Deuteronomy viii. 15.; Wisdom xvi. 5, 10.) (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           </I>Hebrew, "fiery." But in the following verse, it is said to have been "of brass." We might translate, "make a seraph, and
                           fix it upon a standard," (Calmet) in which form it would resemble one suspended on a cross. It was placed at the entrance
                           of the tabernacle. (St. Justin Martyr, First Apology) Ezechias afterwards destroyed it, because it was treated with superstitious
                           honours, 4 Kings xviii. 4. Thus the best things are often abused. (Haydock) --- God commands this image to be erected, while
                           he forbids all images of idols. (Worthington) --- By comparing the different passages of Scripture, we may discern the true
                           import of them. Pictures may often prove very useful and instructive. They serve the ignorant instead of books. But then the
                           ignorant must be carefully instructed not to treat them with improper respect, as St. Gregory admonishes. And is not the same
                           caution requisite for those who read even the word of God, lest they <I>wrest it to their own destruction,</I> as both the
                           <I>unlearned and the unstable </I>frequently do, 2 Peter iii. 16. If every thing must be rejected which is liable to abuse,
                           what part of the creation will be spared? The Bible, the sacraments, all creatures must be laid aside. For we read, (Romans
                           viii. 20, 22,) <I>the creature was made subject to vanity --- every creature groaneth.</I> (Haydock) --- It is probable that
                           Moses represented on the standard, such a serpent, as had been the instrument of death. This was not intended for a charm
                           or talisman, as Marsham would impiously pretend. (Chron. x. p. 148.) Such inventions proceed from the devil; and the Marsi
                           were famous for curing the bites of serpents, by giving certain plates of brass. (Arnob. ii.) See Psalm lviii. 5. But this
                           image was set up by God's express command; and the Book of Wisdom (xvi. 5, 7) assures us, that the effect was entirely to
                           be attributed to him, the figure of a brazen serpent being rather calculated to increase than to remove the danger. (Kimchi;
                           Muis) Hence Jonathan well observes, that only those were healed who raised their hearts to God. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           of the hellish serpent, John iii. 14. (Challoner) (St. Ambrose; Apol. i. 3.) As the old serpent infected the whole human race,
                           Jesus Christ gives life to those that look at him with entire confidence. (Theodoret, q. 38.) The brazen serpent was destitute
                           of poison, though it resembled a most noxious animal; so Jesus Christ assumed our nature, yet without sin. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           --- It divides the Moabites from their brethren, the children of Ammon, who lay to the north-east. The Hebrews encamped on
                           the south side of this river, in the desert of Cademoth, (Deuteronomy ii. 26,) whence they sent to ask leave of Sehon to pass
                           through his dominions; but, on his refusal, God ordered them to cross the Arnon by force. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           book of the wars,</I> &amp;c. An ancient book, which, like several others quoted in Scripture, has been lost. (Challoner)
                           --- St. Augustine (q. 42) thinks this book was written by one of that country. Others believe that Moses wrote a more detailed
                           account of the wars which he had to wage with the Amalecites, (Exodus xvii. 14,) and these other nations, out of which he
                           has only inserted some of the heads in the Pentateuch. But whether these two verses were taken from another work of Moses,
                           or from the history of some other person, they are now of divine authority. Saul says to David, (1 Kings xviii. 17,) <I>fight
                           the battles of the Lord,....and the children of God and of Ruben pass all armed for war before the Lord,</I> (chap xxxii.
                           29.; Calmet) whence it appears, that the wars of the Hebrews were attributed to God. Tostat is of opinion, that the <I>Book
                           of the Just,</I> is the same with that to which Moses here refers. See Josue x. 13., and 2 Kings i. 18. But Theodoret thinks
                           rather, that the former was a more extensive account of the transactions of Josue, out of which the book which bears his name
                           was compiled. Such records certainly existed, to which the sacred historians frequently refer: and it is very probable, that
                           a work of this nature was compiled in the days of Moses, or perhaps before his time. (St. Augustine, City of God xviii.) As
                           it contained a prediction, respecting the future wars, in which the Hebrews were about to engage, it could not but make a
                           suitable impression upon them. It might already be in every one's mouth, and the Hebrew may insinuate, that it would be handed
                           down to the latest posterity: "Wherefore in the history, <I>or</I> account of the wars of the Lord, this also <I>shall be
                           </I>mentioned," <I>jamor, dicetur.</I> According to this interpretation, it would not be necessary to suppose, that Moses
                           refers to any more ancient book, as <I>sepher</I> means also, "a narration" by word of mouth; and Rabbi Menachem believes,
                           that God had revealed this event to Moses, encouraging him with the assurance, that he would give him the victory over the
                           nations bordering upon the Arnon, as he had done over the Egyptians and Amalecites at the Red Sea. See Sixt. Senens. (Haydock)
                           --- <I>Of Arnon,</I> the waters of which are supposed to have given the Hebrews a passage, as the Chaldean asserts on the
                           authority of Psalm lxxiii. 15. Habacuc (iii. 13) also mentions that several rivers were dried up by God. The Hebrew text is
                           almost unintelligible, "From, <I>or</I> against, Vaheb to Supha." As there is no verb, some translate, "he (Sehon) fought
                           against Vaheb (Grotius reads Moab) at Supha, <I>or</I> he came to <I>Veb.</I>" Some render this word, <EM>he made,</EM> "a
                           whirlpool in the torrents of Arnon." But Calmet would substitute Zared instead of Vaheb: "The <I>encamped</I> at the torrent
                           of Zared, and came to Supha, (Deuteronomy i. 1, where we read <I>the Red Sea</I>) to the torrent of Arnon." Protestants translate,
                           "What he did in the Red Sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, (16) and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling
                           of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab." (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           while the rivers were also dried up. Hebrew, "They <I>encamped</I> on the stream of the torrents, which bends towards the
                           dwelling (or city) of Ar, and rests upon the frontiers of Moab." Thus the book to which Moses alludes, confirms his account
                           of these different encampments. (Calmet) --- The Septuagint give rather a different turn of these two verses: "Hence it is
                           said in a book, The war of the Lord has burnt Zoob and the torrents of Arnon---and has sent the torrents to inhabit Er: and
                           it lies upon the borders of Moab." The river, it seems, had been removed out of its bead by a subterraneous fire or earthquake,
                           and deluged the city of Ar, belonging to Moab. The mighty hand of God terrified those nations, while all nature fought <I>against</I>
