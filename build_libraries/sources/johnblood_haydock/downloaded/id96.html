                           here the malice of the Pharisees; they were more hurt at the cure of the sick man, than at the violation of the sabbath. Therefore,
                           they ask not, Who healed you; but, as if they wished to keep that out of sight, Who told you to take up you bed? (St. Chrysostom)
                           --- But he answers: The same who healed me: Why should I not receive orders from him from whom I have received my health?
                           (St. Augustine) --- By the festival, mentioned in ver. 1, is generally understood the Passover; and this was the second from
                           the commencement of Christ's ministry. St. Matthew calls it by this name, chap. xxvi. 5; St. Mark, Chap. xiv. 2. and xv. 6;
                           and St. Luke, Chap. xxiii. 17. For the first Passover, see above, John ii. 13; for the third, John vi. 4; for the fourth and
                           last, Matthew xxvi. 17. The first three are only mentioned by St. John, the fourth by all the evangelists.</FONT></P><B>

                           there is at Jerusalem a pond,</I> called <I>Probatica.</I>[1] Some translate, the <I>sheep-pond.</I> It is true the Greek
                           word signifies something belonging to <I>sheep.</I> But because the ancient Latin interpreter thought fit to retain the Greek,
                           <I>probatica,</I> and also because of the different expositions, I have not changed the word. Some think it was so called,
                           as being near the gate called the <I>sheep-gate:</I> others, as being near the <I>sheep-market:</I> others, because the sheep
                           that were brought to be sacrificed, were washed in it; or, at least, that the blood and entrails of sheep and beast sacrificed,
                           were thrown into it, or washed there. In the ordinary Greek copies we read thus: there is <I>at,</I> or <I>near,</I> the Probatica,
                           a <I>pond</I> or <I>fish-pond.</I> In Hebrew it was called <I>Bethsaida,</I> a house for fishing: and in most Greek copies,
                           <I>Bethchesda, a house of mercy,</I> (perhaps because of the cures done there) having <I>five porches,</I> covered and arched,
                           for the convenience of the infirm that lay there, waiting for the motion of the water. (Witham) --- The word&nbsp;<I><U>probaton</U>,</I>
                           signifies a sheep. This pond is therefore called Probatica, because there the priests washed the sacrifices. (St. Augustine)
                           --- In imitation of this sick man, if we wish to return God thanks for his favours, or to enjoy the pleasure of his company,
                           we must fly the crowd of vain and wicked thoughts that continually tempt us; we must avoid the company of the wicked, and
                           fly to the sanctuary, that we may render our hearts worthy temples of that God who vouchsafes to visit us. (Alcuin)</FONT></P><B>

                           interpreters, expound it of a true angel, and of a miraculous cure: so that I cannot but wonder that so learned a man as Dr.
                           Hammond, should rather judge these cures to have been natural. By the <I>angel,</I> he would have us to understand a messenger
                           sent from the temple, who was to stir up the blood, and the grosser and thicker parts from the bottom of the pond, and that
                           these cures were made much after the same manner, as, in some cases, persons find a cure by being put into the belly of a
                           beast newly opened. Into what extravagant interpretations are men of learning sometimes led by their private judgment! What
                           scholar of Galen or Hippocrates, ever pretended that this was a certain and infallible cure for all manner of diseases? Yet
                           here we read: that <I>he</I> who <I>got first into this pond, after the motion of the water, was healed, whatsoever distemper
                           he was seized with.</I> The <I>blind</I> are particularly named: Is this a certain remedy that restores sight to the blind?
                           (Witham) --- The effect produced could not be natural, as only one was cured at each motion of the waters. The longing expectation
                           of the suffering patients, is a mark of the persevering prayer with which poor sinners should solicit the cure of their spiritual
                           infirmities. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           are covered with the leprosy of sin, we are frequently insensible of our misfortune; whereas, as soon as the body is attacked
                           with sickness, though ever so inconsiderable, we are not to be pacified till the physician has been consulted, and some remedy
                           applied to remove, if possible, the complaint. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxvii. in Joan.) --- Men are astonished that God, for
                           so short a pleasure as is found in the perpetration of sin, should have decreed an everlasting punishment in the fire of hell;
                           for they say, Shall I be punished for ever, for having indulged a sinful thought for a single moment? But their astonishment
                           will cease, when they consider that punishments are not inflicted on sins in proportion to the length of time that was spent
                           in their perpetration, but that they are proportioned to their malice. Now the malice of sin being infinite, aimed against
                           the infinite majesty and infinite sanctity of God, the punishment, to be any ways commensurate, must be infinite. If, therefore,
                           the sinner dies charged with the infinite debt of mortal sin unrepented of, as the time of mercy and repentance finishes with
                           the present life, the sin must necessarily remain, God's hatred for sin must necessarily remain, and the punishment justly
                           inflicted must necessarily continue. (Haydock) --- These words are applicable to every penitent sinner, when he returns from
                           the tribunal of confession, and shew how careful he ought to be not to relapse into his former sins. "For he who after pardon
                           sins again, is unworthy of mercy; who being cured, makes himself sick again, and who being cleansed, defiles himself again."

                           father worketh until now:</I>[3] <I>and I work.</I> The Jews looked upon it of obligation to do nothing on the sabbath, because
                           God is said to have <I>rested the seventh day;</I> on which account the <I>rest</I> on the seventh day was commanded. Christ
                           puts them in mind, that though it be said <I>he rested the seventh day,</I> (that is, produced no more new kinds of creatures)
                           yet that God may be said to work always, by preserving and continually governing the world: <I>and I,</I> saith he, do all
                           things that he doth, <I>I work</I> with him, being one and the same in nature and substance with him: nay, even as man, I
                           do nothing but what is conformable to his will; and so you need not fear that I break the sabbath. --- The Christian faith
                           teacheth us, that Jesus Christ was both God and Man. The objections of the ancient and modern <I>Arians,</I> only shew that
                           Christ was also truly a man, and that divers things which he speaks of himself, or which are said of him in the holy Scriptures,
                           apply to him as man. Nothing is more certain, and agreed on by all. But at the same time we ought to take notice, that Christ
                           has affirmed many things of himself, and many things are asserted of him in the Scriptures, which by no means could be applied
                           to him unless he were also truly and properly one and the same God with his eternal Father. And these are the passages by
                           which the Arians and Socinians might be convinced of their errors and blasphemies. (Witham) --- If Christ had not been the
                           natural Son of God, these words, which he says in excuse of his seeming breach of the sabbath, would rather have increased
                           the strength of their accusation. For no governor, when accused of any crime, excuses himself by saying the king does the
                           same. But as the Son is equal to the Father, his excuse is a true one. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxvii. in Joan.) --- The rest
                           God entered into after the creation, and which he was pleased to honour by that of the sabbath, is no hinderance to the operations
                           of his power in the preservation of his works, nor to the operations of his grace in the sanctification of souls.</FONT></P><B>

                           him equal to God, and that he <I>made himself God.</I> See John x. 33; John xix. 7; Luke xxii. 70; &amp;c. And therefore St.

                           Son cannot do any thing of himself,</I>[5] <I>but what he seeth the Father do.</I> In like manner, (ver. 30.) Christ says,
                           <I>I can do nothing of myself. As I hear, so I judge.</I> Again (Chap. viii. 28.) <I>I do nothing of myself; but as the Father
                           hath taught me, I speak these things.</I> All these, and the like expressions, may be expounded, with Maldonatus and Petavius,
                           (lib. ii. de Trin. chap. 4.) of Christ, as man. But the ancient Fathers commonly allowed them to be understood of Christ as
                           God, and as the true Son of God proceeding from him from all eternity; as when it is said, <I>the Son cannot do any thing
                           of himself,</I> it is true, because the eternal <I>Son is not of himself,</I> but always proceeds from the Father. 2. Because
                           the <I>works</I> of all the three Persons, by which all things are produced and preserved, are inseparable. 3. When it is
                           said, that the Son doth nothing, but what he <I>seeth</I> the Father doing: that <I>he heareth,</I> as the Father hath <I>taught</I>
                           him, <I>or shewed</I> to him: these expressions bear not the same sense as when they are applied to men, or to an inferior
                           or a scholar, who learns of his master, and follows him; but here, says St. Augustine, to <I>see,</I> to <I>hear,</I> to <I>be
                           taught by the Father,</I> is no more than to proceed from him, to do and produce by the same action, all that the Father doth
                           and produceth. This is the general interpretation of the ancient Fathers: St. Athanasius, St. Basil, St. Gregory of Nazianzus,
                           St. Chrysostom, St. Cyril, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine. The words immediately following, confirm this exposition, when it is
                           said: <I>For what things soever he </I>(the Father) <I>doth, these also in like manner the Son doth,</I> i.e. the very same
                           things by an unity of nature, of will, and of action: nor could these words be true, unless the Son was the same true God
                           with the Father. (Witham) --- This must be understood, that he cannot do any thing contrary to the will of the Father. He
                           does not say, "The Son does nothing of himself, but the Son can do nothing of himself, in order to shew their likeness and
                           perfect equality." For by saying this, he does not betray any want of power in the Son; but, on the contrary, shews his great
                           power. For when we say that God cannot sin, we do not esteem it a want of power; so when the Son says he cannot do any thing
                           of himself, his meaning is, that he cannot do any thing contrary to the will of the Father; which certainly is a great perfection.

                           as man; but the ancient interpreters understand them of Christ, as God, in this sense, that the Father, and the Son, or the

                           by the Son; but that the Father raises those whom the Son raises. And lest any one should understand this, that the Father
                           makes use of the Son as his minister, through whose means he raises the dead, he immediately adds, &amp;c. (St. Augustine,
                           Tract. xxi. in Joan.) --- We see the lovers of this temporal and perishable life, labour to the utmost of their power, I will
                           not say to avoid death, but merely to prolong their frail existence. If, therefore, men labour with so much solicitude, if
                           they strain every nerve to prolong their lives but for a few years; how foolish and blind to their interest must those be,
                           who live in such a manner as to be deprived of the light of eternal day! (St. Augustine, De verb. Dni. Serm. 64.)</FONT></P><B>

                           would not receive him to whom all those Scriptures gave testimony, and through whom alone they could have that true life.
                           (Challoner) --- This hope is the cause and motive which leads to this study; and eternal life is the end they propose to themselves

                           holy Scriptures. The council of Trent, (Session v., chap. i. de reform.) makes this proviso; that in churches where there
                           exists a prebendary, or benefice, set apart for lectures on sacred Scripture, the bishops, &amp;c. shall compel those holding
                           such benefice to expound the sacred Scriptures themselves, should they be equal to the duty; or, by a proper substitute, chosen
                           by the bishop or local ordinary. Also in monasteries of monks, it is prescribed that if abbots neglect, let the bishops of
                           the places compel their compliance; and in convents where studies can be conveniently prosecuted, let there be also a lecturer
                           on Scripture appointed, to be chosen from the most able professors. Moreover, in public universities, where this most honorable
                           and most necessary of all lectures has not been instituted, let the piety and charity of religious princes and governments
                           provide for it; so that the Catholic faith may be defended and strengthened, and sound doctrine protected and propagated.
                           And where the lecture has been instituted, but discontinued, let it be re-established. Moreover, no one was to be appointed
                           to this office, whose life, morals, and learning had not been examined and approved by the bishop of the place, &amp;c.</FONT></P><B>
