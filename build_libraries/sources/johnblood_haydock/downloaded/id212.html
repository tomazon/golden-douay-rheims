                           the gospel had spread itself through the whole world by the preaching not only of the apostles, but of their disciples, and
                           by the noise which this new religion made. (Calmet) --- St. Augustine sheweth with St. Paul, that the Church and Christ's
                           gospel was to grow daily, and to spread all over the world; which cannot stand with what heretics allude of the failure of
                           the Church, nor with their own obscure conventicles. (ep. lxxx. ad finem.)</FONT></P><B>

                           nothing certain is known. We may here observe, that the Holy Spirit proportions itself and speaks according to our ideas of
                           a temporal kingdom, in which one authority is subject to another. In the same manner the Angels seem subordinate to one another.
                           (St. Dionysius in Calmet) --- <I>All things were created by him, and in him,</I> and[3] <I>consist</I> in him. If all things
                           that are were made by him, he himself was not made. And his divine power is also signified, when it is said all things consist

                           of Christ, for a sufficient and superabundant redemption of mankind, and therefore he adds, <I>for his body, which is the

                           body, the Church, and his members, the faithful. (Challoner) --- St. Chrysostom here observes that Jesus Christ loves us so
                           much, that he is not content merely to suffer in his own person, but he wishes also to suffer in his members; and thus we
                           fill up what is wanting of the sufferings of Christ. (St. Chrysostom) --- The wisdom, the will, the justice of Jesus Christ,
                           requireth and ordaineth that his body and members should be companions of his sufferings, as they expect to be companions
                           of his glory; that so suffering with him, and after his example, they may apply to their own wants and to the necessities
                           of others the merits and satisfaction of Jesus Christ, which <I>application</I> is what is wanting, and what we are permitted
                           to supply by the sacraments and sacrifice of the new law.</FONT></P><B>
