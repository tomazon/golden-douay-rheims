                           Jesus Christ) that St. John the Baptist said: "Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world." (John i. 29.)
                           (Witham) --- Here again Jesus Christ is plainly marked out, the Lamb of God, the victim of expiation, who by his death has
                           reconciled us with his Father; and who, even in heaven, bears the marks of his passion, and by the wounds therein received
                           continually inclines his Father to shew us mercy. He has seven horns, as so many crowns and marks of his omnipotence; and
                           seven eyes, to represent his infinite knowledge and wisdom. (Calmet) --- <I>Having seven horns and seven eyes,</I> (to signify
                           his power and his knowledge,) <I>which are the seven spirits</I> subject to Christ. See Chap. i. 4. It is observed that in
                           the Revelation of St. John, the number seven is divers times applied to signify a multitude, and a number implying perfection,
                           and three and a half for a small number. Thus are represented the seven candlesticks, seven churches, seven spirits, seven
                           seals, seven trumpets, seven vials, &amp;c. (Witham)</FONT></P>

                           a sign that he would open it)...<I>the four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb,</I> to adore him, as appears by
                           what follows, ver. 13. --- <I>Having every one of them harps</I> to celebrate his praise, <I>and golden vials full of odours,

                           represent these four and twenty ancients as so many senators, who present to the Almighty the prayers and homages of good
                           men on earth. (Estius; Clement of Alexandria) --- This also is an imitation of what was practised in the temple, in which
                           were always around the altar, in times of sacrifice, Levites with musical instruments, priests with vials to contain the wine
                           and blood, and censers to hold the incense (Calmet) --- <I>The prayers of the saints.</I> Here we see that the saints in heaven

                           New canticles are always more agreeable, says Pindar. (Grotius) --- <I>And hast redeemed,</I> &amp;c. The twenty-four ancients
