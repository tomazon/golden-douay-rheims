                                    themselves upon the ground, putting ashes upon their heads, praying, with one accord, that the God of Israel would shew his
                                    mercy upon his people.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And taking their arms of war, they posted themselves at the places,
                                    which by a narrow path-way lead directly between the mountains, and they guarded them all day and night.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 Now Holofernes, in going round about, found that the fountain which
                                    supplied them with water, ran through an aqueduct without the city, on the south side: and he commanded their aqueduct to
                                    be cut off.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 Nevertheless, there were springs not far from the walls, out of which
                                    they were seen secretly to draw water, to refresh themselves a little rather than to drink their fill.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 But the children of Ammon, and Moab, came to Holofernes, saying: The
                                    children of Israel trust not in their spears, nor in their arrows, but the mountains are their defense, and the steep hires
                                    and precipices guard them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Wherefore, that thou mayst overcome them without joining battle, set
                                    guards at the springs, that they may not draw water out of them, and thou shalt destroy them without sword, or at least being
                                    wearied out, they will yield up their city, which they suppose, because it is situate in the mountains, to be impregnable.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And these words pleased Holofernes, and his officers, and he placed
                                    all round about a hundred men at every spring.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And when they had kept this watch for full twenty days, the cisterns,
                                    and the reserve of waters, failed among all the inhabitants of Bethulia, so that there was not within the city enough to satisfy
                                    them, no not for one day, for water was daily given out to the people by measure.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 Then all the men and women, young men, and children, gathering themselves
                                    together to Ozias, all together with one voice,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 Said: *God be judge between us and thee, for thou hast done evil against
                                    us, in that thou wouldst not speak peaceably with the Assyrians, and for this cause God hath sold us into their hands.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And therefore there is no one to help us, while we are cast down before
                                    their eyes in thirst, and sad destruction.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And now, assemble ye all that are in the city, that we may, of our
                                    own accord, yield ourselves all up to the people of Holofernes.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 For it is better that, being captives, we should live and bless the
                                    Lord, than that we should die, and be a reproach to all flesh, after we have seen our wives and our infants die before our
                                    eyes.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 We call to witness this day heaven and earth, and the God of our fathers,
                                    who taketh vengeance upon us according to our sins, conjuring you to deliver now the city into the hand of the army of Holofernes,
                                    that our end may be short by the edge of the sword, which is made longer by the drought of thirst.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And when they had said these things, there was great weeping and lamentation
                                    of all in the assembly, and for many hours with one voice they cried to God, saying:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 *We have sinned with our fathers, we have done unjustly, we have commited
                                    iniquity:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 Have thou mercy on us, because thou art good, or punish our iniquities,
                                    by chastising us thyself, and deliver not them that trust in thee to a people that knoweth not thee,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 That they may not say among the Gentiles: Where is their God?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And when, being wearied with these cries, and tired with these weepings,
                                    they held their peace,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Ozias, rising up all in tears, said: Be of good courage, my brethren,
                                    and let us wait these five days for mercy from the Lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 For perhaps he will put a stop to his indignation, and will give glory
                                    to his own name.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 But, if after five days be past, there come no aid, we will do the
