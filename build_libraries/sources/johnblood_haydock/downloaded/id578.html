                           He probably informed his parents (Haydock) that he was inspired <I>by the Lord,</I> ver. 4. (Worthington) --- The Jews say
                           that he had first converted this woman; and interpreters generally excuse his conduct. But St. Ambrose thinks that he forfeited
                           God's grace; (ep. 19) and Theodoret also supposes that he transgressed the law, (Exodus xxxiv. 12.) and God only permitted
                           him to fall in love with women, without approving his conduct, q. 21. The Scripture often says, that he does and wills what
                           he only permits, Exodus iv. 21., and Josue xi. 20. (Calmet) --- If the conversion of this woman were well attested, there
                           would be no difficulty about his marrying her, as Salmon did Rahab, St. Matthew i. 5. We have only conjectures that the women
                           whom these and other holy personages espoused, embraced the true faith. But these may suffice in a matter of this nature.
                           We cannot condemn Samson on this occasion, without involving his parents in the same censure, as they were charged to keep
                           him from any contamination. St. Ambrose justly observes that a woman was the occasion of his fall, but he might allude to
                           Dalilia, chap. xvi. 4. It seems hard to pass sentence on this judge of Israel, on his first appearance, without the most cogent
                           reasons. See Lyranus, Cornelius a Lapide, &amp;c. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "She is right in my eyes." His parents were at length
                           convinced that he was directed by God. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           honeycomb.</I> There was a very remarkable providence in this particular of the history of Samson. From which also in the
                           mystical sense we may learn what spiritual sweetness and nourishment our souls will acquire from slaying the lions of our
                           passions and vices. (Challoner) --- Samson waited some time before he went to celebrate his marriage. The Rabbins say a full
                           year was the usual term after the espousals; (Esther ii. 12,) and many have translated "after a year." (Chaldean, Arabic,
                           &amp;c.) During this space the flesh of the lion would be consumed, and bees might make honey in its skeleton. Herodotus (v.
                           114,) informs us that a swarm lodged in the skull of Onesylus, the tyrant of Cyprus, which had been suspended for a long time.

                           lion, in the same manner as Virgil (iv.) describes them proceeding from a young ox beaten to death, and covered with boughs,
                           in a place closely shut up. The bees might have laid their eggs upon these boughs, and the grass upon which an ox feeds, &amp;c.
                           But none of these precautions were taken with the lion which Samson tore in pieces. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Before the nuptials, the young man was not accustomed to go to the house of his future bride. (Montanus) --- Samson's mother

                           Such obscure and ingenious questions were much liked in the East, 3 Kings x. 1. The Egyptians concealed the mysteries of their
                           religion, and Pythagoras his choicest maxims under them. (St. Clement of Alexandria, strom. 5.) The Greeks proposed the&nbsp;<I><U>griphous</U></I>
                           at feasts, determining some reward or punishment to those who succeeded or failed to explain them. Athenæus (x. 22,) relates
                           that Simonides proposed this to his companions, after he had seen a blacksmith asleep, with a skin of wine and a craw-fish
                           beside him. "The father of the kid, which eateth all sorts of herbs, and the miserable fish knocked their heads against each
                           other, and he who has received upon his eye-lids the son of the night, would not feed the minister, who kills the oxen of
                           king Bacchus." He could not get his ax mended. The ancients kept their wine in skins of kids, &amp;c., whence he alludes to
                           the bottle of wine, near the miserable craw-fish or lobster. --- <I>Shirts.</I> Hebrew <I>sedinim,</I> "sindons," the garment
                           which was worn next the skin, Mark xiv. 51. It was used also by women, (Isaias iii. 23,) and is probably the same which is
                           called a <I>tunic.</I> (Calmet) --- <I>Coats.</I> Hebrew, "change of garments." Some understand new and splendid garments.
                           But Samson complied with his promise, by giving such as he found upon the 30 men, whom he slew, ver. 19. (Haydock) --- The
                           custom of making presents of garments has long prevailed in the East. The Turkish emperor still receives and makes such presents
                           to ambassadors. (Calmet) --- Their long robes may easily be made to fit any person. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           The explication of the ancient riddles frequently depended on the knowledge of something that had taken place. Our riddle-makers
                           follow other rules. In a spiritual sense, the Philistines might be considered as those strong ones who had domineered over
                           Israel, but would shortly afford them the spoils of a glorious victory. Jesus rises triumphant from the grave, and, after
                           he has been persecuted and torn in pieces, becomes the food of Christians. (St. Augustine, &amp;c.) (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           to draw the secret from him. She tried; but the seventh day being come, or at hand, (Menochius) the men began to threaten
                           her, so that she became more importunate, and obtained her request. She had been weeping during a great part of the seven
                           days, (ver. 17.; Calmet) or perhaps she had begun to tease him from the beginning. (Menochius) --- <I>Strip us.</I> Septuagint,

                           with white linen garments. These companions of Samson fear that they are going to be losers, by the honour which they do him.

                           Samson must no longer be considered as a private man. He was authorized by the Spirit of the Lord, thus to punish the oppressors
                           of Israel. (Calmet) --- Though these 30 men had done him no injury in person, (Haydock) they had sinned against God, and deserved

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And he went down, and spoke to the woman that had pleased his eyes.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And after some days, returning to take her, he went aside to see the
                                    carcass of the lion, and behold there was a swarm of bees in the mouth of the lion, and a honey-comb.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And when he had taken it in his hands, he went on eating: and coming

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 So his father went down to the woman, and made a feast for his son

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And when the citizens of that place saw him, they brought him thirty

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And Samson said to them: I will propose to you a riddle, which if
                                    you declare unto me within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty shirts, and as many coats:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 But if you shall not be able to declare it, you shall give me thirty
                                    shirts and the same number of coats. They answered him: Put forth the riddle, that we may hear it.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And he said to them: Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of
                                    the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not for three days expound the riddle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And when the seventh day came, they said to the wife of Samson: Sooth
                                    thy husband, and persuade him to tell thee what the riddle meaneth. But if thou wilt not do it, we will burn thee, and thy
                                    father's house. Have you called us to the wedding on purpose to strip us?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 So she wept before Samson and complained, saying: Thou hatest me,
                                    and dost not love me: therefore thou wilt not expound to me the riddle, which thou hast proposed to the sons of my people.
                                    But he answered: I would not tell it to my father and mother: and how can I tell it to thee?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 So she wept before him the seven days of the feast: and, at length,
                                    on the seventh day, as she was troublesome to him, he expounded it. And she immediately told her countrymen.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And they, on the seventh day before the sun went down, said to him:
                                    What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them: If you had not ploughed with my heifer,
                                    you had not found out my riddle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to Ascalon,

                                    angry, he went up to his father's house:</font></p>
