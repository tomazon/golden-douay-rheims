                           <I>presbyter,</I> always puts <I>elders.</I> Yet they of the Church of England allow, and maintain, that by this Greek word
                           in this, and many other places, are signified the ministers of God, known by the name of <I>bishops</I> or priests, according
                           to the ecclesiastical use of the same word. It is evident that here are not meant elders, as to age and years. Nay, though
                           we adhere to the grammatical signification, we should rather translate priests, since the English word <I>priest,</I> as well
                           as the French word <I><SPAN lang=EN>prêtre</SPAN>,</I> come from <I>presbyter.</I> But of this word more hereafter. We may
                           also take notice, that the Calvinists here translate, <I>ordained by election,</I> pretending by the derivation of the Greek
                           word, that church ministers were only chosen, and deputed by the votes and suffrages of people; and not by any ordination,
                           or consecration by a bishop; nor by any character or sacrament of order. But their argument from this Greek word is frivolous,
                           and groundless, as hath been shewn by Mr. Bois on this verse, by Mr. Legh in his Critica Sacra, &amp;c. (Witham) --- We see
                           from this text, 1st, that Sts. Paul and Barnabas were bishops, having authority to confer holy orders: 2nd. that there was
                           even then a difference betwixt bishops and priests, though the name in the primitive Church was often used indifferently;
                           3rd. that fasting and praying were constant preparatives for holy orders. (Bristow)</FONT></P><B>
