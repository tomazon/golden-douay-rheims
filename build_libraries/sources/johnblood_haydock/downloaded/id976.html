                           own subjects at Lobna, a Levitical city in Juda, also abandoned him. Dreadful evils were denounced in a letter from the prophet
                           Elias, who had been translated to paradise nine years before, and at last the honours of sepulture were denied to the wicked

                           has here <i><u>Ochozias</u>;</i> as the other versions have also <i>Ochozias,</i> (chap. xxii. 6.) instead of Azrieu, (Haydock)

                           No person could receive the usual honours of burial, if his accusers could maintain their charge against his character before
                           a court of above forty people, assembled for the purpose. Calumny was severely punished. But the kings themselves were to
                           stand their trial, while their corpse was placed in the porch of the monument, and the priest spoke their funeral oration.
                           The people testified their approbation or discontent, "and many of the kings have been deprived of a glorious and legal burial,
