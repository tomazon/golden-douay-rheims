                           Paul continues to justify his not coming to them as he promised. He told them that he did not wish to domineer over their
                           faith, but that his whole design was to contribute to their joy, and that he did not wish to visit them as long as any thing
                           remained worthy of correction, lest his presence should only increase their sorrow. And if in his former epistle he made use
                           of strong expressions, it was not through any design to make them sad, but merely to correct them, by which he manifested
                           his great charity for them. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           guilty of incest, whom he brought to sorrow and repentance, by excommunicating him in his former epistle, and now St. Paul
                           rejoiceth at his conversion. (Witham) --- The meaning of the apostle is, that if I had come to you in order to make you sorrowful,
                           what pleasure could I have derived from your grief, since you are the only persons who can afford me any, the least comfort?
                           What motives could have influenced me to undertake so disagreeable a mission? This is more fully explained in the following
                           verse, which shows this to be the reason why he had written to them. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           me,</I> that is, not me only, but all the virtuous Christians at Corinth: <I>but in part, that I may not charge you all</I>
                           with this fault. The sense seems to be, <I>but in part,</I> that is, it was only one man, and some that joined with him, by
                           showing themselves unconcerned for his scandalous crime, so that I do not blame the rest: or as it was <I>but in part,</I>
                           that is, it was only a passing trouble for a little time, since by admonitions and severities, he soon repented. (Witham)
                           --- When last I wrote to you, I was in great anguish on account of the crime of the incestuous man; but my grief was moderated
                           by the consideration of the behaviour of the rest of the Church of Corinth, which had remained steadfast in faith and virtue.
                           (St. Gregory and St. Augustine) --- It is not the whole Church of Corinth that has caused me this grief, but only one of you:
                           I say this, that you may not believe that I wished to charge you all with this crime. (Grotius)</FONT></P><B>

                           --- Others explain it thus: I have written this second letter to you to try your obedience, and to know if you will pay the
                           same obedience to my orders, when I tell you to receive the incestuous man into your communion, as you did when I told you

                           B.C.]. (Estius) --- Here, though there was a great promise of abundant fruit, St. Paul's solicitude to meet Titus, that he

                           is fit to discharge this great duty, without the continual assistance of God's grace? The reading of the Latin Vulgate seems
                           to agree better with the following verse of the next chapter, when he answers their objection, <I>Do we then begin again to
                           commend ourselves?</I> (Witham) --- Who are so fit as we who are chosen by God to fulfil his ministry? If God had not chosen
                           us, how should we have been able to acquit ourselves of so arduous an undertaking? for we did not intrude or thrust ourselves
                           into this ministry. (Calmet) ---Though it is not so difficult for those to preach the gospel who corrupt its doctrines, who
                           weaken its truths, who disguise its obligations, and who mix the word of God with human inventions in order to be more esteemed,
                           or for the sake of filthy lucre, like those who mix and adulterate their wines, in order to be the greater gainers. (St.&nbsp;Chrysostom)
                           --- But we preach the word in all sincerity, as on the part of God, in the presence of God, and in the Spirit and person of
                           Jesus Christ. (Bible de Vence) --- In this grand work all may justly tremble, for who is fit? as we read in the Greek.</P>
