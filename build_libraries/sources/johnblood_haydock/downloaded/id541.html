                           Achan was guilty of theft: some of the rest might have connived at his fault. He had taken what was reserved for the Lord.
                           The offender was discovered, to inspire all with a horror for his conduct. Some of his brethren were punished, (ver. 5,) but
                           they suffered for their own secret transgressions, or death might be no real punishment to them; while the Israelites were
                           awakened to a sense of their own inability to conquer without the divine protection, and were forced to humble themselves.
                           (Haydock) --- Chastisements are the marks of God's displeasure, though they frequently proceed also from his clemency. ---
                           <I>Achan</I> is called <I>Achar,</I> 1 Paralipomenon ii. 7. These five persons occupy the space of 265 years; so that they

                           destroying 36, and putting the rest to flight. (Calmet) --- This small disaster filled the whole camp with dismay, as the

                           Hebrew, "it shall be the tribe which the Lord taketh." (Haydock) --- This was done by lots, as on similar occasions, 1 Kings
                           x. 20., and xiv. 41. When God authorized this method, there could be no danger in it. But to have recourse to lots without
                           such authority, would be often tempting God. The apostles chose an apostle by lot: but they had first taken every precaution
                           (Calmet) to select two persons, both fit for the important charge. (Haydock) --- To commit the choice of sacred ministers
                           to chance would be extremely improper. "We forbid the use of lots in the elections," said Honorius. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hence some have drawn a very weak argument, to prove the repentance of Achan, as if he had only to undergo a temporary punishment.
                           It is probable, however, that his sincere confession, proceeding from a penitent heart, might influence God to shew him mercy.

                           or perhaps at his person, while he was burning at the stake, as it is the custom still among the Turks. (Roger. ii. 7.) The
