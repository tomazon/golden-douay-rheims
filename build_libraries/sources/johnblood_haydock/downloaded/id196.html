                           By the child, in this place, the apostle understands all the Jewish people, who, as long as they were under the childhood
                           of the law, were subject to numerous restrictions, although they were the favorite children of God. But when the fulness of
                           time came, they received the adoption of children, and were in possession of the liberty of the law of grace. They were no
                           longer obliged to observe the legal rites. Whence the apostle wishes the conclusion to be drawn, that if persons once subject
                           to the law were now exempt from it, how much more will those be excused from its yoke, who were never under its control. (Calmet)</FONT></DIV></BLOCKQUOTE><B>

                           precise. The Galatians, whom he addresses, had been converted from paganism, and of course were never subject to the law of
                           Moses. But the apostle, by these words, entreats them not to begin now to serve these weak and useless elements, (as he calls
                           the Jewish rites) or by this expression he may mean (as St. Chrysostom and Theophylactus explain it) the tyranny of error
                           and wickedness. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>You observe</I> [1] <I>days,</I> &amp;c. These false teachers were for obliging all Christians to observe all the Jewish
                           feasts, fasts, ceremonies, &amp;c. Some of the later reformers find here an occasion to blame the fasts and holydays kept
                           by Catholics. St. Jerome, in his commentary on these words, tells us that some had made the like objection in his time: his
                           answer might reasonably stop their rashness; to wit, that Christians keep indeed the sabbath on the Sunday, (not the Jewish
                           sabbath on Saturdays) that they keep also divers holydays, and days on which great saints suffered martyrdom, (let our adversaries
                           take notice of this) but that both the days are different, and the motives of keeping them. See St. Jerome, tom. iv. p. 271.
                           (Witham) --- This text cannot mean to condemn the feasts appointed to be kept holy in the Catholic Church. For on the festivals
                           dedicated to our Lord, St. Augustine writeth thus: "We dedicate and consecrate the memory of God's benefits with solemnities
                           on solemn appointed days, lest in process of time they might creep into ungrateful and unkind oblivion." And of the martyrs
                           thus: "Christian people celebrate the memories of martyrs with religious solemnity, both to move themselves to an imitation
                           of their virtues, and that they may be partakers of their merits, and helped by their prayers." (Conta Faust. lib. xx. chap.
                           21.) And of other saints thus: "keep ye and celebrate with sobriety the nativity of saints, that we may imitate them that
                           are gone before us, and that they may rejoice in us, who pray for us." (In Ps. lxxxviii. Conc. 2. in fine.)</FONT></P><B>

                           her children,</I> who remain under the <I>servitude</I> of the law of Moses: we cannot understand a <I>conjunction,</I> or
                           an <I>affinity,</I> as to place and situation, Sina and Jerusalem being near twenty days' journey distant from each other;
                           therefore it can only be an affinity in a mystical signification, inasmuch as Jerusalem was the capital of the Jews, where
                           the children of those who received the law on Mount Sina lived still under the servitude of the same law: but Christians,
                           who believe in Christ, must look upon themselves as belonging to Jerusalem, and not to the city of Jerusalem upon earth, but
                           to the celestial Jerusalem in heaven, which is our <I>mother,</I> now no longer servants and slaves to the former law, but
                           <I>free,</I> being made the <I>sons</I> of God by the grace of Christ, and heirs of heaven. And these blessings were promised
                           to all nations, not only to the Jews, of which the much greater part remained obstinate, and refused to believe in Christ,
                           but also particularly to the Gentiles, according to the prophecy of Isaias, (chap. liv.) <I>rejoice thou</I> that hast been
