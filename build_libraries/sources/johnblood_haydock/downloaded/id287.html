                           <EM>The</EM> Apocalypse, or <EM>Revelation.</EM> I rather prefer the word Apocalypse, which the Latin interpreter did not
                           think fit to change. --- <I>Of Jesus Christ....by his Angel,</I> sent <I>to his servant John.</I> So that these things were
                           immediately revealed to St. John by an Angel, who represented and spoke in the person of Christ.--- <I>Which must shortly
                           come;</I> and as it is again said, (ver. 3.) <I>the time is at hand.</I> This cannot be meant of all things in the Apocalypse,
                           where mention is also made of the day of judgment, and of the glory of heaven at the end of the world. It can only mean, that
                           some things were to happen shortly, i.e. what is said of the seven churches. (Chap. ii. and iii.) Or the persecutions foretold
                           should begin shortly. Or else these expressions are only to signify, that all time is short, and that from the coming of the
                           Messias, we are now in the last age, or the <I>last hour.</I> See 1 John ii. 18. (Witham) --- St. John excites their attention
                           by the most pressing motives, the approach of the events. Whatever explanation be given of this book, it is equally true in
                           all, that the time is at hand, when it will begin to be accomplished. To find our consolation and happiness in this sacred
                           book, according to the promise of the Holy Spirit, we must peruse it with faith and humility, receive the interpretation of
                           the Church with submission and docility, and practise the truths contained with fidelity and promptitude. What is the life
                           of man, since ages are but moments that escape us? Eternity is but a moment, but a moment that will never end.</FONT></P><B>

                           to him, who is truly God and eternal, Alcazar (p. 176) applies them to God the Father. Others think them to be spoken of God,
                           as the word God agrees to all the three divine persons, who are one and the same God. See Ribera. --- <I>And from the seven
                           spirits.</I> Alcazar understands them of seven of God's attributes, or perfections, but, by the common exposition, are meant
                           seven of the chief created spirits, who in a special manner assist at the throne of God, employed to execute God's commands,
                           as Raphael saith, (Tobit. xii. 15.) <I>I am one of the seven who stand before God.</I> (Witham) --- <I>Spirits,</I> &amp;c.
                           Some understand this of the Holy Ghost, on account of his seven gifts; but the most literal interpretation is of the principal
                           Angels, who always surround the throne of God, and are his ministering spirits. (Calmet) --- <I>And from Jesus Christ,</I>[2]
                           made man, and the Redeemer of mankind, whom St. John here names after the seven spirits, because he continues his discourse
                           about Christ, <I>who is the faithful witness;</I> testified and approved of God by so many miracles, prophecies, &amp;c. He
                           is the chief of the martyrs or witnesses, as the Greek word signifies. --- <I>The first begotten of the dead,</I> both first
                           in dignity, and first that rose to an immortal life. --- <I>The prince of the kings of the earth,</I> whose power is infinitely
                           greater than all theirs; and this to put the suffering Christians in mind, that they needed not to fear the persecuting emperors,
                           who have no power after this life. --- <I>And</I> Christ <I>hath made us a kingdom,</I> inasmuch as by his grace he has made
                           us members of his true Church, called the kingdom of God, and promised us to reign with him in his glorious kingdom in heaven.
                           --- <I>And</I> hath made us <I>priests to God, and his Father,</I> to offer up spiritual sacrifices. See 1 Peter ii. 9. ---
                           <I>To him be,</I> or is due, <I>glory and empire, for ever and ever. Amen</I>. That is, to Jesus Christ. (Witham) </FONT></P><B>

                           the <I>Lord's day</I>. The Church, in the apostle's time, changed the day of rest, on which the Jews were commanded to rest
                           and sanctify that day, from Saturday to Sunday, from the last day of the week to the first. They judged this only to be an
                           indispensable precept, that some day or some time should be appointed, in a special manner, for God's service and worship,
                           on which Christians should also abstain from servile works, that were not of necessity: as to the determination of such a
                           day of the week, they judged that the Church had power to change the day. The late pretended reformers have all agreed with
                           us in this change. And if they would have all that is expressed in this commandment, to be of an indispensable and unchangeable
                           obligation, according to the letter of the law, they ought certainly to observe, to sanctify, and to abstain from all servile
                           works on Saturdays, or on the Jewish sabbath. --- <I>A great voice, as of a trumpet.</I> To signify the importance of things

                           of one crying in the desert, and who in Malachias is called the Angel of the Lord, as he is also styled in the first verse
                           of this chapter. (Pastorini)</FONT></P><B>
