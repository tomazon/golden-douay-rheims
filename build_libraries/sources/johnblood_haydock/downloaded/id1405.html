                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And he feared that he should not have as formerly, enough for charges

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 And he was greatly perplexed in mind, and purposed to go into Persia,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 And he left Lysias, a nobleman of the blood royal, to oversee the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And to bring up his son, Antiochus, till he came again.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 And he delivered to him half the army, and the elephants: and he gave

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And that he should send an army against them, to destroy and root

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And that he should settle strangers to dwell in all their coasts,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 So the king took the half of the army that remained, *and went forth

                                    and went through the higher countries.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 Then Lysias chose Ptolemee, the son of Dorymenus, and Nicanor, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 And he sent with them forty thousand men, and seven thousand horsemen:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 So they went forth with all their power, and came, and pitched near

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 And the merchants of the countries heard the fame of them: and they
                                    took silver and gold in abundance, and servants: and they came into the camp, to buy the children of Israel for slaves: and
                                    there were joined to them the forces of Syria, and of the land of the strangers.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 And Judas, and his brethren, saw that evils were multiplied, and that

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 And they said, every man to his neighbour: Let us raise up the low

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 And the assembly was gathered, that they might be ready for battle:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">45 Now Jerusalem was not inhabited, but was like a desert: there was

                                    there was the habitation of the Gentiles: and joy was taken away from Jacob, and the pipe and harp ceased there.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">46 And they assembled together, and came to Maspha, over-against Jerusalem:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">49 And they brought the priestly ornaments, and the first-fruits and
