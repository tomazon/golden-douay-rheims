                           in Samaria afterwards called Sichem. This king was also a priest of the Most High; i.e. of the true God. He blessed Abraham,
                           after he had defeated Chodorlahomor and the other kings; (Genesis xiv.) and Abraham gave him the tithes of all things which
                           he had taken from his enemies. He is said (ver. 3.) to have been <I>without father, without mother, without any genealogy,</I>
                           without <I>beginning of days</I> or <I>end of life,</I> inasmuch as we have no account in the Scripture of these particulars.
                           He is said in Genesis to have brought out, inasmuch as he was a priest, that is, to have offered up a sacrifice to God of
                           bread and wine. The apostle here shews two things, that Melchisedech was greater than Abraham, and that he is a figure of
                           Christ, <I>who is a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.</I> (Psalm cix. 4.) (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           for Christ himself was not without a Father according to his divinity, nor without a Mother in his humanity; but because his
                           genealogy is not given in Genesis, as that of the other patriarchs is, but he is abruptly introduced without any mention of
                           either his birth or death. In Melchisedech all was prophetical and figurative of Jesus Christ; and Abraham undoubtedly in
                           this patriarch saw Jesus Christ in spirit, and exulted that all the nations of the earth were to be blessed in him. <I>Abraham,</I>

                           <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">Ver. 4.</FONT></B><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif"> <I>Consider
                           how great this man</I> (Melchisedech) <I>was,</I> and greater than our great patriarch, Abraham: <STRONG>1.</STRONG> Because
                           Abraham, of his own accord, paid tithes to this priest of all the chief things he had: which was to own himself inferior to
                           him: as the rest of the Jewish people are inferior to the sons of Levi, the descendants of Aaron, who being raised to the
                           dignity of the priesthood by the command of God, have a right to take tithes or tenths of the people; and so are honoured
                           above the rest. <STRONG>2.</STRONG> This Melchisedech blessed, or gave a benediction to our great father Abraham, to whom
                           the promises of blessing all nations was made. Now he that gives a blessing to another, must be better or greater than he
                           to whom the blessing is given; therefore Melchisedech was greater than Abraham. <STRONG>3.</STRONG> To shew another pre-eminence
                           of the priesthood of Melchisedech (which was a figure of the eternal priesthood of Christ) above the priesthood of Aaron,
                           the apostle takes notice that the sons of Levi, the priests of the ancient law, to whom tithes were to be paid, were no more
                           than mortal men, always dying, whereas the Scripture only witnesseth of Melchisedech that he liveth; he is represented as
                           one that hath neither beginning nor end of his days. This agrees chiefly with Christ, who by the psalmist is called, a priest
                           for ever. And, though Christ also died for us, for it was chiefly by his death that he offered his sacrifice, yet he presently
                           rose again, and continues for ever a priest, without a successor as to his priesthood, and as to the sacrifice of expiation
                           for the sins of mankind. His priesthood, his sacrifice, and oblation for our redemption, lasts for ever. <STRONG>4.</STRONG>
                           Another reason that shews the priesthood of Melchisedech (and of our Saviour, Christ) to be above the Aaronical priesthood,
                           is, that not only Abraham, but even Aaron and Levi, and all their successors, may be said in the person of Abraham to have
                           paid tithes to Melchisedech, because we may consider them as yet in the loins of Abraham, from whom they descended; though
                           it cannot be said, in like manner, that Christ himself was in the loins of Abraham, because though he was Son of Abraham,
                           yet his conception was not in the ordinary way of human generation, but by the operation of the Holy Ghost. See St. Augustine,
                           lib. x. de Gen. ad lit. chap. 20. tom. 3. p. 270. nov. edit. <STRONG>5.</STRONG> St. Paul (ver. 11.) brings another reason
                           to shew that the priesthood according to the order of Melchisedech was more perfect, because true justice and sanctification
                           could not be given either by the priesthood of Aaron or by the law of Moses, which began as it were together; for if the former
                           law and sacrifices offered by the priests of Aaron, had been sufficient for man's justification and salvation, there would
                           have been no necessity of a new priesthood according to the order of Melchisedech. Of this St. Paul speaks elsewhere to the
                           Romans. And, as there is a new priesthood, so there is a new law, by which the former is no longer in force. <STRONG>6.</STRONG>
                           He takes notice of this difference from the former priesthood, that they were priests of the tribe of Levi, but that Christ,
                           the priest according to the order of Melchisedech, is of the tribe of Juda. <STRONG>7.</STRONG> Another difference is, that
                           the former law, and all belonging to it, consisted of <I>carnal</I> precepts, (ver. 16) in outward ceremonies and sacrifices,
                           with promises of temporal blessings and a long life in this world; but the new law and sacrifice of Christ, is <I>according
                           to the power of an indissoluble</I> and never-ending <I>life,</I> conferring inward graces, with the remission of sins, by
                           which men are justified and saved, with promises of eternal happiness. <STRONG>8.</STRONG> He tells us that Christ's priesthood
                           was confirmed by God himself with an oath: not so the priesthood of Aaron. This second testament therefore is much better,
                           and more excellent. <STRONG>9.</STRONG> The former testament <I>brought nothing to perfection.</I> (ver. 19.) It had nothing
                           but types and figures of what was to be fulfilled under the priesthood of Christ. The priests died, and succeeded one to another;
                           and there was need of different sacrifices, which they were to offer daily for their own sins and for the sins of the people;
                           but Christ was <I>innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners,</I> (ver. 26) could not sin, but by suffering once has redeemed
                           all, has satisfied for the sins of all mankind, and by this one sacrifice can save all that come to him by faith, hope, and
                           love; he lives for ever to make intercession for us, as our Mediator and Redeemer. As he remains for ever, he is a priest
                           for ever; and by virtue of that one sacrifice on the cross, all that believe in him and obey him may be may be saved, and
                           be happy for eternity. Christ's sacrifice and oblation on the cross, is that one sacrifice of the new law which remains and
                           will be continued by his ministers, the priest of the new law, to the end of the world, the manner only being different, but
                           not the sacrifice. This is the doctrine of the Catholic Church, delivered to the faithful in the Council of Trent,[1] (session
                           22. cap. 2.) where it is declared, that in the Mass is continued the same sacrifice and oblation which Christ offered, who
                           is still the chief priest, in whose name only his ministers, the bishops and priests, speak and act as his instruments. The
                           Victim that is offered is also the same, to wit, the body and blood of Christ, after a spiritual and unbloody manner, according
                           to his command at his last supper. The oblation at the Mass is indeed a true and proper sacrifice, yet not a new or different
                           sacrifice of expiation for the sins of mankind, but an application of Christ's satisfactions and merits, which, though of
                           infinite value, and more than sufficient to satisfy for the sins of the whole world, yet by the will of God are to be applied
                           to us by faith, by the sacraments, by the same sacrifice of Christ's body and blood, offered at the mass, &amp;c. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           successor; but liveth and concurreth for ever with his ministers, the priests of the New Testament, in all their functions.
                           Secondly, that no one priest of the law, not all of them together, could offer that absolute sacrifice of everlasting redemption,
                           which our one high priest, Jesus Christ, has offered once and for ever. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           Christ offered himself but once in a <I>bloody</I> manner on the cross; but, besides this bloody offering, he still continues
                           to offer himself in an <I>unbloody</I> manner. This he does both in heaven and upon earth; in heaven, by presenting his sacred
                           humanity continually to his Father; and on earth, by daily offering himself, under the appearances of bread and wine, on our
                           altars. Hence this eucharistic sacrifice is both a commemoration and continuation of the sacrifice of the cross. To understand
                           this, it must be observed, that the essence of a sacrifice includes several actions, the principal of which are the immolation
                           of the victim, and the <I>oblation</I> of the victim when immolated. Now the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross, ended
                           only as to the <I>bloody</I> immolation; the same victim is still immolated mystically, by the separate consecration of the
                           bread and wine, and continues as the oblation. Jesus Christ, in quality of the eternal high priest, has carried his victim,
                           i.e. his body, into heaven, and there offers it continually to his Father. He continues also his sacrifice here on earth,
                           by the ministry of his priests: who to the end of time will offer to God the same immolated victim, present on our altars
                           under the appearance of bread and wine---a sacrifice infinitely perfect, since a God is the priest, and a God the victim.
                           The chief-priest who offers it is a God-man; the victim offered is a Man-God: a God the victim, offered by a God the priest!
                           Behold a sacrifice truly worthy of God---a sacrifice capable of atoning not only for our sins, but for the sins of ten thousand
                           worlds. What confidence then ought Christians to have in such a sacrifice! How solicitous ought they to be to assist daily
                           at these awful, or, to use St. Chrysostom's expression, these tremendous mysteries! Let us now examine the sentiments of learned
                           Protestant divines: "It is certain," says Dr. Grabe, "that Irenæus and all the Fathers, either contemporary with the apostles,
                           or their immediate successors, whose writings are still extant, considered the blessed Eucharist to be the sacrifice of the
                           new law, and offered bread and wine on the altar, as sacred oblations to God the Father; and that this was not the private
                           opinion of any particular Church or teacher, but the public doctrine and practice of the universal Church, which she received
                           from the apostles, and they from Christ, is expressly shewn by Irenæus, and before him by Justin Martyr and Clement of Rome."
                           (Nota in Irenæum. p. 323.) --- "The elements being really changed from ordinary bread and wine into the body and blood of
                           Christ, mystically present, as in a sacrament, and that by virtue of the consecration, not by the faith of him that receives,
                           I am to admit and maintain whatsoever appears duly consonant with this truth, viz. that the elements so consecrated are truly
                           the sacrifice of Christ upon the cross, inasmuch as the body and blood of Christ are contained in them. ... And the sacrifice
                           of the cross being necessarily propitiatory, and impetratory both, it cannot be denied that the sacrament of the Eucharist,
                           inasmuch as it is the same sacrifice with that upon the cross, is also both propitiatory and impetratory." (Thorndike Epil.
                           p. 44 and 46.) --- "The holy Fathers frequently say, that in the Eucharist is offered and sacrificed the very body of Christ,
                           as is evident in almost innumerable places." (Bp. Forbes' de Euch. lib. iii. chap. 2. sect. 10.) --- "The sacrifice of the
                           supper is not only propitiatory, and may be offered up for the remission of our daily sins, but likewise is impetratory, and
                           may be rightly offered for the obtaining all blessings. Although the Scripture does not plainly and in express words teach
                           this, yet the holy Fathers with universal consent have thus understood the Scripture, as has been demonstrated by many; and
                           all the ancient liturgies prescribe, that in time of the oblation, prayers be offered for peace, &amp;c. as is evident to
                           all." (Bp. Forbes' de Euch. lib. iii. chap. 2. sect. 12.) --- "The Church, commemorating the sacrifice of Christ with the
                           usual rites and words, in this also sacrificeth and offereth that which is her own, given to her by Christ; that she placeth
                           before the eyes of God; by that she beseecheth God; and it is the same sacrifice that Christ offered; the same one, true,
                           and singular sacrifice, as St. Augustine calls it; a sacrifice of memory according to Eusebius; a spiritual sacrifice, according
                           to others. After that the faithful offer themselves according to the example of Christ, &amp;c. In all this what is there
                           new, what deformed, what hurtful? But minds once distracted, distract all things into a depraved meaning, and then are glad
                           to find a hint for it in any of the schools." (Grotius of Christian sacrifice.) --- To these we may add the authority of Ed.
                           Burke, in his speech to the electors of Bristol: "The mass is church service in the Latin tongue, not exactly like our liturgy,
                           but very near, and contains no offence whatever against the laws of good morals." (p. 29.)</FONT></P>
