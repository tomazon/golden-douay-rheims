                           by the Lord to speak what was contrary to his temporal interest. After complying reluctantly, God ceased to strive, as it
                           were, with his rebellious will any longer, and left him to follow the bent of his corrupt heart. Upon which he proceeded to
                           give that infernal counsel which involved many of the Israelites and himself in utter destruction. (Haydock) (Chap. xxxi.

                           The great personage whom I have in view, whose coming is deferred yet for many ages. (Haydock) --- The whole prediction refers
                           to the Messias, whom Balaam beheld by the eyes of his posterity, the wise men, (Calmet) or in the prophetic vision. (Menochius)
                           --- Some modern Rabbins pretend that he speaks of David, who was indeed a figure of Christ, (Calmet) and defeated the Moabites,
                           2 Kings v. 8. But the prophecy was perfectly fulfilled only in our Saviour's person, who is called the bright and morning
                           star, (Apocalypse xxii. 16,) to whom all nations were given for an inheritance, Psalm ii., and Acts i. 8. (Worthington) ---
                           Hebrew also, "I see this <I>thy ruin,</I> but," &amp;c. Septuagint, "I will shew to him, yet not now; I will make him happy,
                           (Calmet); but (makarizo, I bless) it, <I>or</I> he does not approach." God executed what he ever promised in favour of all
                           Israel, when he sent them his beloved Son. --- <I>A Star.</I> Christ, the light of the world, the splendour of his Father's
                           glory, whose birth was made known in the East, by a star, or meteor of unusual brightness. (Haydock) --- This material star
                           is not the primary object of the prediction, since it did not rise <I>out of Jacob,</I> but it pointed out the <I>orient from
                           on high,</I> and then disappeared. The ancient Jews understood this passage of the Messias. (Onkelos, &amp;c.) Hence the impostor,
                           Ben. Cusiba, took advantage of this general opinion, to draw the people after him, as the person designated; when he assumed
                           the title of Bar-chocheba, "the son of the star," in the second age [century] of the church. --- <I>Of Seth.</I> Though David,
                           as the figure of the Messias, conquered the Moabites, he cannot be said to have subdued all nations, the descendants of Seth,
                           by Noe, nor all the just of whom Seth was the father, in opposition to the children of Cain. But Christ will subject all the
                           <I>just</I> to his empire, and will judge <I>all mankind.</I> Some, nevertheless, take the children of Seth to be the Moabites,
                           who had been already mentioned; and Junius translates the Hebrew with allusion to the shameful origin of that people. The
                           Samaritan may also signify, if we substitute <I>d</I> for <I>r</I> in <I>korkor,</I> as Jeremias also reads (chap. xlviii.
                           45,) <I>kodkod.</I> "He shall penetrate the ends of Moab, and shall overturn the walls of the children of elevation, <I>or</I>
                           of pride." There were many hills in the country of the Moabites, and the people were noted for haughtiness, Jeremias xlviii.
                           28, 29, 45. (Calmet) --- Some also assert, that Seth was the name of a king, (Grotius) and of a town of Moab. (Rabbi Nathan)
                           --- But of this there is no proof. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           scandalous, to be his intimate friends. (Haydock) --- He will save those who abandoned paganism, which had fixed its seat
                           at the great <I>city</I> of Rome, (Calmet) and he will raise up Constantine (Menochius; Tirinus) to <I>rule</I> over <I>Jacob,</I>
                           his people. At his second coming, he will exterminate all who shall have refused to acknowledge his sovereignty, and who have
                           remained out of the <I>city</I> of his Church. (Haydock) --- Those who have fled out of the cities for safety, shall be sought
                           out by David, and destroyed. He slew all the male children of Edom, 3 Kings xv. 15. (Calmet) --- In this prophecy, some particulars
                           relate to him, as that he shall subject Moab and Idumea by the valour of his troops, while other things can belong only to
                           Christ, the star, who shall destroy the remains of the city. (Menochius) --- By changing one letter, Calmet would translate,
                           "Princes shall spring from Jacob: but Seir shall perish from his cities." A long train of princes in Jacob prefigured the
                           Messias, while the Idumeans have been unknown for many ages. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           and Calmet doubts not but this is the import of the present text. The Macedonians, under Alexander and his successors, conquered
                           the countries of Assyria, Palestine, &amp;c. Antiochus Epiphanes raised a cruel persecution against the Jews. But many suppose
                           that the <I>Hebrews</I> here mentioned, are the nations beyond the Euphrates. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "ships....shall afflict
                           Heber, and he also shall perish for ever," which seems to refer to Heber alone, and not to those who shall oppress them, as
                           the Vulgate, Septuagint, &amp;c., express it. (Haydock) --- Indeed, we do not find that the Scripture mentions the end of
                           the Roman empire, of which many explain this passage. (Calmet) --- Grotius (Jur. ii. 9) maintained that it still subsisted
                           in the German empire. Others think it will be destroyed only in the days of Antichrist. (Tirinus) (Daniel ii. 40.) --- But
                           many have asserted that it was overturned by the Goths, and that the Romans are the people who would reduce the Hebrews to
                           the greatest misery, under Titus. (Menochius) --- The kings of <I>Macedon</I> are, however, styled kings of <I>Cethim,</I>
                           (1 Machabees i. 1., viii. 5) and they were the immediate subverters of the Persian empire, as theirs fell a prey to the Romans.
