                           into this alliance before the civil war broke out, that Isboseth, who had fixed his court at Mahanaim, might have an opponent
                           near at hand. The fruits of this marriage were very unfortunate, and brought great distress upon David: so little do men know

                           was slain by Solomon, (3 Kings ii. 24.; Menochius) for arrogating to himself the right of the first-born, and pretending that

                           She was otherwise of no nobility, but perhaps loved by David more than the rest, as Rachel was by Jacob. The Rabbins would
                           infer that Egla and Michol are the same person. But the latter had no children, (chap. vi. 23.; Salien) and is mentioned [in]

                           To marry the king's widow was deemed an attempt upon the throne, 3 Kings ii. 22. Hence Solomon was so displeased at Adonias,
                           ver. 24. Some think that Isboseth formed the accusation on mere conjecture; but Abner does not deny the fact. (Calmet) ---

                           the dog as one of the vilest of animals, chap. ix. 8., and Job xxx. 1. --- <I>Juda.</I> This word is neglected by the Septuagint.
                           Some would substitute <I>Liduth,</I> "to be cast away." (Calmet) --- God permits the defenders of a wrong cause to fall out,

                           It seems therefore that he knew of God's appointment, and had hitherto resisted it for his own temporal convenience. (Haydock)
                           --- If both he and Isboseth were ignorant of this decree, Abner had no right to deprive the latter of the crown. (Abulensis,

                           And no wonder; since even David could not repress the insolence of his chief commander, ver. 39. So Otho "had not yet sufficient

                           Could David thus authorize treachery? It is answered, that Abner knew that the throne belonged to him, and he was already
                           responsible for all the evils of the civil war. David does not approve of his conduct, but only makes use of him to obtain
                           his right. --- <I>Michol.</I> He might justly think that the people would have less repugnance to acknowledge him for their
                           sovereign, when they saw that he had married the daughter of Saul. She had never been repudiated by him. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Thus he would screen the perfidy of Abner, (Menochius) and hinder him from using any violence. (Calmet) --- The pacific king
                           accedes immediately to the request, as he had no personal aversion to David, and saw that he was in a far more elevated condition
                           than Phaltiel. (Haydock) --- Moreover, this was no time to irritate him more, as Abner was discontented. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And when David heard of it, after the thing was now done, he said:
