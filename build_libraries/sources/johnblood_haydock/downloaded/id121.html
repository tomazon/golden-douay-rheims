                           the Grecians against the Hebrews.</I>[1] By the Grecians are many times understood the heathens or pagans, as Acts xiv. 1,
                           xviii. 4., &amp;c., but here by Grecians (which some translate <I>Hellenists</I> or <I>Grecists</I>) we may understand those
                           new converted Christians, who had been Jews before, but who had been born in places where the Greek tongue was spoken; as
                           by the Hebrews, we may understand those converted to the Christian faith, who were of the Jewish race, born, and bred in those
                           places, where they spoke not Greek, but Syriac, which was then the language of the Jews. This difference is grounded on the
                           Greek text. --- <I>Their widows were neglected;</I> that is, they seemed less regarded, or less favoured in the daily distributions,
                           than such as were of the Jewish race, and spoke the language of the Jews, as it was then spoken in Palestine. (Witham) ---
                           They were most probably both of Jewish origin, and received their different appellations according to the language they spoke.
                           The former were also frequently called Hellenists. (Calmet) --- It is not certain in what the Greek widows were despised.
                           Some imagine, that a preference was given to their rivals, in the distribution of offices, that they were appointed to the
                           meaner charges, and oppressed with too much labour. But it is most natural to suppose, that the complaints regarded the alms
                           that were distributed, and that the necessities of both parties were not supplied, without the appearance of partiality. (Menochius)
                           --- For chap. iv. we read <I>neither was there any one among them that wanted; and distribution was made to every man, according
                           as he had need; and the multitude of believers had but one heart and one soul.</I> But nothing in human institutions is so
                           good, as not to require occasional reform, owing either to the wickedness or negligence of man. (Estius, in different location)</FONT></P><B>

                           serve tables.</I> The apostles did not judge it proper for them to be so much employed in managing that common stock, out
                           of which every one, as they stood in need, were supplied, as to meat, and all other necessities: this took up too much of
                           their time, which might be better employed in preaching, &amp;c. (Witham) --- <I>Word of God.</I> The most essential duty
                           of an apostle and bishop, is to announce the word of God. St. Paul would not even baptize, lest it should be a prejudice to
                           the performance of this great duty, for which he had been sent. Many think, that this ministry of the tables, here signifies,
                           not only the distribution of corporal nourishment, but the dispensing of the holy Eucharist. As sacred and divine as was this
                           latter duty, the apostles preferred before it, their obligation of preaching. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           ye out among you seven men,</I> and men of a good repute and character, <I>full of the Holy Ghost.</I> (Witham) --- Diverse
                           circumstances prove, that they were chosen to be about the altar also. They were to be full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom:
                           they received the imposition of the apostles' hands, and in them St. Paul requireth, in a manner, the same conditions as in
                           bishops; all which would not have been necessary for any secular stewardship. See Acts xiii. 3. Immediately after their ordination,
                           they preached, baptized, disputed, as we see in St. Stephen, &amp;c. &amp;c. Hence St. Ignatius: "it is ours to please by
                           all means the deacons, who are for the ministry of Jesus Christ; for they are not servitors of meat and drink, but ministers
                           of the Church of God. For what are deacons but imitators or followers of Christ, ministering to bishops, as Christ to his
                           Father, and working unto him a clean and immaculate work, even as St. Stephen to St. James? (Ep. ad Tral.)</FONT></P><B>

                           names of these seven, it would appear, that they were all Greeks. The reason of this, most probably, is to silence more effectually
                           all future murmurs, by giving to the aggrieved party protectors of their own nation. (Tirinus) --- The history of Stephen
                           occurs hereafter. Philip, in the 8th chapter, is called an evangelist, that is, a preacher of the gospel. By Eusebius, Tertullian,
                           and others, he is called an apostle, that is, an apostolic man. See Lives of the Saints, and Roman Martyrology, June 6. ---
                           St. Jerome says, his [Philip's] tomb, and that of his four daughters, the prophetesses, were to be seen at Cæsarea, in Palestine.
                           (Ep. ad Eustoch.) --- Of the rest, except Nicolas, nothing certain is known: their acts have perished. Nicolas, as appears
                           from the text, was a proselyte, first to Judaism, then to Christianity. St. Epiphanius, and many others, accuse him of being,
                           by his incontinency, the author, or at least the occasion of the impure sects of Nicoalites and Gnostics. Clement of Alexandria,
                           and St. Augustine, acquit him of this, and attribute the above heresies to an abuse of some expressions, which he uttered
                           in his simplicity, and which were susceptible of a good and bad sense. See Baronius and Tillemont.</FONT></P><B>

                           they,</I> that is, the apostles, <I>laid,</I> or <I>imposed hands upon them.</I> These deacons, therefore, were designed and
                           ordained for a sacred ministry, and not only to manage the common stock, and temporals of the faithful. This is proved, 1.
                           By the qualifications required in such men, who were to be <I>full of the Holy Ghost.</I> 2. This is evident from their ecclesiastical
                           functions mentioned in this book of the Acts, and in the epistles of St. Paul, and by the ancient Fathers. St. Stephen and
                           St. Philip immediately preached the gospel, as we find in this, and the 8th chapter; they baptized those that were converted.
                           In the first ages they assisted the bishops and priests at their divine office, and distributed the sacred chalice, or cup
                           of the holy Eucharist. They succeeded as it were, the Levites of the old law. And in the chief Churches, the deacons, or the
                           archdeacons in the first ages, had the chief administration of the ecclesiastical revenues, as we read of St. Laurence, at
                           Rome. (Witham) --- <I>Imposed hands upon them.</I> Notwithstanding the opinions of some, that these deacons were only the
                           dispensers of corporal food, and therefore very different from the ministers of the altar, who now bear that name, it must
                           nevertheless be observed, that the most ancient Fathers, Sts. Justin, Irenæus, &amp;c., have acknowledged in them the two-fold
                           character, and always style them the ministers of the mysteries of God. At the commencement of Christianity, the faithful
                           generally received the holy Eucharist after a repast, which they took together, in imitation of our Saviour, who instituted
                           the Sacrament after supper. Now the deacons, who presided over the first tables, after having distributed the corporeal food
                           to the assembly, ministered also the food of life, which they received from the hand of the bishop. Thus were they ministers
                           of both the common and sacred tables. Afterwards, they had assistants called sub-deacons, and as among the Gentile converts,
                           there did not exist that community of goods, as at Jerusalem, their chief employment became to serve the bishop in the oblation
                           of the holy sacrifice. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           is not recorded to have happened to any other but Moses, and our Lord at his transfiguration. (Denis the Carthusian) --- Although
                           this appearance, in an inferior degree, has been not unfrequently observed in the constant and cheerful countenance of the

                           with heaven.</FONT></P>
