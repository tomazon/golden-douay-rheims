                           <i>Aman</i> means, "a disturber." (Haydock) --- <i>Who.</i> Septuagint add, "Bougaios, or Gogaios." Gog designates Scythia,
                           where Aman might have been born. Pliny ([Natural History?] iv. 12.) places there the lake and river Ruges. But the Bugean,
                           in Greek, may mean, "greatly puffed up:" or it may stand for Bagoas, "an eunuch," (Judith xii. 11.) like Putiphar. --- <i>Agag,</i>
                           the king of Amalec, 1 Kings xv. This title, like that of Macedonian, (chap. xvi. 10.) is probably used out of contempt, as
                           the Jews fequently styled their enemies, "race of Chanaan," Ezechiel xvi. 3., and Daniel xiii. 56. (Calmet) --- Sulpitius
                           takes Aman to have been a Persian. His Amalecite ancestors may have fled before Saul into Macedonia, though he himself resided
                           in Persia, so as to belong to all those nations. (Tirinus) (Menochius) --- <i>Throne.</i> Thus were Joseph and Joakim exalted,
                           Genesis xli. 40., and 4 Kings xxv. 28. (Calmet) --- The Persians gave places according to merit, (Haydock) or as a reward.

                           the latter at least exacted this respect from their subjects. But the pious Jews avoided appearing at such times, or the kings
                           dispensed with them. The mere bending the knee, out of civil respect, would not have been objected to; and Mardochai says,
                           he would not have refused to kiss the footsteps of Aman, chap. xiii. 12. (Calmet) (St. Thomas Aquinas, 2. 2. q. 84.) (Tirinus)

                           <i>Lot.</i> The Persians were much addicted to divination. The superstitious Aman, though he would appear a deity, was to
                           be regulated by lots! Providence caused almost a whole year to intervene, before the cruel execution was to commence. (Calmet)
                           --- Reason began to shew the futility of divination, (Cicero) but the Christian religion alone has been able to counteract
                           its baneful influence. (Calmet) --- India is still much infected with it. (Bernier.) --- <i>Phur.</i> Hebrew, "they cast Pur,
                           that <i>is</i> the lot, before Aman." (Haydock) --- The explanation intimates that Pur is a Persian word. (Du Hamel) --- Yet
                           Pagnin maintains that it means in Hebrew, "to crush," a wine-press, or vessel; and the lot, which is thrown therein. (Menochius)
                           --- Tickets, with the names of the twelve months, were probably drawn; and after the month was thus determined, Aman put in
                           the urn as many tickets as it had days, and was directed to pitch upon the 13th. Septuagint have the 14th, both here and ver.
                           13. (Calmet) --- How preposterous was the (Haydock) fury of this man, thus to decide upon the day before he had the king's
                           leave! (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           is not for the king's profit to tolerate them." (Haydock) --- These are the old calumnies repeated by Tacitus, (Hist. v.)
                           and ably refuted by Josephus. (contra Apion) Almost all Israel still continued about Media. Few had taken advantage of the

                           for an individual; (Calmet) though Aman might expect to raise it by the confiscation of the Jews' effects, ver. 13. Some think
                           he speaks of the Babylonian talent, on which supposition the sum would amount to twenty-one millions of French livres, (Bude.;
                           Calmet) or of the Attic one, which is worth half the Hebrew talent. The king might thus be prevented from thinking that the

                                    said to him: Why dost thou alone not observe the king's commandment?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 And when they were saying this often, and he would not hearken to them;
                                    they told Aman, desirous to know whether he would continue in his resolution: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 Now when Aman had heard this, and had proved by experience that Mardochai

                                    he had heard that he was of the nation of the Jews, and he chose rather to destroy all the nation of the Jews that were in
                                    the kingdom of Assuerus.</font></p>

                                    the nation of the Jews should be destroyed: and there came out the twelfth month, which is called Adar.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people scattered through
                                    all the provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws and ceremonies, and moreover despise the
                                    king's ordinances: and thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by impunity.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And he said to him: As to the money which thou promisest, keep it

                                    the thirteenth day of the same month: and they wrote, as Aman had commanded, to all the king's lieutenants, and to the judges
                                    of the provinces, and of divers nations, as every nation could read, and hear, according to their different languages, in
                                    the name of king Assuerus: and the letters, sealed with his ring,</font></p>

                                    all the Jews, both young and old, little children, and women, in one day, that is, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month,
                                    which is called Adar, and to make a spoil of their goods.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And the contents of the letters were to this effect, that all provinces

                                    And, immediately, the edict was hung up in Susan, the king and Aman feasting together, and all the Jews, that were in the
