                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And we shall come upon him in what place soever he shall be found:

                                    was defeated, that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And Chusai said to Sadoc, and Abiathar, the priests: Thus and thus

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying: Tarry not this

                                    is with him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And Jonathan and Achimaas stayed by the fountain Rogel: and there
                                    went a maid and told them: and they went forward, to carry the message to king David, for they might not be seen, nor enter
                                    into the city.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 But a certain boy saw them, and told Absalom: but they making haste,
                                    went into the house of a certain man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court, and they went down into it.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And the woman took, and spread a covering over the mouth of the well,
                                    as it were to dry sodden barley: and so the thing was not known.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And when Absalom's servants were come into the house, they said to
                                    the woman: Where is Achimaas, and Jonathan? and the woman answered them: They passed on in haste, after they had tasted a
                                    little water. But they that sought them, when they found them not, returned into Jerusalem.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And when they were gone, they came up out of the well, and going on,
                                    told king David, and said: Arise, and pass quickly over the river: for this manner of counsel has Achitophel given against
                                    you.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 So David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 But Achitophel, seeing that his counsel was not followed, saddled
                                    his ass, and arose, and went home to his house and to his city: and putting his house in order, hanged himself, and was buried
                                    in the sepulchre of his father.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 Now Absalom appointed Amasa in Joab's stead, over the army: and Amasa
