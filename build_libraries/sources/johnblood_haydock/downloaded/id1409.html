                           <i>Rome.</i> He had been a hostage instead of Epiphanes, who usurped his throne, chap. i. 11. After the death of the latter,
                           the senate sent three legates to administer the kingdom, during the minority of Eupator. One of them was slain. The king and
                           Lysias sent to exculpate themselves, but received no satisfactory answer. Demetrius thought this a proper opportunity for
                           regaining the throne. He consulted the historian, Polybius, who advised him to depart privately. He, however, addressed the
                           senate for leave, and being refused, fled with eight attendants to Tripoli, and thence to Apamea. His rivals durst not attack
                           him, as he pretended to be sent by the Romans. The army of Eupator seized their king and Lysias, and put them to death. (Polybius
                           cxiv., and cxxii.; Josephus; Calmet) --- Seleucus and Epiphanes were brothers; and of course Demetrius was cousin to Eupator,
                           (Worthington) and the lawful heir of Seleucus. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">1 In* the hundred and fifty-first year, Demetrius, the son of Seleucus,
                                    departed from the city of Rome, and came up with&nbsp;few men into a city of the sea coast, and reigned there.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 And it came to pass, as he entered into the house of the kingdom of
                                    his fathers, that the army seized upon Antiochus, and Lysias, to bring them unto him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 And when he knew it, he said: Let me not see their face.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 So the army slew them. And Demetrius sat upon the throne of his kingdom:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And there came to him the wicked and ungodly men of Israel: and Alcimus
                                    was at the head of them, who desired to be made high priest.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And they accused the people to the king, saying: Judas and his brethren
                                    have destroyed all thy friends, and he hath driven us out of our land.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 Now, therefore, send some man whom thou trustest, and let him go, and
                                    see all the havock he hath made amongst us, and in the king's lands: and let him punish all his friends and their helpers.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 Then the king chose Bacchides, one of his friends, that ruled beyond
                                    the great river in the kingdom, and was faithful to the king: and he sent him,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 To see the havoc that Judas had made: and the wicked Alcimus he made
                                    high priest, and commanded him to take revenge upon the children of Israel.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And they arose, and came with a great army into the land of Juda:
                                    and they sent messengers, and spoke to Judas and his brethren with peaceable words, deceitfully.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 But they gave no heed to their words: for they saw that they were

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 Then there assembled to Alcimus and Bacchides a company of the scribes,
                                    to require things that are just:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And first the Assideans, that were among the children of Israel, and
                                    they sought peace of them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 For they said: One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron is come,
                                    he will not deceive us.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And he spoke to them peaceably: and he swore to them, saying: We will
                                    do you no harm, nor your friends. </font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And they believed him. And he took threescore of them, and slew them
                                    in one day, according to the word that is written:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 *The flesh of thy saints, and the blood of them they have shed round
                                    about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Then fear and trembling fell upon all the people: for they said: There
                                    is no truth, nor justice among them: for they have broken the covenant, and the oath which they made.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And Bacchides removed the camp from Jerusalem, and pitched in Bethzecha:
                                    and he sent, and took many of them that were fled away from him, and some of the people he killed, and threw them into a great
                                    pit.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 Then he committed the country to Alcimus, and left with him troops
                                    to help him. So Bacchides went away to the king.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 But Alcimus did what he could to maintain his chief priesthood.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And they that disturbed the people resorted to him, and they got the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And Judas saw all the evils that Alcimus, and they that were with
                                    him, did to the children of Israel, much more than the Gentiles.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And he went out into all the coasts of Judea round about, and took
                                    vengeance upon the men that had revolted, and they ceased to go forth any more into the country.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And Alcimus saw that Judas and they that were with him, prevailed:
                                    and he knew that he could not stand against them, and he went back to the king, and accused them of many crimes.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 *And the king sent Nicanor, one of his principal lords, who was a

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 Saying: Let there be no fighting between me and you: I will come with

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And he came to Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably: and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And the thing was known to Judas that he was come to him with deceit:
                                    and he was much afraid of him, and would not see his face any more.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 And Nicanor knew that his counsel was discovered: and he went out

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 And there fell of Nicanor's army almost five thousand men, and they

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And after this Nicanor went up into Mount Sion: and some of the priests
                                    and the people came out to salute him peaceably, and to shew him the holocausts that were offered for the king.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 But he mocked them and despised them, and abused them: and he spoke

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And swore in anger, saying: Unless Judas and his army be delivered
                                    into my hands, as soon as ever I return in peace, I will burn this house. And he went out in a great rage.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And the priests went in, and stood before the face of the altar and
                                    the temple: and weeping, they said:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 Thou, O Lord, hast chosen this house for thy name to be called upon
                                    therein, that it might be a house of prayer and supplication for thy people.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 Be avenged of this man, and his army, and let them fall by the sword:
                                    remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue any longer.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 Then Nicanor went out from Jerusalem, and encamped near to Bethoron:
                                    and an army of Syria joined him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 But Judas pitched in Adarsa with three thousand men: and Judas prayed,
                                    and said:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 *O Lord, when they that were sent by king Sennacherib blasphemed thee,
                                    an angel went out, and slew of them a hundred and eighty-five thousand:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 Even so destroy this army in our sight to-day, and let the rest know
                                    that he hath spoken ill against thy sanctuary: and judge thou him according to his wickedness.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 And the armies joined battle on the thirteenth day of the month, Adar:
                                    and the army of Nicanor was defeated, and he himself was first slain in the battle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 And when his army saw that Nicanor was slain, they threw away their
                                    weapons, and fled:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">45 And they pursued after them one day's journey from Adazer, even till

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">46 And they went forth out of all the towns of Judea round about, and
                                    they pushed them with the horns, and they turned again to them, and they were all slain with the sword, and there was not

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">47 And they took the spoils of them for a booty, and they cut off Nicanor's
