                           of the Church, convinced St. Paul of the great importance of opposing the profane novelties of heretics. It is for this that
                           he insists so much on this subject, as well in this as in his first epistle to Timothy. The ancients expressly tell us, that
                           Simon the magician did not believe in the resurrection of the body, but only that of the soul; meaning its resurrection from
                           sin to grace. (Epiphanius)</FONT></P><B>

                           in the Church there are none but precious <I>vessels of gold and of silver,</I> yet this is only true of the perfect part
                           of the Church, as it comprehends the elect only. The common exposition, by the <I>great house,</I> understands the Catholic
                           Church of Christ here upon earth, in which are mixed both vessels of gold and of earth, both good and bad; both the faithful
                           that will be saved, and others that will be lost by not persevering in the faith and grace of Christ. Every one's endeavour
                           must be to <I>cleanse himself from these,</I> to depart from the ways of iniquity, by the assistances of those graces which
                           God offers him, that so he may be <I>a vessel unto honour,</I> not troubling himself about the mysteries and secrets of predestination,
                           but believing and knowing for certain, that if he be not wanting on his part, he can never be lost: and therefore let him
                           follow the admonition of St. Peter, 2 Peter i. 10. "Wherefore, brethren, labour the more, that by good works you may make
                           sure your vocation and election: for doing these things, you shall not sin at any time." (Witham)</FONT></P><B>
