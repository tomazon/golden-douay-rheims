                           It is wonderful that a prince of so great piety, should be on terms of such strict friendship with a most wicked king. God
                           did not approve of it; and the event was unfortunate, 2 Paralipomenon xx. 37. Achab received the king of Juda with extraordinary
                           magnificence, 2 Paralipomenon xviii. 2. It is thought that (Calmet) the latter had married his daughter, (Grotius) or rather

                           effect of his ill-will. Hence he explains his vision more at large. God often conforms to our ideas, and even prejudices.
                           The people were then accustomed to look upon him as a king, environed with his army of good and evil spirits; the one at his

                           the like manner. We know that God stands in need of no counsellors; (Romans xi. 34.) and that the angels of satan have no

                           Josephus says he had told the king, that if his hand did not wither, like that of Jeroboam, he might conclude that Micheas
                           was a false prophet; particularly as his prediction was at variance with that of Elias; who had asserted that Achab should
                           die at Jezrahel, while Micheas seemed to condemn him to death at Ramoth. But these circumstances are by no means certain,
                           though they be adopted by the author of the Scholastic History, by Lyranus, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- If Sedecias had the assurance
                           to make such a declaration, God was not obliged to work a miracle to prevent the king's mistake; and Micheas had never said
                           that Achab should die at Ramoth. (Haydock) --- <I>Hath.</I> In 2 Paralipomenon xviii. 23, it is expressed, <I>Which way went
                           the spirit of the Lord from me to speak to thee?</I> If he could have proved that he had ever possessed the spirit, he might
                           have spoken with some confidence; though sin may easily banish him. Thus Catholics may ask the pretended reformers, who boast
                           of the spirit, how He came to abandon the Church with which all agree He once resided, to establish a contrary one? The spirit
                           of God cannot be at variance with himself, nor reveal contradictory things. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                                    <p>2 And *in the third year, Josaphat, king of Juda, came down to the king of Israel.</p>

                                    <p>4 And he said to Josaphat: Wilt thou come with me to battle to Ramoth-Galaad?</p>
                                    <p>5 And Josaphat said to the king of Israel: As I am, so art thou: my people and thy people are one: and my horsemen <i>are</i>
                                    thy horsemen. And Josaphat said to the king of Israel: Inquire, I beseech thee, this day the word of the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>6 Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and he said to them: Shall I go to Ramoth-Galaad
                                    to fight, or shall I forbear? They answered: Go up, and the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.</p>
                                    <p>7 And Josaphat said: Is there not here some prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire by him?</p>
                                    <p>8 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: There is one man left, by whom we may inquire of the Lord; Micheas, the son
                                    of Jemla: but I hate him, for he doth not prophesy good to me, but evil. And Josaphat said: Speak not so, O king.</p>
                                    <p>9 Then the king of Israel called an eunuch, and said to him: Make haste, and bring hither Micheas, the son of Jemla.</p>
                                    <p>10 Then the king of Israel, and Josaphat, king of Juda, sat each on his throne, clothed with royal robes, in a court, by
                                    the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets prophesied before them.</p>
                                    <p>11 And Sedecias, the son of Chanaana, made himself horns of iron, and said: Thus saith the Lord: With these shalt thou
                                    push Syria, till thou destroy it.</p>
                                    <p>12 And all the prophets prophesied in like manner, saying: Go up to Ramoth-Galaad, and prosper, for the Lord will deliver
                                    it into the king's hands.</p>
                                    <p>13 And the messenger that went to call Micheas, spoke to him, saying: Behold the words of the prophets with one month declare
                                    good things to the king: let thy word, therefore, be like to theirs, and speak that which is good.</p>
                                    <p>14 But Micheas said to him: As the Lord liveth, whatsoever the Lord shall say to me, that will I speak.</p>
                                    <p>15 So he came to the king, and the king said to him: Micheas, shall we go to Ramoth-Galaad to battle, or shall we forbear?
                                    He answered him: Go up, and prosper, and the Lord shall deliver it into the king's hands.</p>
                                    <p>16 But the king said to him: I adjure thee again and again, that thou tell me nothing but that which is true, in the name
                                    of the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>17 And he said: I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, like sheep that have no shepherd; *and the Lord said: These
                                    have no master: let every man of them return to his house in peace.</p>
                                    <p>18 (Then the king of Israel said to Josaphat: Did I not tell thee, that he prophesieth no good to me, but always evil?)</p>
                                    <p>19 And he added and said: Hear thou, therefore, the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the
                                    army of heaven standing by him on the right hand and on the left:</p>
                                    <p>20 And the Lord said: Who shall deceive Achab, king of Israel, that he may go up, and fall at Ramoth-Galaad? And one spoke
                                    words of this manner, and another otherwise.</p>
                                    <p>21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said: I will deceive him. And the Lord said to him: By

                                    <p>22 And he said: I will go forth, and be a lying spirit, in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said: Thou shalt
                                    deceive <i>him</i>, and shalt prevail: *go forth, and do so.</p>
                                    <p>23 Now, therefore, behold the Lord hath given a lying spirit, in the mouth of all thy prophets that are here, and the Lord
                                    hath spoken evil against thee.</p>
                                    <p>24 And Sedecias, the son of Chanaana, came, and struck Micheas on the cheek, and said: Hath then the spirit of the Lord
                                    left me, and spoken to thee?</p>
                                    <p>25 And Micheas said: Thou shalt see, in the day when thou shalt go into a chamber, within a chamber, to hide thyself.</p>
                                    <p>26 And the king of Israel said: Take Micheas, and let him abide with Amon, the governor of the city, and with Joas, the
                                    son of Amalech;</p>
                                    <p>27 And tell them: Thus saith the king: Put this man in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction, and water of distress,
                                    till I return in peace.</p>
                                    <p>28 And Micheas said: If thou return in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me. And he said: Hear, all ye people.</p>
                                    <p>29 So the king of Israel, and Josaphat, king of Juda, went up to Ramoth-Galaad.</p>
                                    <p>30 And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: Take <i>thy</i> armour, and go into the battle, and put on thy own garments.
                                    But the king of Israel changed his dress, and went into the battle.</p>
                                    <p>31 And the king of Syria had commanded the two and thirty captains of the chariots, saying: You shall not fight against
                                    any, small or great, but against the king of Israel only.</p>
                                    <p>32 So when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat, they suspected that he was the king of Israel, and making a violent
                                    assault, they fought against him: and Josaphat cried out.</p>
                                    <p>33 And the captains of the chariots perceived that he was not the king of Israel, and they turned away from him.</p>
                                    <p>34 And a certain man bent his bow, shooting at a venture, and chanced to strike the king of Israel, between the lungs and
                                    the stomach. But he said to the driver of his chariot: Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the army, for I am grievously wounded.</p>
                                    <p>35 And the battle was fought that day, and the king of Israel stood in his chariot against the Syrians, and he died in
                                    the evening: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</p>
                                    <p>36 And the herald proclaimed through all the army, before the sun set, saying: Let every man return to his own city, and
                                    to his own country.</p>
                                    <p>37 And the king died, *and was carried into Samaria: and they buried the king in Samaria.</p>
                                    <p>38 *And they washed his chariot in the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood, and they washed the reins according
                                    to the word of the Lord which he had spoken.</p>
                                    <p>39 But the rest of the acts of Achab, and all that he did, and the house of ivory that he made, and all the cities that
                                    he built, are they not written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?</p>
                                    <p>40 So Achab slept with his fathers; and Ochozias, his son, reigned in his stead.</p>
                                    <p>41 But Josaphat, the son of Asa, began to reign over Juda, in the fourth year *of Achab, king of Israel.</p>
                                    <p>42 He was five and thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned five and twenty years in Jerusalem: the name
                                    of his mother was Azuba, the daughter of Salai.</p>
                                    <p>43 And he walked in all the way of Asa, his father, and he declined not from it: and he did that which was right in the
                                    sight of the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>44 Nevertheless, he took not away the high places: for as yet the people offered sacrifices, and burnt incense in the high
                                    places.</p>
                                    <p>45 And Josaphat had peace with the king of Israel.</p>
                                    <p>46 But the rest of the acts of Josaphat, and his works which he did, and his battles, are they not written in the Book
                                    of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?</p>
                                    <p>47 And the remnant also of the effeminate, who remained in the days of Asa, his father, he took out of the land.</p>
                                    <p>48 And there was then no king appointed in Edom.</p>
                                    <p>49 But king Josaphat made navies on the sea, *to sail into Ophir for gold: but they could not go, **for the ships were
                                    broken in Asiongaber.</p>
                                    <p>50 Then Ochozias, the son of Achab, said to Josaphat: Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. And Josaphat would
                                    not.</p>
                                    <p>51 And *Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, his father: and Joram, his son,
                                    reigned in his stead.</p>
                                    <p>52 And Ochozias, the son of Achab, began to reign over Israel, in Samaria, in the seventeenth year of *Josaphat, king of
                                    Juda, and he reigned over Israel two years.</p>
                                    <p>53 And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father and his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam,
                                    the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin.</p>
                                    <p>54 He served also Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked the Lord, the God of Israel, according to all that his father
                                    had done.</p>
