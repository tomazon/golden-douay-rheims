                           <i>Daughter.</i> Bury thy dead, and delay thy return no longer. The Israelites did not soon make use of the leave granted
                           by Cyrus. (Calmet) --- <i>Man.</i> Hebrew, "a hero." (Tirinus) --- The fathers generally explain this of the incarnation.
                           (Calmet) --- Christ had the perfect use of reason in the virgin's womb. (Haydock) --- He was the brightness of his Father's
                           glory, Hebrew i. 3. Even some ancient Jews apply this to the Messias. (Galatin. vii. 14.) But the moderns understand that
                           women would offer themselves in marriage; the times would be so happy. This was not so unusual in countries where polygamy
                           prevailed, Ruth iii. 9., Isaias iv. 1., and Canticle of Canticles viii. 1. (Calmet) --- Hence this is hardly the meaning;
                           for God promises something <i>new.</i> (Haydock) --- "The Lord hath created a new <i>thing</i> in a woman." (Aquila) --- Symmachus
                           agrees nearly with the Septuagint, "because the Lord has created thee by salvation a new plantation. Men shall go about in
                           <i>thy</i> salvation." This "might be explained, if it were not sacrilegious to argue respecting God's word by human sense,"
                           says St. Jerome; though this censure of "the Vulgate" (Septuagint) seems rather harsh. He complains here of his copy. Theodoret
                           explains it of the apostles going through the world to spread the gospel. (Haydock) --- Behold whence thy happiness must come,
                           (Menochius) O thou who hast so long proved faithless, going <i>astray after many lovers.</i> (Haydock) --- Christ, in his
                           mother's womb, was in stature small, but a perfect man (Worthington) in the use of reason, &amp;c. (Haydock)</font></p><b>
