                           the multitude had eaten and were filled, they did not take the remains; but these the disciples collected, as in the former
                           miracle of the multiplication of the loaves. By this circumstance we are taught to be content with what is sufficient, and
                           to seek no unnecessary supplies. We may likewise learn from this stupendous miracle the providence of God and his goodness,
                           who sends us not away fasting, but wishes all to be nourished and enriched with his grace. (Theophylactus) --- Thus does our
                           Lord verify in his works what he has promised in his instructions; that if we will seek in the first instance the kingdom
                           of God and his justice, that all necessary things shall be added unto us. By the gathering up of the fragments that remained,
                           he not only made the miracle more striking to the multitude and to the apostles, but has also left us a practical lesson,
                           how, in the midst of plenty, which proceeds from the munificence of heaven, we must suffer no waste. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           the names in Sts. Matthew and Mark: 1. <I>Idem locus erat binominis,</I> the same place might have two names. 2. <I>Propiqua
                           erant loca,</I> the places were near. 3. <I>Alterum erat regio, alterum vicus,</I> the one was the name of the territory,
                           the other of the town or village; and concludes with asserting from Jewish authorities, that it was the same territory in
                           which the two villages <I>Magedan</I> and <I>Dalmanutha</I> were situated; so that it might be known by either name, as we

                           inhabitants of Bethsaida had already rendered themselves unworthy of the miracles of Christ. For among them our Saviour had
                           wrought many miracles, yet they would not believe. (St. Matthew xi. 21.) (Tirinus) (Theophylactus) --- Dionysius says, that
                           Jesus led him from the multitude to shew that if a sinner, figured by the blind man, wishes to be converted from his evil
