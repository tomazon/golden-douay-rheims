                           of heaven followeth and approveth this on earth; as is plain by the words of our Saviour, to Peter first, and then to all
                           the apostles: <I>Whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall by bound also in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose
                           upon earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven.</I> See Matthew xvi. 19. and xviii. 18. Whereupon St. Jerome sayeth: that priests
