                           as possible, the better to run and fight. (Witham) --- This Christian's life is both a race and a combat. In baptism we enter

                           us, if we imitate his virtues: let us then rejoice to suffer with our Captain (<i><u>archegon</u></i>) here, and we shall

                           <i>Whose voice then moved the earth,</i> by such signs and prodigies on Mount Sinai: <i>but now he promiseth, saying</i> by
                           the prophet Aggeus[Haggai]: <i>yet once; and I will move not only the earth, but heaven also.</i> These words of the prophet
                           are commonly understood of Christ's first coming at his incarnation, when at his birth a star appeared, Angels were sent,
                           and sung his praises, when the heavens opened at his baptism, when the earth trembled at his resurrection, when the sun and
                           moon were darkened at his death, &amp;c. Yet others expound these words of Christ's coming to redeem mankind, so as to comprehend
                           all the time of the law of grace, and even his second coming to judge all men, at the end of the world, of which may particularly
                           be understood those words, (ver. 27.) of <i>the translation of the moveable things;</i> that is, of the elements, and of the
                           heavens changed to a more perfect state. See here St. Chrysostom; St. Augustine, lib. 18. de civ. Dei. chap. xxxv. p. 517.
