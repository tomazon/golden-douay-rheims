                           "the intelligent," was perhaps the common name of the kings of <I>Asor,</I> the most powerful city in the northern parts of
                           the country, (ver. 10.; Calmet) not far from the Cæsarea, (Menochius) which was built by Philip, where Lais stood before.
                           (Haydock) --- Josue burnt Asor to the ground; but it was rebuilt by the Chanaanites, and a powerful king reigned here, and
                           subjugated the Israelites, about 130 years after the death of Josue, Judges iv. 1. (Calmet) --- Being the most interested
                           in this warfare, Jabin assembled all the petty kings of the country as far as Dor, to resist the common enemy. (Haydock) ---
                           He was the generalissimo, (Grotius) and went to stop the progress of Josue, who had conquered the southern parts, and was

                           says they had 300,000 foot, 10,000 horse, and 20,000 chariots. These were frequently armed with scythes. The ancient heroes

                           had proceeded from Galgal to Meron, about 90 miles; or if he had to go to the Semonite lake, 120 miles. Josephus says he had
