                           religious man, and one that feared God.</EM> He was not a Jew, yet believed in one God. --- <EM>Always,</EM> that is, frequently
                           <I>praying,</I> and <I>giving alms.</I> In the Rheims Testament we find this note: "Hereby it appeareth, that such works as
                           are done before justification, though they suffice not to salvation, yet are acceptable preparatives for the grace of justification,
                           and such as move God to mercy. ... though all such preparative works come also of grace." These Douay divines did not hold
                           with the Quenellists that a true faith, or the habit of faith, must needs be the first grace. (Witham) --- Cornelius religiously
                           observed the law of nature, and the principal points of the Jewish moral law, though he did not profess Judaism. (Calmet)
                           --- He was an admirable example of virtue before his knowledge of Christianity. He feared God, and brought up his family in
                           the same holy fear. He was leader of the first band, and consequently had the eagle, the Roman ensign, carried before him.
                           Four hundred men were under his command. (Tirinus) --- "His former goodness could no longer avail him, unless he were, by
                           the bond of Christian society and peace, incorporated with the Church; he is therefore ordered to send unto Peter, that by
                           him he may learn Christ, by him he may be baptized." (St. Augustine, lib. i. de bap. chap. 8.) --- <I>Alms.</I> Nothing is
                           more efficacious than the alms of a man, whose hands have not been defiled by injustice. It is a clear stream, refreshing
                           in the heat of day, and imparting verdure to every plant that is near it. It is a fountain springing to eternal life. It is
                           a tree, whose branches reach even to heaven, and which produces its eternal fruit in abundance, when death has removed from
                           you all that is temporal. Waste not, then, your treasures in selfish gratifications, the fruit of which is sorrow; but feed
                           the poor, and the hungry. Plant and sow in their hands, and your produce will be great; no soil is more fertile. (St. Chrysostom,
                           hic. hom. xxii.)</FONT></P><B>

                           hours for prayer were appointed both in the old and new law. Of this St. Cyprian writes: "In celebrating their prayers, we
                           find that the three children of Daniel observed the third, sixth, and ninth hour. Thus afterwards, at the third hour, the
                           Holy Ghost descended upon the apostles, fulfilling the grace of our Lord's promise: at the sixth hour, Peter going up to the
                           higher room of the house, was both by voice and sign from God instructed, that all nations should be admitted to the grace
                           of salvation, of which he before doubted; and our Lord being crucified at the sixth hour, at the ninth washed away our sins
                           by his blood. But to us, besides the seasons observed of old, the set times of praying are increased; for we must pray in
                           the morning early, that the resurrection of our Lord may be celebrated by morning prayer; <I>in the morning early will I stand
                           before Thee, early in the morning wilt thou hear my voice.</I> (Psalm v.) Towards the evening also, when the sun departeth,
                           we must of necessity pray again." (De Orat. Dom. No. 15) St. Jerome, writing to Eustochia, a virgin, and a religious, (ep.
                           22.) says, "though the apostle bid us to pray always, and, to holy persons, their very sleep is prayer; yet we must have distinct
                           hours for prayer, that if perhaps we be otherwise occupied, the very time may admonish us of our duty. The third, sixth, ninth
                           hour, morning early, and evening, no man can be ignorant of."</FONT></P><B>

                           of Moses. It may seem strange that even St. Peter should not know that the ceremonial precepts of the law were to be abolished.
                           It may be answered, that St. Peter and they, were only ignorant of the time, when they were to be laid aside; and so St. Chrysostom
                           says, that the conversion of Cornelius, with all its circumstances, was to convince the Jews, rather than the apostles, that
                           those ceremonies were no longer obligatory. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           the sheep under one shepherd. Jesus Christ, by his blood, had generally reconciled all mankind to his Father. In this sense
                           all were pure; that is, all had a right, as all were called, to partake of the merits of the Son of God. All had a right to
                           communicate in the truths of the gospel, and in the sacraments, which were the appointed channels, through which the graces
                           and merits of Jesus Christ were applied. (Calmet) --- Here, then, God first announced to Peter, that the time was come to
                           preach to the Gentiles unto salvation, no less than to the Jews; with full freedom to eat all meats, without respect to the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And he saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were

                                    he had seen should mean, behold the men who were sent by Cornelius, inquiring for Simon's house, stood at the gate.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And when they had called, they asked, if Simon, who is surnamed Peter,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 Arise, therefore, go down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 Then Peter going down to the men, said: Behold I am he whom you seek:

                                    his house, and to hear words from thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Then bringing them in, he lodged them. And the day following, he arose

                                    for them, having called together his kinsmen, and special friends.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And it came to pass, when Peter was come in, Cornelius met him, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 But Peter raised him up, saying: Arise, I myself also am a man.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And Cornelius said: Four days ago, until this hour, I was praying

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 Immediately, therefore, I sent to thee: and thou hast done well in
