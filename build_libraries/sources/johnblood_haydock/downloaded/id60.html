                           destruction of Jerusalem there appeared many impostors, many who professed themselves to be the Christ, and assured the populace
                           that their delivery was at hand. And in the Church many heresiarchs started up, and many came in the name of Christ; the first
                           of these was Simon Magus, mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, whom the people of Samaria received as the power and virtue
                           of God. But it is remarkable from the time of our Saviour's passion, when they preferred the robber Barabbas to Jesus Christ,
                           the Lamb of God, they had no peace or quiet in the city, but constant tumult and dissension succeeded, to the very time of
                           its destruction. (Ven. Bede) --- So shall many seducers come towards the end of the world, who shall make themselves authors
                           of sects, and shall gain many disciples: as followeth in plain words, ver. 22. of this chapter. (Bristow)</FONT></P><B>

                           had seized upon the minds of the disciples, when they were informed by their divine Master, that they should stand accused
                           before kings, and princes of the earth, for fear they should not be able, for want of human learning, to make a proper defence.
                           Our Saviour therefore says: be not thoughtful beforehand; for when we are brought to the bar in defence of our holy faith,
                           it is only necessary for us, under such circumstances, to make an offer of our will; Christ himself will speak for us: and

                           Bede here gives a beautiful illustration of this passage in a spiritual sense. When, says he, we see the abomination of desolation
                           standing where it ought not, that is, when we behold heresies and crimes reigning where we ought to see truth and virtue flourish,
                           then let those who are in Judea, such as have kept the true faith unpolluted, flee to the mountains; that is, rise to the
                           height of perfection; and let those who are on the house-top, those who crucifying the works of the flesh, live according
                           to the spirit, not descend any more to their former way of living according to the flesh. (Ven. Bede) --- If all heresies
                           tend to the abomination of desolation, that more particularly does which taketh away with other sacrament, and the external
                           worship of God, the very sacrifice of Christ's body and blood; which being taken away, as St. Cyprian remarketh, no religion
                           can remain. (St. Cyprian, on the supper of our Lord. Num. ii.)</FONT></P><B>

                           may be explained in a more general sense of the persecution of Antichrist, which will be dreadful beyond description, and
                           executed in every part of the world. The time however allowed to him and his wicked agents to tread under foot the holy city,
                           (Apocalypse xi. 2.) i.e. the Church of Christ, will not extend beyond forty-two months, or three years and a half. This space
                           of time Christ has set apart to purify his Church, and try his servants; and therefore he allows them to fall under the power
                           of this merciless tyrant; and it was given unto him, says St. John, speaking of this event, to make war with the saints, and
                           overcome them. (Apocalypse xiii. 7.) We are admonished of the same by the prophet Daniel: (vii. 21.) I beheld, says he, and
                           lo that horn (Antichrist) made war against the saints, and prevailed against them; and he shall speak words against the Most
                           High, and shall crush the saints of the Most High ... and they shall be delivered into his hand until a time, and times, and
                           half a time, (Daniel vii. 25.) i.e. a year, two years, and half a year, or three years and a half, the same with St. John.
                           (Pastorini, p. 327 and 8.) --- St. Augustine, speaking of this dreadful period, says: this persecution will be the last; it
                           will happen towards the approach of the last judgment, and will fall upon the Church in every part of the world; that is,
                           the whole city of Christ will be persecuted by the whole city of the devil, as far as both are extended upon earth. (De civit.
                           lib. xx. chap. xi.) But our Saviour will put a stop to these calamities on account of his elect, unwilling that they should
                           be tempted above their strength; for he will descend himself from heaven, and, as St. Paul tells us, will kill the wicked
                           man, Antichrist, with the breath of his mouth, and shall destroy him with the brightness of his coming.</FONT></P><B>

                           how can the Son be ignorant of that last day? Were this the case, we must thence conclude that his nature was imperfect: since
                           he was under the <I>necessity</I> of a second coming, and yet was ignorant when that time should be. But we must remember,
                           that the meaning of this sentence is not, that Christ was really ignorant of this circumstance, but only that it was not then
                           a convenient time to disclose the secret. (St. Augustine) --- Not as if Christ were ignorant himself, as certain Eutychian
                           heretics, called <EM>Agnoitæ,</EM> held; but because he knew it not as our teacher, to teach it others, as being not expedient.
                           (St. Ambrose, de fide, lib. v. chap. viii.) --- The Son of God is ignorant of this day, not according to his <I>divinity,</I>
                           which sees and knows all things; but according to his <I>humanity,</I> which does not know it of itself, of its own light,
                           but by revelation which is made to it by the divinity, which is intimately united to it. <I>In naturâ quidem divinitatis novit,</I>

                           will perhaps think, that it would have been much better, if the Almighty had not left the hour of death uncertain; as in that
                           case, they would not have been so solicitous with regard to its arrival. But St. Augustine, St. Gregory, and other saints
                           assure us, on the contrary, that it is a very great mercy of God to keep us in this ignorance, that we may always be prepared
                           for it. For, if we knew the precise period, this assurance would give occasion of living more unguardedly, and of sinning
                           more freely. If, with this uncertainty of the hour of our death, we live notwithstanding, so very remissly; what should we
                           do, were we assured that we were not to die for some years? Sts. Gregory, Augustine, and Bonaventure say, that God chose to
                           leave us in this uncertainty, purposely to prevent all attachment to temporal things; that, seeing every hour, nay every moment,
                           we may lose them, we may not be tied to them, but aspire to those we shall always possess, when once we have obtained them.
