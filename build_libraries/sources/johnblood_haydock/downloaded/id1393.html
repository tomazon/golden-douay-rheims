                           <i>Month;</i> April 30, the year of the world 3430. (Usher) (Calmet) --- In explaining this last most obscure vision: <b>I.</b>
                           The Jews say it was verified after the captivity. But thus the temple would be four miles round, and the city thirty-six,
                           which never was the case. <b>II.</b> Hence more modern Jews assert it will be fulfilled by the Messias. <b>III.</b> Rejecting
                           these errors, Lyranus, &amp;c., suppose that the promise was conditional, and that the sins of the Jews prevented the city
                           and temple from being so large; and that the mystical temple of the Church is also insinuated, into which both Jews and Gentiles
                           shall enter. <b>IV.</b> Though this opinion be probable, it seems better to follow St. Jerome, St. Gregory, &amp;c., who cannot
                           apply all to the Old Testament, nor think that such a huge temple and city were indeed promised, but explain some parts of
                           the captives at their return, as a figure of those redeemed by Christ, and brought into his Church, which is adorned with
                           all graces. Yet the greatest part must be understood of the Church triumphant. (Worthington) --- St. Jerome confesses his
                           ignorance of this subject; and those who have come after him, though they imitate not his modesty, add little to dissipate
                           the mist with which this vision is surrounded. Some have adhered too close to Josephus, while Villalpand has here discovered
                           all the magnificence of Greek and Roman architecture, and has represented the temple six times as large as it really was.
                           It seems that the prophet has described the same temple of Solomon which he had seen, that the dimensions might be preserved,
                           and the hopes of the people kept up; (Calmet) and that they might comprehend what a loss they actually sustained on account
                           of their sins, (Haydock) and might strive to come up to this pattern (Du Hamel) as "near as they should be able," the wealth
                           of the people being much less than Solomon's. (Grotius) --- These arguments do not, however, shew that the buildings were
                           to resemble each other. They vary in many particulars; and the prophet would specify what was to be really executed. He says
                           nothing of the ornamental part, and little of the height, which are the most expensive. (Houbigant) (Preface) --- If some
                           things appear to be too grand for the temple of Solomon, and of Zorobabel, we must reflect that the prophet passes from the
                           figure to the Church of Christ, which is not unusual. (Menochius) --- Alcasar and Bossuet explain it wholly of the Church,
                           so that the letter requires few notes. (Du Hamel)</font></p><b>

                           from the north, though the temple lay on that side of the town, Psalm xlvii. 2. (Calmet) --- Septuagint read <i>mongod,</i>
                           "over-against," instead of <i>mongob,</i> "south," which has perplexed many. (Houbigant) --- Ezechiel was placed on Sion,
                           which was not <i>very high,</i> but here it denotes the Church. Jerusalem was in ruins. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           six palms, while the common one had only five, (chap. xliii. 13.; Worthington) being half a yard; (Arbuthnot) or the Hebrew
                           cubit was a hand's breadth larger than the Babylonian, or about 21½ inches, (Calmet) which may be styled (Menochius) the sacred
                           cubit. (Arbuthnot) (Haydock) --- <i>Reed.</i> This outer wall (Calmet; Menochius) was to prevent any from falling down the
                           precipice. It was about four yards nine inches in height and thickness, being so solid in order that the ground might not
                           give way. Josephus describes prodigious walls, (Haydock) reaching to the bottom of the mountain, three hundred cubits on the
                           south and west; but then the temple was much enlarged. (Calmet)</font></p><b>
