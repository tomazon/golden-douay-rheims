                           should speak with dignity and authority; and, as in the course of it he reproves false apostles who taught from themselves,

                           of Christ's incarnation. The construction of this and the former verse is imperfect, when it is said, <I>as I desired thee,</I>

                           in this epistle I desire it of thee again. The same difficulty occurs in the Greek as in the Latin text. (Witham) --- The
                           Jews were accustomed to dispute and make endless questions concerning their origin from Abraham, Isaac, and other patriarchs,
                           and concerning their different tribes, which their captivity had confounded together. Hence there was no end of their questions,
                           how, when, why? which gave rise to many fables, to the great disturbance of the faithful. Whereas, they ought to have taken
                           the shortest way to edification, which was to confine themselves to what was of faith. (St. Ambrose)</FONT></P><B>
