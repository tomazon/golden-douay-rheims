                           of Janus remained shut for 12 years. (Jansenius, concord. Evan.) --- It was the custom among the Jews to be numbered according
                           to their tribes and families. Hence arose the necessity of the journey of the Holy Family to Nazareth [to Bethlehem?]. This

                           the eastern side of the town of Bethlehem, say St. Justin, St. Jerome, &amp;c. there was a cave cut in the side of a rock,
                           in which was a manger used by the people of those environs; so that these shepherds easily understood the angel, who told
                           them they should find him laid in a manger. Sts. Jerome, Gregory of Nazianzus, Cyril, say that they found the child between
                           an ox and an ass, according to the version of the Septuagint. Habacuc iii. 2.: <I>You shall find him laid between two beasts.</I>
                           In the place where this crib was, St. Helen built a magnificent church in honour of the blessed Virgin Mary. Ven. Bede says
                           that she built another in honour of the tree shepherds; whence St. Bernard concludes, that there were only three shepherds
                           that came to adore the divine infant in the manger. (Tirinus) --- It might be necessary to give them notice of this humble
                           appearance of the Messias, to encourage them to go and pay him their homage. (Barradius)</FONT></P><B>

                           on earth, peace to men of good will.</I>[1] I had translated, <I>peace to men of his good will,</I> looking upon the sense
                           to be, that a peace and reconciliation were offered, and given to men from the good will and mercy of God. The ordinary Greek
                           copies altogether favour this exposition. And Bellarmine (lib. ii, de Verb. D. chap. 11.) is so convinced of this sense, that
                           he brings it for an instance of one of those places, in which the true sense of the Latin is to be found by the Greek text;
                           which is many times true: but Bellarmine might not take notice, that several of the best Greek manuscripts are conformable
                           to the Latin Vulgate, and have <I>peace to men of good will;</I> as it is also expounded by divers of the ancient Fathers,
                           that peace is offered to men of good will, to those who by the grace of God are disposed to believe and obey the Gospel-doctrine.
                           And upon this, having advised with others, I did not think fit to change the former Rheimish translation. (Witham) --- The
                           reason why the will is designated in preference to any other power of the soul, is, because the will moves the rest; consequently
                           the goodness or badness of an action depends chiefly on the will. By this also the angels wished to shew, that the peace which
                           Christ came to bring into the world, was the internal peace of our souls, of which the external peace that subsisted under
                           Augustus, was a figure. (Nicholas of Lyra) --- Peace is made on earth, since human nature, before an enemy of God, is now
                           reconciled and united to him by his incarnation. (Theophylactus) --- In this hymn of the angels there is a remarkable difference
                           observable in some of the Greek and Latin copies. The latter have it according to this text, <I>men of good will;</I> the
                           former,<I> good will among men, or to men.</I>&nbsp;<I><U>Eudokia</U>,</I> signifies the gratuitous benevolence of God towards
                           man. So that this sentence seems divided into three parts: glory to God, peace on earth, and good will to men. (Jansenius,
                           conc. Evang.) --- The birth of Christ giveth not peace of mind, or salvation, but to such as are of good will, because he
                           worketh not our good against our wills, but with the concurrence of our will. (St. Augustine, quæst. ad Simplic. lib. 1. q.

                           the reality of his human nature, and the difference between his divinity and humanity; 2. to shew he approved of circumcision,
                           which he had instituted; 3. to prove that he was of the seed of Abraham; 4. to teach us humility and obedience, by observing
