                           whole company, and disposed them to receive the gift of heaven with humility and fervour. This noise appears to have been
                           heard over a great part of the city, and to have gathered together a great crowd, who came to learn the cause. This noise
                           and wind were symbols of the divinity. It was thus also that formerly on Mount Sinai, thunder and lightning, the dark cloud,
                           the smoking mountain, &amp;c. marked the majesty of God. (Calmet) --- Jesus Christ, our Pasch, to answer perfectly the figure,
                           was offered on the day of the great Jewish passover; so fifty days after, for accomplishing the like figure of the law given
                           on Mount Sinai, He sent down the Holy Ghost on the day of their <I>Pentecost,</I> which meaneth fifty. But our feasts, as
                           St. Augustine remarks, besides the remembrance of benefits past, contain great mysteries also of the life to come. (Ep. cxix.

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 Foreseeing he spoke of the resurrection of Christ, *for neither was

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 This Jesus hath God raised up again, whereof we are all witnesses.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 For David did not ascend into heaven: but he himself said; *The Lord

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 But Peter said to them; Do penance, and be baptized, every one of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 They therefore that received his word were baptized: and there were

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles, and in

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done
                                    by the apostles in Jerusalem, and there was great fear in all.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 And all they that believed were together, and had all things common.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">46 And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread
                                    from house to house, they took their meat with gladness and simplicity of heart:</font></p>
