                           their is a faith of beginners, and a faith of the perfect. The incipient faith this man already possessed, and he besought
                           our Saviour to help him to the higher degrees of this virtue. No one becomes great and perfect all at once, but must first
                           set off with small beginnings, and thus gradually ascend to the height of perfection. Thus the man, who, by the inspiration
                           of grace has received imperfect faith, may be said at the same time to believe, and still to be <FONT face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">incredulous.
