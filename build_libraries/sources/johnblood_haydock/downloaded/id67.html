                           who read, it is plain, that St. John [the Baptist] not only preached baptism, but likewise conferred it upon many; yet, he
                           could not give baptism to the remission of sins. (St. Gregory, hom. xx.) --- When the victim was not yet immolated, how could
                           they obtain remission of sins? How could St. Luke say, <I>preaching the baptism of penance, for the remission of sins?</I>
                           The ignorant Jews not considering the greatness of their transgressions, St. John came exhorting them to acknowledge their
                           sins, and do penance for them; that being converted, and truly contrite, they might seek after their Redeemer, and thus obtain
                           remission of their offences. (St. Chrysostom, hom. x. in Matt.) --- From these words originated an opinion, that the baptism
                           of John remitted sins. Thus Prudentius, in his hymn on St. John:</FONT></P>

                           from two passages of Scripture: 1. Where John himself declares that he does not baptize with the Holy Ghost; and secondly,
                           in the Acts, (Chap. xix) where St. Paul orders those who had only been baptized by John, and had not heard of the Holy Ghost,
                           to be rebaptized. We must then conclude, that St. John's baptism was only a ceremony or initiation, by which they enrolled
                           themselves as his disciples, to do penance, as a preparation for the remission of sins by means of the second baptism, viz.
                           of Jesus Christ. (Jansenius, Evan. Conc.)</FONT></P><B>

                           one thing to bring forth fruits of penance, and another to bring forth <I>worthy fruits.</I> We should know that the man who
                           has committed nothing unlawful, may have a right to use the lawful things of the world, and can perform works of piety, without
                           forsaking innocent enjoyments, unless he pleases. But, if he has fallen into great crimes, let him abstain from what is lawful,
                           as much as he has transgressed, by yielding to guilt. Nor is equal penance required of him who has sinned little, and of him
                           who has fallen into many crimes. And let those, whose consciences convict them, labour to lay up a treasure of good works,
                           proportioned to the injury they have done themselves by their sins. (St. Gregory, hom. xx. in Evang.) --- It is not sufficient
                           for penitents to forsake their sins, they must also bring forth worthy fruits, according to that of the psalmist, <I>decline
                           from evil, and do good.</I> (Psalm xxxvi.) As it is not enough to extract the dart; and external application is also necessary.
                           He says not <I>fruit,</I> but <I>fruits,</I> to shew the abundance of good works we ought to perform. (St. Chrysostom, hom.
                           x. on S. Matt.) --- He does not mean to say that they did not descend from Abraham, but that their descending from Abraham
                           would avail them nothing, unless they kept up the succession of his virtues. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xi. and xii. on S. Matt.)
                           --- What can those be thought but stones, who have given themselves to the adoration of stones; to which, says the psalmist,
                           they are assimilated, who place their trust in them? By this the Baptist prophesies, that faith shall be infused into the
                           stony hearts of the Gentiles, who by faith shall become the children of Abraham. (St. Ambrose) --- Consider, says St. Chrysostom,
                           how St. John draws them from boasting of their pedigree, and trusting to their descent from Abraham, to place their hope of
                           salvation in the practice of penance and a holy life. (hom. xi.) --- A lesson this for Catholics, not to expect to find mercy
                           at the last day, for being members of the true religion, unless they live up to the maxims which it prescribes. <I>If I should
                           have all faith, so that I could move mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</I> (1 Corinthians xiii. 2.)</FONT></P><B>

                           (Witham) --- Here we are taught that whatever we have more than our own wants require, must be bestowed on those who are in

                           recommended in Scripture, as a powerful method of redeeming sin, and reconciling us to divine mercy. This was Daniel's advice
                           to king Nabuchodonosor: "May my counsel please thee, O king, and do thou redeem thy sins with alms and mercy to the poor."
                           (Daniel iv.) Hence St. Chrysostom says: "The poor are physicians, and their hands are an ointment for your wounds." (hom.
                           xiv. in ep. 1. ad Tim.) --- See the unbounded love of God; he offers us his mercy, provided we will relieve our indigent brethren!

                           reasons might have induced the people to think that John was the Christ: 1. The wonders that took place at his birth and conception,
                           his mother being very old, and without any prospect of offspring: 2. the excellence of his preaching, his mortified life,
                           and the novelty of his baptism; and thirdly, the report which then generally prevailed among the Jews, that the Messias was
                           already come; on account of the coming of the magi, and the murder of the infants by Herod: both which circumstances were

                           concerning life-giving grace, must be preserved entire. To add or to omit any thing, may exclude from life everlasting. For,
                           as we believe, so also are we baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. (St. Basil, lib.

                           <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">To make some attempt at an elucidation of the present very difficult subject
                           of inquiry, we must carry in our minds, 1. That in the Scripture language the word <I>begat,</I> applies to the remote, as
                           well as the immediate, descendant of the ancestor; so that if Marcus were the son, Titus the grandson, and Caius the great-grandson
                           of Sempronius, it might, in the language of Scripture, be said, that Sempronius begat Caius. This accounts for the omission
                           of several descents in St. Matthew. 2. The word <I>begat,</I> applies not only to the natural offspring, but to the offspring
                           assigned to the ancestor by law. 3. If a man married the daughter and&nbsp;only child of another, he became in the view of
                           the Hebrew law the son of that person, and thus was a son assigned to him by law. The two last positions shew in what sense
                           Zorobabel was the son both of Neri and Salathiel, and Joseph the son both of Jacob and of Heli, or Joachim. --- "St. Matthew,
                           in descending from Abraham to Joseph, the spouse of the blessed Virgin, speaks of a son <I>properly</I> so called, and by
                           way of <I>generation,</I> Abraham begot Isaac, &amp;c. But St. Luke in ascending from Jesus to God himself, speaks of a son
                           properly or improperly so called. On this account he make use of an indeterminate expression, in saying, <I>the son of Joseph,
                           who was of Heli.</I> That St. Luke does not always speak of a son properly called, and by way of generation, appears from
                           the first and last he names; for Jesus was only the putative son of Joseph, because Joseph was the spouse of Mary, the mother
                           of Christ; and Adam was only the son of God by <I>creation.</I> This being observed, we must acknowledge in the genealogy
                           in St. Luke, two sons improperly so called, that is, two sons-in-law, instead of sons. As among the Hebrews, the women entered
                           not into the genealogy, when a house finished by a daughter, instead of naming the daughter in the genealogy, they named the
                           son-in-law, who had for father-in-law the father of his wife. The two sons-in-law mentioned in St. Luke are Joseph, the son-in-law
                           of Heli, and Salathiel, the son-in-law of Neri. This remarks clears up the difficulty. Joseph, the son of Jacob, in St. Matthew,
                           was the son-in-law of Heli, in St. Luke; and Salathiel, the son of Jechonias, in St. Matthew, was the son-in-law of Neri,
                           in St. Luke. Mary was the daughter of Heli, Eliacim, or Joacim, or Joachim. Joseph, the son of Jacob, and Mary, the daughter
                           of Heli, had a common origin; both descending from Zorobabel, Joseph by Abiud the eldest, and Mary by Resa, the younger brother.
                           Joseph descended from the royal branch of David, of which Solomon was the chief; and Mary from the other branch, of which
                           Nathan was the chief. by Salathiel, the father of Zorobabel, and son of Jechonias, Joseph and Mary descended from Solomon,
                           the son and heir of David. And by the wife of Salathiel, the mother of Zorobabel, and daughter of Neri, of which Neri Salathiel
                           was the son-in-law, Joseph and Mary descended from Nathan, the other son of David, so that Joseph and Mary re-united in themselves
                           all the blood of David. St. Matthew carries up the genealogy of Jesus to Abraham; this was the promise of the Messias, made
                           to the Jews; St. Luke carries it up to Adam, the promise of the Messias, made to all men."</FONT></P>
                           <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">Whatever the difficulties attending the genealogies may be, it is evident
                           that they arise from our imperfect knowledge of the laws, usages, and idiom of the Jews, from our ignorance of the true method
                           of reconciling the seeming inconsistencies, or from some corruptions that in process of time may possibly have crept into
                           the text. The silence of the enemies of the gospel, both&nbsp;heathen and Jewish, during <I>even</I> the first century, is
                           itself a sufficient proof, that neither inconsistency nor corruption could be then alleged against this part of the evangelical
                           history. If the lineal descent of Jesus from David were not indisputable, he could not possess the character essential to
                           the Messias, nor any right to the Jewish throne. We may confidently then assert, that his regular lineal descent from David
                           could not be disproved, since it was not even disputed at a time when alone it could have been done so successfully; and by
                           those persons who were so deeply interested in falsifying the first Christian authorities.</FONT></P><B>

                           citations are conformable to the Septuagint. Others conjecture that Cainan and Sale were only different names of one and the
