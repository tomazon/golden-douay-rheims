                           <I>And in the end of the sabbath, when it began to dawn towards the first day of the week.</I> According to the letter, <I>in
                           the evening of the sabbath, which began to dawn on the first of the sabbath;</I> (or of the <I>sabbaths</I> in the common
                           Greek copies.) This latter translation, which is that of the Rheims Testament, is certainly more according to the letter,
                           and more obscure than it need to be. First, by translating, <I>on the first of the sabbath,</I> where sabbath is taken for
                           <I>a week,</I> as in other places, Luke xviii. 12.; Acts xx. 7.; and 1 Corinthians xvi. 2. It may therefore here be literally
                           translated, <I>on the first day of the week.</I> Secondly, By the <I>evening,</I> is here meant the <I>night:</I> for in the
                           Scriptures, both the Latin and Greek word, which we find in this place, not only signifies that time which we commonly call
                           the evening, but is also put for the whole night itself, and for the time from sunset to sunrise next morning. Thus it is
                           taken in the first chapter of Genesis, where, in the computation of natural days of 24 hours, all the hours in which it was
                           dark, are called <I>vespere,</I> in the Septuagint. And all the hours in which it was light, are called <I>mane,&nbsp;<U>proi</U>.
                           et factum est vespere &amp; mane dies unus,</I> i.e. <I>primus.</I> And from the fourth day, on which were created <I>sun</I>
                           and <I>moon,</I> by <I>vespere</I> was understood all the time from the sun setting on such parts of the earth, to its rising
                           to them again: and <I>mane</I> signified all the day, or the hours that the sun appeared to the like parts of the earth. Therefore,
                           the literal and proper sense of the verse is: <I>in the night,</I> i.e. in the latter part of the night of the sabbath, or
                           after the sabbath, <I>towards the morning of the first day of the week.</I> And that in this place is signified the latter
                           part of the night, and not what is commonly called the evening, appears first by the following words, <I>when it began to
                           dawn,</I> or to be light. Secondly, It appears by the other evangelists. St. Mark (xvi. 1.) says, <I>when the sabbath was
                           past ... very early in the morning.</I> St. Luke says, (xxiv. 1,) <I>very early in the morning.</I> St. John (xx. 1.) says
                           of Mary Magdalene, that <I>she came in the morning, when it was yet dark.</I> From all which it is plain, that Mary Magdalene,
                           and the other pious women, came to the sepulchre at the end of the night after the sabbath-day, or when it began to be light,
                           and about sunrise on the first day of the week, on our Sunday. --- There may indeed be some doubt whether the Latin word <I>vespere</I>
                           be not an adverb, corresponding to the Greek <I><U>opse</U>, <I><FONT size=3>serņ.</I></FONT></I> And then it may be translated
                           with Dr. Wells: <I>late in the night after the sabbath, as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week.</I> But this
                           makes no difference at all as to the sense. <I>And the other Mary,</I> &amp;c. St. Mark says, <I>Mary,</I> the mother <I>of
                           James and Salome.</I> St. Luke also names <I>Joanna,</I> who was wife to Chusa, Herod's steward. These women had rested the
                           sabbath, and as soon as it was over, i.e. after sunset, they bought spices, and prepared them in the night, in order to embalm
                           the body next morning. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           ... an angel.</I> The angel did not remove the stone to afford a passage to Christ when he arose; for Christ most certainly
                           arose before the angel appeared; but he removed the stone to prepare the way for the women, and to shew the soldiers that
                           Christ was arisen. He sat on the stone, that the women might know he had removed it; and, in the second place, that they might
                           not be terrified at the appearance of the soldiers; for he exhorted them not to fear, but to come and see; and lastly, to
                           prevent the soldiers from putting in another body, had they been so disposed. The holy women seem not to have known that there
                           were guards placed near the sepulchre; otherwise they would not have been so solicitous who should roll away the stone for
                           them, as how they should deceive the guards and break the seal. (Tirinus) --- <I>For an angel of the Lord.</I> This angel,
                           who came to testify Christ's resurrection, removed the <I>great stone;</I> but Christ was risen before, who according to all
                           the fathers, says Estius, rose, the sepulchre being yet shut.[2] --- St. Matthew and St. Mark name but one angel; St. Luke
                           and St. John name <I>two.</I> It may be answered, that the women saw <I>one</I> at one time, and <I>two</I> at another: one
                           upon the stone, out of the monument; (which also frightened the guards) afterwards this angel disappeared, and the women coming
                           near, and looking into the vault, <I>saw two angels,</I> when he that was on the right side said, <I>why seek you him that
                           is living, among the dead?</I> --- Another difference to be observed, is, that Sts. Matthew, Mark and John tell us, that the
                           angel, or angels, <I>sat;</I> and St. Luke, that they <I>stood:</I> they might <I>sit</I> at one time, and <I>stand</I> at
                           another. Besides that in the style of the Scriptures, <I>standing,</I> or <I>sitting,</I> many times imply no more than that
                           they were present there. --- In the third place, we take notice that Mary Magdalene seems to have come running to St. Peter,
                           and St. John, as soon as she saw the stone removed, with these words, <I>They have taken away the Lord ... and we know not
                           where they have laid him:</I> John xx. 2, we do not there read that she said any thing of the angels. Or perhaps St. Peter
                           and St. John ran away before they heard all that Magdalene had to say. In all these there is no contradiction; and the difficulties
                           rise only from this, that each evangelist does not relate all the circumstances. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           storm of calamities had nearly overwhelmed their faith, and the weight of temptations had so enfeebled their understanding,
                           that they came to seek the Lord of heaven as one dead among the dead. (St. Jerome) --- The angel blushes not to style Jesus
                           the <I>crucified;</I> for this is now the height and perfection of all good. By these glad tidings he endeavoured to expel

                           on the testimony of their Redeemer's promises, who had frequently assured them that on the third day he should rise again.

                           <I>Jesus met them.</I> According to St. Mark, Christ appeared first to Mary Magdalene; and the particulars are related by

                           the Scripture a species of veneration; (see Exodus iv. 25; 4 Kings iv. 27.) as among the Greeks, the touching of the knees.

                           assembled together, when the two returned from Emmaus. And after the day of his resurrection, before he ascended into heaven,
                           he appeared other five times: 1. after eight days, when Thomas was present; 2. when the seven disciples were fishing on the
                           sea of Tiberias; (St. John chap. xxi.) 3. to the eleven on Mount Thabor; 4. in Jerusalem, on the day of his ascension; and
                           5. on the same day on Mount Olivet, when he was taken from them. (Denis the Carthusian) --- The <I>seventh</I> apparition
                           of Jesus, which was by the sea or lake of Tiberias, St. John calls the <I>third,</I> which may mean in any numerous assembly
                           of his disciples; the first being on the day of his resurrection, and the second the Sunday following. This may also be referred
                           to the number of days. He first appeared to different persons on the very day of his resurrection; secondly, eight days afterwards,
                           and then a third time. (St. Augustine) --- The history of our Lord's different apparitions in not very clear, and it is necessary
                           to have recourse to the first chapter of the Acts, and to the 15th chapter of St. Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians.
                           St. Augustine says, (lib. iii. de cons. Evang. chap. xxv,) that there are ten apparitions of our Lord recorded in the four
                           evangelists, which he specifies; but Maldonatus, on the 28th chap. of St. Matthew enumerates 13 different apparitions.</FONT></P><B>

                           hence appears, that the chief priests themselves were fully convinced of the fact; for otherwise, they would not have bribed
                           the soldiers to dissemble, but would have accused the soldiers before the president of a neglect of duty. (Tirinus) --- How
                           was it possible for the timid and weak disciples, who dared not shew themselves in public, to come in defiance of an armed
                           multitude to steal away the body! If these men dared not even to come forward in defence of their Master when alive, is it
                           probable that these same men after his death would steal away his body? And could they, even allowing the possibility of conceiving
                           the design, have removed the stone, which required a great number of hands to stir?&nbsp; Was not the mouth of the sepulchre
                           also sealed?&nbsp; But why did they not steal away the body the&nbsp;first night,&nbsp;before the guards were stationed? For
                           it was on Saturday the priests petitioned for a guard. Why did they not also take the clothes, which St. Peter saw lying in
                           the sepulchre? Would not a delay in taking off the clothes, and the napkin that bound his head, have appeared dangerous? Would
                           it not have exposed their lives, particularly as the body had been anointed, and some time would be requisite to remove the
                           linen, which would adhere to the body? The means they take to make the miracle uncertain, render it utterly undeniable. For
                           in protesting that the disciples stole it away, they confessed that the body was no longer in the sepulchre. The fear and
                           doubts of the disciples, joined to the idle story of the soldiers, is an evident demonstration, that the account of the body
                           being stolen away, is a gross calumny. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xc.) --- But let us again see how beautifully Sedulius paints

                           eleven disciples went into Galilee,</I> yet not till above eight days after. As to the order of Christ's apparitions, in the
                           gospels: He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, and to other devout women; then to St. Peter; next to two disciples going to
                           <I>Emmaus;</I> after that to the apostles that were all together, except only St. Thomas. These apparitions were all on the
                           very day he rose from the dead. We find also (John xx,) that <I>eight days</I> after he appeared to all the eleven apostles,
                           <I>Thomas</I> being then present, to whom he said, <I>put in thy finger hither,</I> &amp;c. This is generally thought to have
                           happened at Jerusalem. When the apostles and disciples were gone into Galilee, he shewed himself to seven of them, as they
                           were fishing on the lake of Tiberias. (John xxi. 4.) We read also in this chap. (ver. 16,) that he appeared to them <I>on
                           a mountain in Galilee:</I> what mountain is was we know not. It may be of this apparition that St. Paul says, (1 Corinthians
                           xv. 6,) <I>Then was he seen by more than five hundred brethren at once.</I> He also tells us he appeared to St. James. See
                           ver. 7. But when or where this was, is not mentioned. In fine, Christ till his ascension frequently appeared to them, and
                           <I>conversed</I> with them. He taught them to <I>understand the holy Scriptures,</I> and all that belonged to their ministry:
                           he gave them <I>power to forgive sins:</I> He <I>sent</I> his apostles <I>as his heavenly Father had sent him.</I> He gave
                           in particular to St. Peter <I>the charge over his whole</I> flock: He <I>promised to send down upon them the Holy Ghost;</I>
                           and to <I>remain with them himself to the end of the world,</I> i.e. with his Church. (Witham) --- It is supposed that then
                           and there took place what St. Paul mentions, that Jesus Christ shewed himself to more than 500 of the brethren together. (Bible

                           of St. Thomas the apostle. (Witham) --- These doubted not of the resurrection or divinity of Christ, but whether the person

                           according to his human nature, was sovereign Lord of the whole world; but more properly this may be taken of his spiritual
                           power, such as regards the salvation of souls. For Jesus Christ says to Pilate, <I>my kingdom is not of this world.</I> This
                           spiritual power, Jesus Christ communicated in part to his apostles and their successors in the ministry, as to his vicars:
                           <I>As my Father hath sent me, so I send you. Whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in heaven:</I> behold

                           to the tradition and constant doctrine of the Catholic Church, received also by the pretended Reformed Churches, new born
                           children are to be baptized before they are capable of instruction: nor can they enter into the kingdom of heaven without

                           in that case, be limited to the natural lives of the apostles; but as He moreover adds, <I>even to the consummation of the
                           world,</I> it must necessarily be extended to their successors in the ministry, till the end of time. (Estius) --- By these
                           words <I>Go, teach,</I> he gives them the power of teaching not only what relates to faith, but also what is necessarily connected
                           with piety and a holy conversation. For we see added a further explanation, <I>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
                           I have commanded you;</I> which words, beyond all doubt, must be referred to the precepts of a holy life. How egregiously
                           then must those men be deceived, who infer from the words <I>teach all nations,</I> that faith alone will suffice. What follows,
                           <I>baptizing them,</I> shews another part of the pastoral functions, which consists in the administration of the sacraments.
                           Hence also all heretics are refuted, who pretend to affirm that all ecclesiastical ministry consists in barely delivering
                           the word. (Estius, in different location)</FONT></P><B>
