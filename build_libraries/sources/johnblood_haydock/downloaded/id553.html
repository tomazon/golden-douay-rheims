                           was delightfully situated, about the midst of the country, 12 miles south of Sichem. Hither the Israelites removed with the
                           ark from Galgal after having had their camp in the latter place seven years at least; the Jews say 14. But Josue might reproach
                           the Israelites for their indolence, (ver. 3,) without waiting seven years after the country was divided. --- <I>Tabernacle.</I>
                           The Jews pretend that this was not the same as that set up by Moses; and others say that <I>a house</I> was built for the
                           Lord at Silo, 1 Kings i. 23. But there seems to be no reason for these assertions. David informs us that the ark of the Lord
                           was covered with <I>skins,</I> 2 Kings vii. 2. If any repairs were found necessary for the tabernacle erected by Moses, they
                           might be made. The ark was certainly in it till the Israelites unfortunately sent it into the camp, where it was taken by
                           the Philistines. When they sent back the ark, it was deposited at Gabaa, and not in the tabernacle, which was at Silo. Then
                           it was sent to Nobe. We find the tabernacle was at Gabaon some time after the ark was translated to Jerusalem. (Calmet) ---
                           <I>Them.</I> They might, therefore, removed the ark into the interior, and measure the country without danger. (Menochius)
                           --- The greatest part of the country had submitted to Josue. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           These seven tribes had been accustomed to live in indolence, having their food provided for them in a miraculous manner. They
                           were perhaps afraid lest, if the army of Israel should be divided, the different tribes would be too weak to make head against
                           the enemy. (Calmet) --- Josue had, however, made all things easy, and they might at their leisure conquer the few towns which
                           yet remained in the hands of the Chanaanites, if they had not cherished this indolent disposition, which was so displeasing
                           to God, and brought upon them so many evils. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           assigned to Juda or Joseph. (Challoner) --- For we must not suppose that Joseph occupied the most northern parts of the country,
                           so as, with Juda on the south, to enclose all the other tribes. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "As for you, you shall describe the
                           land into seven parts." (Calmet) --- Only the tribe of Benjamin was between these two tribes, (ver. 11,) so that Serarius
                           thinks that <I>mediam</I> has been substituted for <I>aliam,</I> "the other." (Menochius) --- <I>Lots.</I> The deputies divided
                           the country into seven portions, equal in goodness, though not in extent. After the lots were drawn, some alterations might
                           be made by common consent, and those tribes which were too much straitened for room, received what was requisite among those
                           who had too large a territory. Hence we find Joseph occupying the cities of Issachar, &amp;c., chap xvii. 10. It was equally
                           inconvenient to have too much or too little.</FONT></P><B>
