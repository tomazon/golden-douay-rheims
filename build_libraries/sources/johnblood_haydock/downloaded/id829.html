                           <i>Alleluia.</i> This word occurs at the end of the preceding psalm in Hebrew, and means, "Praise ye the Lord," though it
                           is also used as an exclamation of joy; for which reason it is left untranslated. See Apocalypse xx. (St. Augustine, ep. ad
                           Casulan.) (Calmet) --- It implies that we must praise God with all our power; and Catholic writers retain this (Worthington)
                           and similar words in the original. (Haydock) --- The first 15 verses of this psalm nearly agree with that which was composed
                           by David, when the ark was to be removed from the house of Obededon, 1 Paralipomenon xvi. 8, 22. (Haydock) --- But the last
                           part seems to have been added by him, or by another afterwards, with some small alterations. (Berthier) --- It was perhaps
                           adapted to the dedication of the second temple, with the two following psalms. (Calmet) --- <i>Gentiles.</i> Their conversion
                           is thus insinuated. (Calmet) --- The apostles preached to all. (Eusebius) --- How much more ought we not to celebrate the
                           mysteries of Christ? (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           sense also they may be styled anointed. No visible unction, but the divine appointment, might be requisite. God protected
