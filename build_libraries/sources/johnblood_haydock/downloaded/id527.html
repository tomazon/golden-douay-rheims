                           as well as those on the western side of the Jordan. (Haydock) --- <I>To it.</I> But thou shalt be translated to a better land,
                           the land of the living. Moses was now perfectly resigned to the will of God. (Salien) --- He no longer cherished those ardent
                           desires of introducing the people into Chanaan, which he had not long before expressed: as he found that God had decreed that
                           he should be deprived of the honour. He received this refusal as a just punishment of his transgression, and calmly reposed
                           in the Lord. There seems&nbsp;no reason why Moses might not have written the preceding verses at least, though the names of
                           some of the tribes are mentioned, who obtained possession only after his death. As he knew the limits of the promised land,
                           so by the prophetic spirit, he might know that these tribes would be settled in the country; and he does not mark out their
                           divisions with any degree of precision. In a word, there seems to be hardly a single passage in the Pentateuch, which may
                           not have Moses for its author. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           there.</I> This last chapter of Deuteronomy, in which the death of Moses is related, was written by Josue, or by some of the
                           prophets. (Challoner) --- Josephus ([Antiquities] iv. 9.), Philo, and Origen (contra Cels. ii. p. 95,) believe, however, that
                           Moses wrote the account of his own death. See preface to Deuteronomy. (Haydock) --- <I>Moab,</I> which had formerly belonged

                           released his soul. Some have nevertheless pretended that Moses was translated, like Elias, without dying. (Chaldean; Catharin;
                           &amp;c.) But his death and burial are too clearly mentioned in Scripture. St. Jerome (in Amos viii.) seems, at first view,
                           to countenance the former opinion: but he only speaks of a spiritual translation, and not of the body. (Calmet) --- Josephus
                           thinks that it was to prevent this mistake, that Moses wrote this chapter.</FONT></FONT></P><B>

                           satan about his body, Jude 9. Some have maintained that Josue and Eleazar performed these last rites to their deceased lawgiver.
                           (Calmet) --- But then some men would have known where he was buried. (Haydock) --- <I>Day.</I> It is pretended that Jeremias

                           it is not said in a cave. (Haydock) --- Cajetan infers from the body of Moses not being buried in the mountain, that it was

                           No prophet ever appeared with greater dignity, in the old law, than Moses. He behaved in all respects as the envoy of God,
                           who has been pleased to give his character and eulogium, Numbers xii. 6., and Ecclesiasticus xlv. 1. His miracles were most
                           astonishing, performed in the presence both of friends and of enemies, not for a short time, but for a continuance of many
                           years. (Calmet) --- But when we compare Moses with the Messias, his person and law must be regarded indeed as illustrious
                           figures, but infinitely beneath the reality. Moses was liable to failings, which caused him to be debarred from entering the
                           land of promise; and he wore a veil, to shew that his law was only the shadow of a better, and that it could bring nothing
                           to perfection. He works miracles in the name of the Lord, and with a rod: Jesus performs all <I>by</I> the word of <I>his</I>
                           own <I>power,</I> (Hebrews i. 3,) as the sovereign of the world. But though Moses must sink in a comparison with Christ, yet
                           no other personage sustained a more exalted character, or shone with greater splendour, as lawgiver, priest, prophet, ruler
                           of a great and ungovernable people, and a sacred writer of the highest antiquity. Hence the Jews almost adore him. The Mahometans
                           place him next to Jesus and their false prophet. (Haydock) --- The pagans have very probably ascribed many parts of his history
                           to their idols, Bacchus, Mercury, and Typhon; and their greatest philosophers, Pythagoras, Plato, &amp;c., have borrowed many
                           things from his writings. "What, said Numenius, is Plato, but Moses in the Attic language?" See Exodus xxxiv. 29.; Clement
                           of Alexandria, Strom. 1. and 5.; Josephus, contra Apion i.; Bochart, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- In a word, St. Gregory of Nyssa,
                           St. Ambrose, (de Cain 2,) and Philo, represent Moses as the most perfect example of a great and pious leader and legislator.
