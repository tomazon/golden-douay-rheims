                           the right of changing the established form of government, by insisting so much upon having a king at this time, we cannot
                           hence infer, as Paine and some late seditious writers have done, that the regal power is in itself an evil. It might be contrary
                           to a theocracy, and still might suit the manners of some nations better than any other form. To determine precisely what sort
                           of government is the best, would be an arduous task. We admire our own constitution; yet our ally, the prince of the Brazils,
                           has lately forbidden any panegyric of it to be printed in his dominions. All innovations are, generally, attended with the
