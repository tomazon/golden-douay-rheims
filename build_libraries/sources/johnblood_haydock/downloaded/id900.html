                           (Tirinus) --- Joram made war upon Moab, chap. iii. 5. God began to punish the house of Achab, by these means. (Calmet) ---
                           The Moabites refused to pay tribute, (Menochius) as the Israelites would not acknowledge the divine authority. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           flat in the East, and covered with earth mixed with straw, with the light at the top, to prevent the excessive heats. ---
                           <I>Of.</I> Hebrew, &amp;c., "into." (Calmet) --- If the lattices be understood to mean the rails, which were ordered to be
                           placed round the roof, (Deuteronomy xxii. 8.) Ochozias might fall into the street. (Menochius) --- Josephus thinks he fell

                           the country from being infested with flies; or the many victims offered up to him, drew those insects together. (Vatable)

                           They were perhaps citizens of Accaron, who had extolled the sagacity of their god, but were totally unacquainted with Elias.

                           how vain are the efforts of men against God and his servants, whom he has a mind to protect. (Challoner) --- The Roman laws
                           authorize a person, in authority, to punish those who refuse to obey. (Ulpin 1 D.) <I>Si quis jus dicenti non obtemperaverit,

                           upon him. (St. Thomas Aquinas, 2. 2. q. 108, a. 2.) --- The Manichees have blamed the conduct of the prophet: but the miracle
                           justifies him, as God would never countenance the private revenge of any one; and the Holy Ghost places this transaction on
                           a level with that when Elias shut up the heavens, Ecclesiasticus xlviii. 3. St. Peter was moved with the like zeal, Acts v.
                           5. The sons of Zebedee gave way to some private indignation, when they wished our Saviour to call down fire from heaven upon
                           a city of Samaria, Luke ix. 54. But he reprimanded them for it; as the citizens might not be so well acquainted with him,
                           as these soldiers must have been with Elias: and he came to display the spirit of mildness, (Calmet) to attract all to his
                           holy religion; while Elias had manifested the severity of the divine judgments, conformably to the law of terror, under which
                           he lived. (Haydock) --- In zeal of justice, Elias procured fire to burn these wicked men, as he had done for the holocaust.

                           (Menochius) --- If he were acquainted with his fate, (Haydock) this second captain was guilty of greater insolence. But there
                           are such generally to be found at courts; men who are ready to execute the king's orders, without considering whether they

                           This third captain is commonly supposed to be Abdias, (3 Kings xviii. 3.) though without much reason. (Calmet) --- John of
                           Jerus, (c. 15) says he left the court, and became a disciple of Elias, and a prophet. (Menochius) --- But he is very different
                           from the prophet, whose writings are still extant. (Calmet) --- The report of the two miracles had come to his ears, and filled
                           him with fear. (Menochius) --- <I>Despise not.</I> Hebrew, "let my life....be precious in thy sight," 1 Kings xxvi. 21., and

                           so that it is said that he reigned also <I>in the 18th year of Josaphat,</I> chap. iii. 1. See also chap. viii. 16. To obviate
                           these apparent contradictions, chronologists suppose that Joram reigned over Israel in the 18th of Josaphat, king of Juda,
                           and in the second year after the latter had appointed his son Joram viceroy. He was associated with his father on the throne
                           two years before his death, and in the 5th of Joram, king of Israel. Examples of this kind are frequent among the Hebrews,
                           and particularly among the Persians, whose chronology is thus rendered very difficult. Why should we allow that the numbers
                           are erroneous, when this explanation will suffice? (Calmet) --- Grotius leaves the matter undecided. (Du Hamel) --- Capel
                           (Crit. p. 414.) maintains that the numbers have been ill transcribed; and so does Houbigant, who asserts that such a mode
                           of writing would not be tolerated in a profane author; thus to mention different dates, without intimating how they are to
                           be reconciled. If we should read, that Heraclius began to reign "in the 18th year of Chosroes," and a little after, that he
                           ascended the throne "in the second year of the son of Chosroes," without ever specifying how Heraclius began his reign at
                           two different periods, who would not suspect a mistake? Is it not more rational to throw the blame on the transcriber, than
                           on the author? The modern chronologists seem to have invented the idea of viceroys and simultaneous kings, among the Hebrews,
                           merely to get over difficulties; though the Scripture be entirely silent on this head. Houbigant would therefore read, "in
                           the 22d year of Josaphat," as the mention of Joram seems here improper, (<I>absurda</I>) his father reigning 25 years. Ochozias
                           began to reign when Josaphat had almost completed his 17th year. See 3 Kings xxii. 52. (Haydock) --- <I>His brother</I> is
                           not specified in Hebrew, Chaldean, Arabic, and in some copies of the Septuagint, but it is in most others, as well as in the
                           Syriac, (Calmet) Josephus, &amp;c., (Haydock) and this is the common opinion. The Roman edition here inserts (Calmet) after
                           <I>Elias spoke,</I> (<B>18</B>) "And the, &amp;c....and Joram," &amp;c., nearly as chap. iii. 1, 2, 3; only for <I>father,</I>
                           it substitutes, "not like his brothers;" and adds, "the wrath of the Lord was enkindled against the house of Achab." No mention
                           is made of the second year of Joram, &amp;c., (Haydock) in any edition of the Septuagint. (Capel) --- In the mean time Josaphat,
                           being returned from the unfortunate expedition with Achab, set his kingdom in order, purifying it from all the vestiges of
                           idolatry, as much as he was able, and appointing proper judges, 2 Paralipomenon xix.</FONT></P><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>
