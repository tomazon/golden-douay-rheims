                           We are accountable for the sins of others, to which we are accessory, as appears from this and part of the following chapter.
                           No distinction of persons is here noticed. If any one, therefore, be witness to another's promise, confirmed by oath, and,
                           being cited to the bar, refuse to speak, he shall be guilty of sin, and offer the sacrifice proscribed (ver. 6,) for all the
                           preceding cases. Restitution must also be made to the injured person. (Menochius) --- But others suppose that no sacrifice
                           was allowed for such an obstinate wretch as when not answered when the judge <I>swore</I> or adjured him. He was liable to
                           be put to death. The associate of the thief fell under the like punishment as the thief himself, when he would not reveal
                           the theft to the judge, Proverbs xxix. 24. Others again understand this <I>swearing</I> to mean blaspheming God. If the hearer
                           do not reprehend him, he shall suffer as his accomplice. (Origen; Philo) --- Junius thinks that the neglect of fraternal correction,
                           was to be expiated by the sacrifice prescribed for the sins of ignorance, concerning which Moses is treating. But it seems
                           that the person here mentioned was to die, as the words <I>he shall bear his iniquity,</I> commonly denote, chap. xix. 8.;
                           &amp;c. (Calmet) --- When perjury prejudiceth another's cause, we are bound to reveal what we know to the judge, if it can
                           be done so as to avoid scandal. (Worthington) --- <I>Not.</I> Hebrew editions read <I>loa,</I> instead of <I>la,</I> both
                           here and in 34 other places; an irregularity unknown in some manuscripts, and to the Samaritan copy. Perhaps it may have been
                           occasioned by <I>lu,</I> "to him," being of the same sound with <I>la.</I> (Kennicott)</FONT></P>

                           All wild beasts were deemed unclean; but domestic clean cattle, though slain, did not defile; (Calmet) while some of the unclean
                           did, even alive, chap. xi. 26, 31. (Haydock) --- Fishes are comprised under the name of <I>reptiles;</I> yet some were not
                           unclean, chap. xi. 9. The Septuagint neglect <I>reptiles,</I> and put "the carcasses of impure abominations;" by which they
                           probably mean dogs, and such things as the Egyptians adored. This verse does not regard those who had only touched something
                           unclean, as such were to be purified at night, by washing their garments; but it refers to those who, having neglected that
                           ordinance, had still ventured to touch something sacred, and were therefore required to offer the sacrifice, <I>assom,</I>
                           (Calmet) as for an irreligious behaviour towards God. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           either such as he may choose, (St. Augustine, q. 2.) or such as the priest may require. (Lyranus) (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           This is necessary before he can be punished by men; but every secret promise binds before God. (Tostat) --- <I>Evil or good:</I>
                           any thing whatsoever, whether favour or punishment, whether the completion of it be difficult or easy. (Calmet) --- Thus parents
                           sometimes foolishly swear that they will chastise their children unmercifully; libertines that they will live in luxuries
                           as long as they have any money; ill-natured people that they will never speak to such a one, that they will murder, &amp;c.
                           To execute such promises, even confirmed by an oath, would be a double crime. Let them ask pardon of God for their rash oath.
                           (Philo) --- Herod made his oath a pretext for killing John the Baptist, deluding himself, perhaps, with a false interpretation
                           of this law. (Haydock) --- As such hasty oaths are easily forgotten, when the guilty person recollected himself, he was bound
                           to confess his fault to the priest in the following manner, according to the Rabbins: Placing his hands between the horns
                           of his victim, he shall say, "I beseech you, Lord, I have sinned; I have committed iniquity and prevarication; I have committed
                           such a fault. I repent, I am filled with sorrow and confusion for having done so; I will relapse no more." These doctors teach,
                           that without confession and sorrow no sacrifice will remit sin. (Calmet) --- To preserve the <I>secret</I> of confession,
                           the priests were ordered to eat the victims <I>alone.</I> (Philo, &amp;c.) (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           read in the dual number, whereas the Hebrew pointed copies have sicles indefinitely; and the Rabbins understand two, when
                           the word is plural and undetermined. Theodoret reads fifty, which some maintain is the ancient translation of the Septuagint,
                           though it is not found in any of our copies. Hebrew may be rendered "a ram (or) according to thy estimation, sicles of silver."
                           The particle <I>or</I> is sometimes understood. It is probable that when the fault was considerable, a ram was to be sacrificed,
                           and restitution made of what was due with the fifth part besides; but if the fault was small, the priest determined how many
                           sicles were to be presented for sacred purposes. --- <I>Sanctuary.</I> See Exodus xxx. 13.</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew, "It is a victim for the sin which he has committed against the Lord." From this chapter, as well as from Numbers v.
                           7, it is obvious that a special confession was necessary, not only for those who had fallen into the disorder of leprosy,
                           which was a figure of sin, and often inflicted by God in punishment of it; but also, when they had given way to the smallest
                           transgression against the commands and ceremonies of the Lord. (Haydock) --- This custom is still observed by the Jews. (Galatinus
