                           Asa. (Challoner) --- They had been built before the temple, and tolerated by the prophets; (Calmet) and, though they were
                           now improper for sacrifices, (Haydock) Asa thought it would be imprudent to molest them, (Calmet) as perhaps he could not
                           take them away. (Du Hamel) --- He left also the ruins of (Haydock) the temples built by Solomon, (Worthington) on Mount Olivet,
                           (4 Kings xxiii.; Menochius) as no longer dangerous. (Salien) --- <I>Lord.</I> Asa had his faults; but never forsook the worship
                           of the Lord. (Challoner) --- In the same sense, David is so often praised as a just prince. Asa threw a prophet into prison,
                           and placed his trust as much in physicians, &amp;c., 2 Paralipomenon xvi. 10, 12. But he did penance, and deserves to be ranked
