                           After having answered the questions of St. Peter, Jesus again addresses himself to his disciples, and bids them not to be
                           afflicted or troubled, at what he says to them. Many Greeks and Latins begin this chapter thus: <i>Jesus said to his disciples,
                           let not your hearts be troubled.</i> (St. Chrysostom) --- Euthymius; Leont.; Theophylactus; Theodor.; &amp;c. agree, that
                           our Saviour wished to encourage his apostles, who were so much troubled, because he had said, that Peter should deny him.
                           They thought within themselves, if Peter, who is the strongest, and most resolute amongst us, shall so far forget himself,
                           as to deny his master, what will become of us? Jesus seeing their anxiety, tells them not to be troubled; but to believe in
                           him, and in his words, for he had said, that he would not lose any, whom his Father had given him; (John chap. vi, ver. 39.)
                           and that whosoever should believe in him, should have life everlasting. (chap. iii, ver. 15.) --- <i>Let not your heart be
                           troubled.</i> Christ here begins those incomparable discourses to his apostles, which are set down in the four next chapters.
                           His sufferings and death now approaching, he forewarns them <i>not to be troubled.</i> You believe in God, and put your trust
                           in him; <i>believe also,</i> and trust <i>in me,</i> no less than in him. (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           <i>In my Father's house.</i> He does not say of your Father: for though God be the Father of all by creation, and of the just,
                           by the grace of adoption; yet Christ in several places, calls him his Father, in a quite different sense, that is, as he was
                           his eternal Father, as the ancient interpreters observe. (Witham) --- These <i>many mansions</i> signify different degrees

                           nature, am one and the same with the Father: so that he who believes, and as it were sees, or knows by faith, who I am, cannot
                           but know, that I am one with my eternal Father; not one person, as the Sabellians fancied, but one in nature and substance.
                           The ancient Fathers take notice against the Arians, that these words, and others that follow in this chapter, could not be
                           true, if Christ was no more than a creature, though ever so perfect, there being an infinite distance betwixt God and the
                           highest of his creatures. (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?</i> These words confirm the equality of the Father and
                           the Son: nor can they be expounded of an union of <i>affection</i> only, by what Christ told them before. (John v. 17. and
                           19.) <i>As the Father worketh till now, so I work:</i> and <i>whatsoever things the Father worketh, these also in like manner
                           the Son doth.</i> (Witham) --- In the Son and in the Father, there is one and the same essence, the same wisdom, the same
                           power; so that what the Son says, he does not say it of himself, and what the Son does, he does not do it of himself; but
                           it is the Father, who abideth in the Son, who both acts and speaks.</font></p><b>

                           <i>And greater than these shall he do, because I go to the Father.</i> Christ speaks of the greatness of visible miracles,
                           and tells them, that after his ascension, they shall be enabled, even to do greater miracles than he has yet shewn to the
                           world. He would give this power to his disciples, who were to convert the world; and perhaps the greatest miracle of all,
                           was the conversion of the whole world. (Witham) --- Behold another proof of my divinity, viz. the wonderful miracles those
                           perform, who believe in me. An impostor may seduce the vulgar with false miracles, or, perhaps, with real wonderful prodigies;
                           but he cannot confer that power on others. Behold, I have performed miracles by my own power, without any deceit, and always
                           with a sovereign authority. I have given those, who believed in me, power to work in my name, as great, and even greater miracles,
                           than I have done myself. All this I have done, to shew you, that I am equally God with the Father. I truly am so, then, for
                           it would be impossible for God to assist an impostor, a liar, and an enemy to his honour and glory. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           of the apostles, but also to their successors, through all generations. (Challoner) --- I have not changed the word <i>Paraclete,</i>
                           which signifies, both and advocate and a comforter.<i> He shall remain with you, </i>and <i>in you, for ever.</i> What greater

                           Ghost had been promised only to the apostles, their successors could not have challenged the promise. But the promises and
                           privileges were not merely personal, but attached to their office perpetually. Hence, the Holy Ghost, in every age and clime,

                           and of the words, (chap. xvii. ver. 21.) when Christ prays, that his disciples <i>may be one, as he and his Father are one,</i>
                           which words imply no more than a similitude, and an imitation of that union of love (with which the three divine persons love
                           one another) though at an infinite distance. If the old or new Arians examined, with a sincere desire of finding the truth
                           (which they ought to seek from many passages in the New Testament, as well as from the sense and tradition of the Church,
                           guided by the promised Spirit of Truth) they might certainly find how different is the union of nature and substance of the
                           eternal Son with his eternal Father, and of that union of the three divine persons, when they are said to be one, from that
                           inferior and lesser union of love and affection, by which either God loves his adoptive children, his faithful servants, or
                           they love one another: they would easily discover, that many things are said of the unity and union of the divine persons,
                           which could not be true, unless they were one and the same God, <i>coeternal</i> and <i>consubstantial,</i> which by no means
                           can be said of God and his creatures, nor of the union of affection only, by which the creatures love one another. (Witham)</font></p><b>

                           the comparison between the actions of our Saviour, and the figures of the old law: but no sooner had the Holy Ghost descended
                           upon them, than they explained the Scriptures, their hearts and eyes being opened and enlightened by the light of the Holy
                           Spirit. (Calmet) --- See chap. xvi. ver. 12. and 13.</font></p><b>

                           <i>The Father is greater than I.</i>[3] According to the common exposition, Christ here speaks of himself, as made man, which
                           interpretation is drawn from the circumstances of the text, Christ being at that time, going to suffer, and die, and shortly
                           after to rise again, and ascend into heaven, all which agree with him, as man, and according to his human nature. But the
                           Arians can take no advantage from these words, (though with divers of the ancient Fathers, we should allow them to be spoken
                           of Christ, as the Son of God:) the Father may be said in some manner to be greater than the Son, if we consider the order
                           of the divine processions, that is, that the Father is the first person, and proceeds from no other; whereas the Son proceeds
                           from the Father. If any one, says St. Chrysostom, will contend, that the Father is greater, inasmuch as he is the cause, from
                           which the Son proceedeth, we will bear with him, and this way of speaking: provided he grant that the Son is <i>not of a different
                           substance,</i> or nature. St. Athanasius allows the same, and takes notice, that though the Father is said to be greater,
                           yet he is not said to be better, nor more excellent, than the Son; because they are one and the same in substance, nature,
                           and other perfections. (Witham) --- The enemies of the divinity of Christ here triumph, and think they have the confession
                           of Christ himself, that he is less than the Father. But if they would distinguish the two natures of Christ, their arguments
                           would all fall to the ground. Jesus Christ, as man, and a creature, is inferior to his Father, the Creator; but, as God, he
                           is, in every respect, equal to him. (St. Basil, St. Augustine, &amp;c.) --- Others, likewise, answer it thus: Following the
                           confused opinion of the world, and even of the apostles themselves, who as yet only considered Christ as a prophet, and as
                           a man, eminent in virtue and sanctity, he was less than the Father. (St. Chrysostom; Leont.; Theophylactus; Euthymius) ---
                           And likewise the title of Father, (as we generally use the word) is greater, and much more honourable, than that of Son; and
                           in this respect, Christ is inferior to his Father. (St. Athanasius; St. Hilary; St. Epiphanius; St. Gregory of Nazianzus;
                           and St. Cyril) ---But this appellation, though really true, does not destroy the equality of the persons, because Christ has
                           declared, in numerous other places, that he is equal to the Father; that he is in the Father; and that he and the Father are
                           one. The apostles ought to have rejoiced that Christ was going to the Father, who was superior to him, considering him in
                           his human nature; because, then, would the Son shew forth his honour and glory to be equal to the Father's, in heaven. This
                           would have been a mark of a pure, solid, and disinterested love, which ought to have inspired the apostles, if they truly
                           loved their divine Master. (Calmet) --- Protestants assume to themselves the liberty of making the Bible only, the exclusive
                           rule of faith, yet refuse this privilege to others. Thus Luther insisted, that his catechism should be taught, and followed.
                           Calvin burnt Servetus for explaining his faith, by his own interpretation of the Bible, particularly of these words, <i>the
                           Father is greater than I.</i> The Church of England compels every clergyman to swear to the Thirty-nine Articles, and has
                           inflicted the severest penalties on such as interpreted the Bible according to the principles of Socinus; and on Catholics,
                           who understand the words of Jesus Christ, <i>This is my body: this is my blood,</i> in the literal and obvious sense of the
                           words. As long as each individual is at liberty to expound Scripture by the private spirit, it is a great injustice to compel
                           any one, by penal laws, to yield his judgment to any authority, that is not less fallible than his own.</font></p><b>

                           Yet by chap. xviii. ver. 1. Christ still continued the like instructions, either in the same place, or in the way to Gethsemani.
