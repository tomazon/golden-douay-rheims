                           John gives here Peter's first denial, which is reunited to the other two by all the preceding evangelists. This is one of
                           the circumstances, which the others may have neglected, to unite three similar facts, and relating to the same object. (Bible
                           de Vence) --- St. Peter, the prince and head of the Church, was permitted to fall, to teach him to treat with more mildness
                           and condescension those, whom he would afterwards have to raise out of the same miserable state of sin. One weak and frail
                           man is placed over another, that seeing him unhappily fallen, he may give him his kind and helping hand, to free him from
                           that unhappy state, in which he knows himself to have been. (St. Chrysostom) --- Of all which our divine Saviour suffered
                           in the court of Caiphas, nothing so much affected him as the dangerous fall of Peter, the chief of all his apostles, who had
                           received the most signal favours from him. He had boasted that very night, that although all the rest of the disciples should
                           abandon their master, he would never forsake him. Yet, see the weakness and inconstancy of human nature; at the voice of a
                           poor maid, he forthwith denies his master; repeats his denial a second, and a third time, and even swears with an imprecation,
                           that he never knew the man. O what is man, when he confides too much in himself! Let us look to ourselves, and see, that we
                           never fall into the same unfortunate state. But if we have the misfortune to imitate this apostle in his fall, let us likewise
                           imitate him in his speedy repentance: for immediately after his fall, going out, he wept bitterly; a practice which, it is
                           said, he ever after retained, as often as he heard the cock crow. (Butler's Lives of the Saints)</FONT></P><B>

                           words, that the Scribes and Pharisees at least, had deferred eating the paschal-lamb, till Friday the 15th day, in the evening:
                           but there are passages in the Scripture, which shew, that the word <I>Pasch,</I> or Phase, comprehended not only the paschal
                           sacrifice of the lamb, but also the sacrifices, that were to be eaten with unleavened bread, during the seven days of the
                           paschal solemnity, as Deuteronomy xvi. 2. <I>thou shalt offer up the Phase,</I> or Pasch, <I>to the Lord, of sheep and oxen.</I>
                           And 1 Paralipomenon xxxv. 8. <I>They gave to the priests to make the Phase,</I> or Pasch,<I> in altogether two thousand six
                           hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</I> The oxen, therefore, were also given, to make up the Pasch, and were comprehended
                           by the word Pasch, or Phase. It might, therefore, be these paschal sacrifices, and not the paschal-lamb, which the priests
                           designed to partake of, and therefore would not enter into the palace of Pilate. See Tillemont against Lamy, on the 2nd passage

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 But Peter stood at the door without. *Then the other disciple, who

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world: I have always

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 Why asketh thou me? ask them who have heard what I have spoken to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And when he had said these things, one of the officers standing by,
                                    gave Jesus a blow, saying; Answerest thou the high priest so?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Jesus answered him; If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 Then Peter again denied: and immediately the cock crew.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 They answered, and said to him; If he were not a malefactor, we would

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 Jesus answered; My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 Pilate, therefore, said to him; Art thou a king then? Jesus answered;
