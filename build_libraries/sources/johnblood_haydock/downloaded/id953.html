                           Salien) as the law was written. (Haydock) --- The Jews pretend that this plan was delivered to Moses, and handed down by Josue,

                           a treasure, being derived from the Persian, Gaza. David gave, therefore, a description of the rooms to keep the treasures
                           of the temple, or of the cellars for wine and oil. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "a pattern of the temple and of the houses thereof,

                           --- The change of <i>i</i> for <i>u</i> was very easy; and perhaps the basins were ornamented with representations of lions.
                           (Du Hamel) (Menochius) --- We do not find <i>cephor</i> used before, to denote any of the vessels of the tabernacle: but Esdras
                           uses it, (chap. viii. 27.) whence it is inferred that it is of Chaldean extraction.</font></p><b>
