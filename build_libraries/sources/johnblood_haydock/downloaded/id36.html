                           might have arisen from another cause besides the precedence given by Jesus Christ to Peter above, as St. Chrysostom (hom.
                           lix. in Mat.) affirms. A report prevailed among the disciples, that Christ would soon die; and they wished to know who would
                           be the first, when he was gone. (Jansenius) --- Or expecting that by his future resurrection he would enter into full possession
                           of his temporal kingdom, they wished to learn which of them should be the greater in this new and glorious state. Calmet supposes
                           that Peter was not with them, but that he had gone before with his Master to Capharnaum. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           (Witham) --- Considering the wickedness and corruption of the world, such things always will happen; but the judgments of
                           God, though slow, will be terrible in the extreme. Lento quidem gradu Divina procedit Vindicta, sed tarditatem gravitate compensat.
                           (Val. Max.) --- We must not suppose for a moment that Christ subjects human actions to the control of rigid fatality. It is
                           not the prescience or prediction of Christ, which causes these evils to take place; they do not happen, because Christ foretold
                           them; but, Christ foretold them, because they would infallibly happen. The Almighty permits scandals, because the good are
                           benefited by them, making them more diligent and more watchful: witness the great virtue of Job, of Joseph, and many others
                           perfected in temptation. If the less virtuous receive any detriment from scandals, they owe it to their own sloth and laziness.
                           (St. Chrysostom, hom. lx.) --- Jesus Christ pronounces a double wo to the man who bringeth scandal, and to the world which
                           is punished by it. But why, asks St. Chrysostom does he bewail the miseries of the world, when it depended upon him to stretch
                           forth his hand and remove them? He imitates the conduct of a good physician, who, after prescribing various remedies, feels
                           himself obliged to declare to his patient, that by neglecting the prescriptions, he is increasing his distemper. Jesus Christ
                           had left the throne of his glory, taken upon him the form of a servant, and suffered the greatest extremities, but seeing
                           man so perverse as to reap no advantage from all he had done and suffered for him, he weeps over his miserable state. Nor
                           is this without its particular fruit; for it frequently happens, that whom good counsel cannot move, prayers and tears, and
                           the relation of the dismal consequences attendant on sin, bring to repentance. This also manifests his tenderness and boundless
                           charity, since he weeps over the people, who of all others most contradicted him. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lx.)</FONT></P><B>

                           dear to us, sooner than remain in the occasions of offending God. (Witham) --- These words more properly mean our relatives
                           and friends, who are united to us as closely as the different members of the body. This he had touched upon before, yet he
                           again repeats it, for nothing is so pernicious, nothing so dangerous, as the company and conversation of the dissolute. Connections
                           of friendship and affinity, are sometimes more powerful in inclining us to good or evil, than open compulsion. On this account
                           Christ, with great earnestness, commands us to cut with those most near and dear to us, when they are to us the immediate
                           occasions of scandal. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lx.)</FONT></P><B>

                           angels.</I> The Jews also believed that men had their good angels, or angels appointed to be their guardians. See Genesis
                           xlviii. 16. (Witham) --- Observe the dignity of the humble and little, whom the world despises. They have angels constantly
                           pleading their cause in the divine presence. They are now weak and unable to defend themselves, but they have their advocates
                           in heaven, accusing those who offer them any injury or scandal. It is evident from many parts of Scripture, that angels are
                           appointed guardians of kingdoms, countries, cities, and even individuals, Exodus xxiii. Daniel x. Apocalypse xii. &amp; alibi.
                           <I>The angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear him, and he shall deliver them.</I> (Psalm xxxiii.) St. Jerome
                           does not hesitate to affirm that every man has an angel assigned him at his birth, which he confirms from Chap. xii, of Acts,
                           where it is related that the girl thought she saw Peter's angel. The thing is so plain, that Calvin, dares not deny it, and
                           yet he will needs doubt of it. (Lib. i. Inst. chap. xiv. sect. 7.) Origen thinks that only the just have their guardian angels,
                           and these only at their baptism. The opinion of St. Augustine is universal in the Catholic Church. "I esteem it, O my God,
                           an inestimable benefit, that thou hast granted me an angel to guide me from the moment of my birth, to my death." (De dilig.
                           Deo. Medit. chap. xii.) How much are we indebted to the Providence of God, for extending itself also to the wicked. They likewise
                           have their angels, without whose assistance they would fall into many more grievous sins, and the evil spirits would have
                           more power over them. Let us then with gratitude remember our dignity, and fear to commit any thing in their presence, which
                           may make them grieve and withdraw from us their protection and assistance.</FONT></P><B>

                           and solicitude for us poor weak creatures, by becoming himself the Son of man, thus abandoning in some measure the angels

                           is therefore sometimes frustrated in its effects, which is contrary to Scripture. To this objection, St. John Damascene replies,

                           a thing <I>antecedently,</I> when he wills it merely as considered in itself. For instance, a prince wishes his subjects to
                           live, in as much as they are all his subjects. But a person wills a thing <I>consequently,</I> when he will a thing in consideration
                           of some particular circumstance. Thus, though the king wishes all his subject to live, he nevertheless wills that some should
                           die, if they turn traitors, or disorganize the peace of society. In the same manner, the Almighty wishes none of his little
                           ones to perish, in as much as they are all his creatures, made to his own image, and destined for the kingdom of glory; though
                           it is equally certain that he wills the eternal punishment of many who have turned away from his service, and followed iniquity.
                           If we observe this distinction, it is easy to see what our Saviour meant, when he said that it was not the will of his Father
                           that any of these little ones should perish. (St. John Damascene)</FONT></P><B>

                           go and admonish his brother. Other understand <I>against thee,</I> to mean in thy presence, or to thy knowledge, because fraternal
                           correction is a duty, not only when our brother offends us, but likewise when he offends against his neighbour, and much more
                           when he offends God. It is moreover a duty not peculiar to the injured, but common to all. When the offence is not personal,
                           our advice will be less interested. This precept, though positive, is only obligatory, when it is likely to profit your brother,
                           as charity is the only motive for observing it. Therefore, it not only may, but ought to be omitted, when the contrary effect
                           is likely to ensue, whether it be owing to the perversity of the sinner, or the circumstances of the admonisher. (Jansenius)</FONT></P><B>

                           Peter knew the Jews to be much given to revenge; he therefore thought it a great proof of superior virtue to be able to forgive
                           seven times. It was for this reason he proposed this question to our Lord; who, to shew how much he esteemed charity, immediately
                           answered, not only seven times, but seventy times seven times. He does not mean to say that this number must be the bounds
                           of our forgiving; we must forgive to the end, and never take revenge, however often our brother offend against us. There must
                           be no end of forgiving poor culprits that sincerely repent, either in the sacrament of penance, or one man another his offences.

                           bids the sun to shine upon the good and the bad. But if the thought of having to imitate God alarm us, though it should not
                           seem difficult to a true lover of God, let us place before our eyes the examples of his favourite servants. Let us imitate
                           Joseph, who though reduced to a state of the most abject servitude, by the hatred of his unnatural brethren, yet in the affliction
                           of his heart, employed all his power to succour them in their afflictions. Let us imitate Moses, who after a thousand injuries,
                           raised his fervent supplications in behalf of his people. Let us imitate the blessed Paul, who, though daily suffering a thousand
                           afflictions from the Jews, still wished to become an anathema for their salvation. Let us imitate Stephen, who, when the stones
                           of his persecutors were covering him with wounds, prayed that the Almighty would pardon their sin. Let us follow these admirable
                           examples, then shall we extinguish the flames of anger, then will our heavenly Father grant us the forgiveness of our sins,
                           through the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxii.)</FONT></P><B>

                           to have punished the servant for it. God doth not in this manner with us. But we may here observe, once for all, that in parables,
                           diverse things are only ornamental to the parable itself; and a caution and restriction is to be used in applying them. (Witham)
                           --- Not that God will revoke a pardon once granted; for this would be contrary to his infinite mercy, and his works are without
                           repentance. It means that God will not pardon, or rather that he will severely punish the ingratitude and inhumanity of the
                           man, who, after having received from God the most liberal pardon of his grievous transgressions, refuses to forgive the slightest
                           offence committed against him by his neighbour, who is a member, nay a son of his God. This ingratitude may justly be compared
                           with the 10,000 talents, as every grievous offence committed against God, exceeds, in an infinite degree, any offence against
                           man. (Tirinus) --- This forgiveness must be real, not pretended; from the heart, and not in word and appearance only; sacrificing
                           all desire of revenge, all anger, hatred and resentment, at the shrine of charity.</FONT></P>
