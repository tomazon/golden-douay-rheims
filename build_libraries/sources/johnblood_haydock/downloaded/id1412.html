                           He falsely asserted that he was the son of Epiphanes, being of very mean birth. (Just. xxxv.) (Worthington) --- Others say
                           that he was illegitimate, and styled Ballas after his mother Bala, though the name in Syriac may denote "a worthless person."

                           "beneficent." (Calmet) (Usher, the year [of the world] 3851.) --- At any rate the Romans and Egyptians acknowledged him, being
                           glad to find a rival for Demetrius, who was become odious likewise to the Jews and Syrians. Heraclides had been deprived of
                           his government (Calmet) by the king, (chap. vii. 8.) and in revenge (Haydock) took Alexander, and Laodicea, daughter of Epiphanes,
                           to Rome, where he gained over many of the senators, who agreed to help them to recover the kingdom. Heraclides then levied
                           forces at Ephesus, and Ptolemais was delivered up to Alexander, whence he wrote to Jonathan. Nothing contributed more than
                           these divisions to secure the liberty of the Jews.</FONT></P><B>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">55 And king Ptolemee answered, saying: <b>Happy </b>is the day wherein

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">61 And some pestilent men of Israel, men of a wicked life, assembled

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">62 And he commanded that Jonathan's garments should be taken off, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">63 And he said to his princes: Go out with him into the midst of the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">64 So when his accusers saw his glory proclaimed, and him clothed with

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">65 And the king magnified him, and enrolled him amongst his chief friends,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">74 Now when Jonathan heard the words of Apollonius, he was moved in his

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">75 And they pitched their tents near Joppe, but they shut him out of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">76 And they that were in the city being affrighted, opened the gates

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">77 And Apollonius heard of it, and he took three thousand horsemen, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">78 And he went to Azotus, as one that was making a journey, and immediately

                                    him to Azotus, and they joined battle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">79 And Apollonius left privately in the camp a thousand horsemen behind

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">81 But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them: and so

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">82 Then Simon drew forth his army, and attacked the legion: for the horsemen
                                    were wearied: and they were discomfited by him, and fled.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">83 And they that were scattered about the plain, fled into Azotus, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">84 But Jonathan set fire to Azotus, and the cities that were around it,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">86 And Jonathan removed his army from thence, and camped against Ascalon:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">87 And Jonathan returned into Jerusalem with his people, having many

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">89 And he sent him a buckle of gold, as the custom is, to be given to
