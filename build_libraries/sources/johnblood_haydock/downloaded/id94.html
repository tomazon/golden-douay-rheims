                           in open day, when the enemies of Christ could see him. For many (as this evangelist informs us in chap. xii. ver. 42,) of
                           the chief men also believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess, that they might not be cast out of
                           the Synagogue. (St. Chrysostom) --- It appears from this verse that Jesus Christ wrought many miracles, even in the first
                           year of his preaching: though not very publicly, and amidst the crowd. However, few of those which he performed in Judea are

                           the Virgin Mary, against the Cerinthians, &amp;c. That he <I>descended</I> from heaven: that when he was made man, and conversed
                           with men on earth, he was at the same time in heaven. Some Socinians give us here their groundless fancy, that Jesus after
                           his baptism took a journey to heaven, and returned again before his death. Nor yet would this make him <I>in heaven,</I> when

                           The divinity of the Son is in this chapter proved as clearly as in 1 John v. 7. "There are three who give testimony in heaven;
                           the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one." Which verse is entirely omitted by Luther in his version;
                           for which omission he is severely reproved by Keckerman. But while Catholics and Protestants deduce from this and many other
                           places in Scripture, the divinity of Jesus Christ, as an indubitable and irrefragable consequence, how may learned Arians,
                           Socinians, and Unitarians read the same texts, and deduce quite contrary consequences? How clearly does this prove that the
                           <I>Bible only</I> cannot prove the exclusive rule of faith. With reason does the Cambridge divinity professor, Dr. Herbert
                           Marsh, ask in his late publication on this subject, p. 18, "Are all Protestants alike in their religion? Have we not got Protestants
                           of the Church of England, Protestants of the Church of Scotland, Protestants who hold the profession of Augsburgh? Have we
                           not both Arminian and Calvinistic Protestants? Are not the Moravians, the Methodists, the Baptists, the Quakers, and even
                           the Jumpers, the Dunkers, the Swedenborgians, all Protestants? Since, then Protestantism assumes so many different forms,
                           men speak quite <I>indefinitely,</I> if they speak of it without explaining the particular kind which they mean. When I hear
                           of a Swedish or a Danish Protestant, I know that it means a person whose religion is the <I>Bible only,</I> as expounded by
                           the <I>Synod of Dort.</I> In like manner a Protestant of the Church of England, is a person whose religion is the <I>Bible
                           only;</I> but the Bible as expounded by its <I>Liturgy</I> and <I>Articles.</I> How, therefore, can we know, if we give the
                           <I>Bible only</I>, what sort of Protestantism well be deduced from it?" --- In the same publication, Dr. Herbert Marsh, p.
                           21, adds, "Protestants of <I>every</I> description, however various and even opposite in their opinions, claim severally for
                           themselves the honour of deducing from the Bible irrefragable and indubitable consequences. The doctrine of conditional salvation
                           is an indubitable consequence to the Arminian. The doctrine of absolute decree, an indubitable consequence to the Calvinist.
                           The doctrines of the trinity, the atonement and the sacraments, which the Church of England considers as indubitable consequences
                           of the Bible, would not be so, if the Unitarians and Quakers were right in the consequences which they draw from the Bible.
                           But the consequences which they deduce appear indubitable to them." This the professor properly styles protestantism in the
                           abstract, or generalized, and nearly allied to apostacy from Christianity: a system, p. 16, "by which many a pilgrim has lost
                           his way between the portal of the temple and the altar---disdaining the gate belonging only to the priests, and approaching
                           at once the portals of the&nbsp;temple, they have ventured without a clue, to explore the inmost recesses; and have been bewildered
                           in their way, till at length they have wandered to the devious passage, where Christianity itself becomes lost from the view."
