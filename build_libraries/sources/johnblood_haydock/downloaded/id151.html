                           as <I>he,</I> the man, liveth. For St. Paul here compares the law (which in the Greek is in the masculine gender) to a husband,
                           whom a wife cannot quit, nor be married to another, as long as the husband liveth, without being an adulteress: but if the
                           <I>husband be dead,</I> (as the law of Moses is now dead, and no longer obligatory after the publishing of the new law of
                           Christ) the people that were Jews, and under the Jewish law, are now free from that former husband, to wit, the written law
                           of Moses. Nay, this people also are <I>become dead to the law,</I> (ver. 4.) because the law itself is dead <I>by the body
                           of Christ,</I> or, as in the Greek, by reason of the body of Christ offered and sacrificed for you, and for all on the cross:
                           so that now you must look upon yourselves as spiritually married to him: which agrees with what follows, <I>that you may belong

                           does not say, as St. Chrysostom observes, that they were <I>caused</I> by the law, but only <I>were by it,</I> meaning that

                           asleep before, was awakened by the prohibition; the law not being the cause thereof, nor properly <I>giving occasion</I> to
                           it: but <I>occasion being taken</I> by our corrupt nature to resist the commandment laid upon us. (Challoner) --- <I>Sin.</I>
                           The apostle here calls concupiscence by the name of sin; because it is the consequence and punishment of it, and drags us
                           along to sin. This takes occasion from the precept of the law to induce us to transgress it; for we are naturally inclined
                           to do what is forbidden. --- <I>Nitimur in vetitum</I> --- which is the offspring of a disorderly love of liberty and independence.
                           Without the law sin was dead, because concupiscence had nothing to rouse and trouble it. It was like a torrent which rolled
                           rapidly, without resistance in its channel, but as soon as the law came and put an obstacle, it began to spread itself far
                           and wide, and commit the strangest ravages. Or it may be explained thus: without the law sin was dead; not being known to
                           the world, and not imputed to us as a transgression. He speaks here of the transgressions of the written law, not of the law
                           of nature, of which each one has a sufficient knowledge to render him inexcusable, whenever he transgresses it. (Calmet) ---
                           <I>Without the law sin was dead;</I> that is, many sins were so little known, that before the written law they seemed no sins;
                           not but that, at all times, reason and conscience shewed many things to be sinful and ill done, so that whosoever acted against
                           these lights could not be excused. See what St. Paul says of the heathen philosophers, chap. i. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>I lived some time without the law;</I> i.e. without the knowledge of the law. This some understand of&nbsp;St. Paul in
                           the time of his childhood, before he came to the knowledge of what was forbidden by any law. But the exposition, which agrees
                           with the rest of this chapter, is this; that St. Paul, though he seems to speak of himself, yet represents the condition of
                           any person that lived before the written law was given: <I>but when the commandment came,</I> after that the written law was
                           given, and its precepts came to my knowledge, <I>then sin revived,</I> by giving me a perfect knowledge: and by transgressing
                           those precepts, I became more guilty and without excuse. --- <I>I died:</I> i.e. became guilty by transgression of the known
                           law, and guilty of eternal death: <I>and the commandments</I> or precepts, <I>which were unto life,</I> which were good in
                           themselves, and designed to direct me what I was to do, and what I was to avoid in order to obtain eternal life, <I>were found
                           to be unto death to me,</I> but by my own fault; and <I>occasionally</I> only, from the <I>commandments</I> of the law and
                           the knowledge of them, when with full knowledge I transgressed them. Thus I was <I>seduced</I> by sin, which with it brought
                           death, though the law and the commandment (ver. 12) were in themselves <I>holy, and</I> just,<I> and good.</I> They could
                           not but be good, as St. Chrysostom says, their author being the true God, and not any evil principle or cause, that was the
                           author of evils, as the impious Manicheans pretended. We might as well, says St. Chrysostom, find fault with the tree of life
                           [the tree of knowledge of good and evil?] and the forbidden fruit in Paradise, which was not the cause, but only the occasion
                           of our misery, when Adam eat of it. It cannot then be said, <I>that that which was good,</I> (to wit, the <I>law </I>) <I>was
                           made death to me,</I> or the cause of my death; but <I>sin,</I> and my unresisted sinful inclinations, <I>that it might appear
                           sin,</I> or that it might evidently appear how great an evil sin is,<I> by that which is good,</I> (i.e. by the transgression
                           of the <SPAN lang=EN>law which is good) <I>wrought</I> and brought <I>death to me,</I> that by the <I>occasion</I> of the
                           precepts&nbsp;</SPAN>given and known, <I>sin might become sinful above measure.</I> He speaks of sin as it were of a certain
                           person; and the sense is, that sin, which was in my corrupt nature, might <I>become sinful above measure,</I> when it led
                           me into all manner of disorders and excess, which I yielded to. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           to by our free-will. There has been a great dispute both among the ancient and later interpreters, whether St. Paul from this
                           verse to the end of the chapter speaks of a person remaining in sin, either under the law of nature or of the written law,
                           (which was once the opinion of St. Augustine) or whether he speaks of a person regenerated by baptism, and in the state of
                           grace in the new law, and even of himself when he was a faithful servant of God. This is the opinion of St. Augustine in many
                           of his later writings against the Pelagians, for which he also cites St. Hilary, St. Gregory of Nazianzus, and St. Ambrose.
                           It is also the opinion of St. Jerome, (Ep. ad Eustochium de custod. Virg.) of St. Gregory the great, of Ven. Bede, and the
                           more approved opinion, according to which the apostle here by sin does not understand that which is properly speaking a sin,
                           or sinful, but only speaks of sin improperly such, that is of a corrupt inclination, of a rebellious nature corrupted by original
                           sin, of a strife betwixt the spirit and the flesh, which remains for a trial in the most virtuous persons: of which see again
                           St. Paul, Galatians v. 17. We may take notice that the apostle before spoke of what he <I>was</I> and what <I>he had been,</I>
                           but now speaks in the present time of what he <I>is,</I> and what he <I>doth.</I> (Witham) --- The law is styled <I>spiritual:</I>
                           1st, because it prescribes what appertains to the spirit, and to the spiritual man: i.e. to follow virtue and shun vice: 2nd,
                           because it directs man to the worship of God, which is spirit and truth: 3rd, because it cannot be fulfilled by spiritual

                           no consent, but retain an aversion to them; and so long they never can be truly and properly sins, which must be with full

                           within him, according to the flesh. He does not contradict this passage when he says elsewhere, that our members are the temples

                           be found in our flesh, inasmuch as it is corrupted by sin; whence our Saviour says, "What is born of flesh, is flesh." (John
                           iii.) But good is in our body, when our members under the influence of the soul, renewed by the Holy Ghost residing in it,
                           are employed in good works. The meaning of this passage is, that although now healed and renewed by grace, he could have a
                           perfect desire of doing good; yet still on account of the evil of concupiscence dwelling in his flesh, he found not himself
                           able to perform all the good he wished, because concupiscence was always urging him on to evil against his will. (Estius)</FONT></P><B>

                           avoid here two heretical errors; that of those late pretended reformers, who denying man's free will, hold the commandments
                           of God impossible, even to a just man. See also the first heretical proposition of Jansenius. Next we must detest the late
                           abominable error of those called <I>Quietists,</I> who blushed not to say that a man might yield and abandon himself to the
                           most shameful disorders of the flesh, pretending that it was not they themselves, but sin and the devil that caused these
                           abominations in their flesh. St. Augustine foresaw this frivolous excuse: (lib. i. de. nup. and Concup. chap. xxviii.) "That
                           man (saith he) is in a grievous mistake, who, consenting to the concupiscence of the flesh, and to do what the flesh prompts
                           him to, thinks he can still say: It is not I that do that," &amp;c. (Witham)</FONT></P></FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>
