                           that time Juda,</I> twenty years old, marries the daughter of Sue, and has three sons by her during the three following years.
                           The first takes Thamar to wife, when he was seventeen. Onan marries her the next year; after which, she remains a widow about
                           three years, when she bears twins to Juda. Phares goes down with him into Egypt, and has children there during Jacob's life.
                           On this account, they are numbered among those who went down with Jacob, (chap. xlvi. 12,) as the children of Benjamin seem
                           to be likewise. Thus all these events might happen during the twenty-three years that Jacob dwelt in Chanaan, and the seventeen
                           that he sojourned in Egypt. Some have thought the time too short, and have concluded that Juda had been married long before
                           Joseph's slavery. He was, however, only four years older. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           This was then customary among the Chanaanites, as Philo insinuates. It also continued to be practised in Egypt, till the year
                           of Christ 491 at least, when the marriage had not been consummated. Moses established it as a law, when no issue had sprung
                           from the deceased brother. (Calmet) (Deuteronomy xxv. 5.) The eldest son bore his name; the rest were called after their own
                           father. This law is now abrogated; and the prohibition, which has been issued by the Church, can be dispensed with only by
                           herself, (Worthington) as was the case in the marriage of Henry VIII, with Catherine, the virgin relict of his brother Arthur.

                           a person must open his eyes to judge which is the right one---or "at the gate of the two fountains leading to Thamnas," Judges
                           xiv. 1. Prostitutes formerly infested the high roads. (Jeremias iii. 2; Ezechiel xvi. 25.) Chrysippus says, "at first harlots
                           remained out of the city, and covered their faces; but afterwards growing more hardened, they laid aside the mask," &amp;c.</FONT></P><B>

                           These were all marks of dignity. "Kings made use of spears, or sceptres, before they wore a diadem." (Trogus. 43.) (Calmet)
                           --- Juda might blame himself for exposing these valuable things, and divesting himself of all his dignity, to gratify his
                           unjustifiable passion. If some have excused both the parties concerned, the Scripture at least sufficiently shews in what
                           light we ought to consider their conduct. Juda himself thought her worthy of death; though in some sense, she was <I>juster</I>
                           than himself, ver. 24, 26. (Haydock) --- She was guilty of a sort of adultery, being engaged to Sela; and also of incest,
                           &amp;c.; whereas the fault of Juda, through ignorance of her person, was simply fornication; which is, however, always contrary
                           to the law of nature, as the pagans themselves confessed. (Grotius in Matthew v.) (Calmet) --- From Christ's choosing to be
                           born of such progenitors, we may learn to adore his humility and tender regard for sinners. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           should be detected in this crime, to be given to the flames, (Leviticus xxi. 9,) and others to be stoned; (Leviticus xx. 10,)

                           She remained a widow afterwards, as she was now rendered unfit to be married either to Juda or Sela. The latter married another
                           woman, Numbers xxvi. 19. (Calmet) --- While Juda was engaged in this unlawful commerce, and yielded to the temptation, Joseph
                           was triumphing over a much greater temptation, in rejecting the solicitations of his master's wife. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                                    the Odollamite, the shepherd of <i>his </i>flock.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And it was told Thamar that her father-in-law was come up to Thamnas

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And she put off the garments of her widowhood, and took a veil: and
                                    changing her dress, sat in the cross way, that leadeth to Thamnas: because Sela was grown up, and she had not been married
                                    to him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 When Juda saw her, he thought she was a harlot: for she had covered

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And going to her, he said: Suffer me to lie with thee: for he knew
                                    her not to be his daughter-in-law. And she answered: What wilt thou give me to enjoy my company?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 He said: I will send thee a kid out of the flock. And when she said
                                    again: I will suffer what thou wilt, if thou give a pledge, till thou send what thou promisest.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Juda said: What wilt thou have for a pledge? She answered: Thy ring
                                    and bracelet, and the staff which thou holdest in thy hand. The woman therefore at one copulation conceived.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And she arose and went her way: and putting off the apparel which
                                    she had taken, put on the garments of her widowhood.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the Odollamite, that he might
                                    receive the pledge again, which he had given to the woman: but he, not finding her,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 Asked the men of that place : Where is the woman that sat in the cross
                                    way? And when they all made answer: There was no harlot in this place,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 He returned to Juda, and said to him: I have not found her; moreover
                                    the men of that place said to me, that there never sat a harlot there.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Juda said : Let her take it to herself, surely she cannot charge us
                                    with a lie, I sent the kid which I promised: and thou didst not find her.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And behold, after three months, they told Juda, saying: Thamar, thy
                                    daughter-in-law, hath played the harlot, and she appeareth to have a big belly. And Juda said : Bring her out that she may
                                    be burnt.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 But when she was led to execution, she sent to her father-in-law,
                                    saying: By the man, to whom these things belong, I am with child. See whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this is.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She is juster than I: because
                                    I did not give her to Sela, my son. However, he knew her no more.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 *And when she was ready to be brought to bed, there appeared twins
                                    in her womb: and in the very delivery of the infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a scarlet thread, saying:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 This shall come forth the first.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth: and the woman
                                    said: Why is the partition divided for thee? and therefore called his name Phares.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 *Afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread:
                                    and she called his name Zara.</font></p>
