                           <I>Bethphage,</I> was a village of the priests, and signifies the house of figs and dates, or the house of the fountain, or
                           of the flatterer, situated on the declivity of Mount Olivet, about a mile to the east of Jerusalem, a sabbath-day's journey.
                           As Bethphage was probably so called from the fig and date trees growing there, Mount Olivet was from the great number of olive-trees:&nbsp;<I><U>ton
                           elaion</U>.</I> The triumphal entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem from Bethania, was on the first day of the week, answering
                           to our Sunday, the very day on which, by the appointment of the law, (Exodus xii. 3.) the lamb was brought hither, to be sacrificed
                           at the Passover. To shew, moreover, that in himself all the figures of the old law were realized, he chose that very night
                           for the institution of the Passover of the new law, the blessed eucharist, which was appointed for the immolation of the paschal
                           lamb in the old law, and the very day for the redemption of the world, in which the people of God had formerly been redeemed
                           from Egyptian bondage. ... When they were arrived to the mid-way between Bethania (which he had just quitted) and Bethphage,
                           he sends two of his disciples. In the Greek it is, <I><U>Kai elthon eis Bethphage</U>;</I> i.e. <I><U>eporeuonto</U>,</I>
                           they were travelling to Bethphage, and were near the place, within sight of it, but had not reached it, as we learn from both
                           St. Mark and St. Luke.</FONT></P><B>

                           as Virgil says, Italiam contra. (Ã†neid i.) Some authors think it was Bethphage. (Haydock) --- <I>An ass tied,</I>[1]<I> and
                           a colt with her.</I> This colt, which never yet had been rid upon, represented the people of the Gentiles, to whom God had
                           not given a written law, as he had done to the Jews. Here was manifestly fulfilled the prophecy of Zacharias. (Chap. ix.)
                           It was now the first day of the week, in which Christ suffered; he was pleased to enter into Jerusalem in a kind of triumph,
                           the people making acclamations to him, as to their king and Messias. (Witham) --- Both Jews and Gentiles, figured by the ass
                           and the colt, are to be loosed and conducted by the hands of the apostles of Christ to their Redeemer. The Gentiles, represented
                           by the colt, though heretofore unclean, no sooner receive Jesus resting upon them, than they are freed from every stain and
                           rendered perfectly clean. The zeal of the <FONT size=3>Gentiles stirred up the emulation of the Jews; therefore did the ass
                           follow after its colt. This approach of the Jews to the true faith, after the vocation of the Gentiles</FONT>, is spoken of
                           by St. Paul, Romans xi. 25. <I>Blindness in part has happened in Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles should come in.
                           And so all Israel should be saved.</I> (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxvi.) --- As it is written, <I>"there shall come out of Sion,
                           he that shall deliver, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. And this is to them my covenant;" when I shall take away
                           their sins.</I> This prophecy of Isaias (lix. 20.) St. Paul applies to the conversion of the Jews; (ibid. [Romans xi. 25])
                           and thus both Jew and Gentile are to take up our Saviour's yoke, which is certainly sweet, and his burden light.</FONT></P><B>

                           not by accident, not through novelty or to avoid fatigue, but as the evangelist declares, to accomplish the prophecy of Isaias

                           thereon.</I> St. Jerome reprobates the opinion of those who suppose that Christ rode upon both the ass and the colt, though
                           without sufficient reason. The Greek indeed, <I><U>epano auton</U>,</I> upon them, may be referred either to the beasts or
                           to&nbsp;<I><U>ta imatia</U>,</I> the garments; but the very general sentiment is, that he first sat upon the ass for a short
                           time, and then mounted the colt. It may be asked why Jesus, who through humility had during his whole life travelled on foot,
                           and in no one previous instance is found to have allowed himself the convenience of riding, should on this occasion enter
                           Jerusalem riding? One reason was, as mentioned in note on ver. 4, supra, to fulfil the prophecy of Zarcharias, who had given
                           this mark of the Messias. Hence St. John (Chrysostom, hom. lxvi.) challenges the Jews to shew him any other king of theirs,
                           who had entered Jerusalem riding on an ass. Other reasons were, to give a faint specimen of his real kingly dignity before
                           he suffered; to be publicly acknowledged for the Messias; to confirm the faith of his disciples; and to leave his enemies
                           no excuse for their incredulity. On this, as on all other occasions, magnificence is admirably blended with humility, in our
                           Saviour's actions. Even in this his triumph, we cannot help admiring his humility, in riding upon an ass. (Jansenius) ---
                           The glorious reception he met with from the people, was perfectly voluntary on their parts, the genuine effusions of their
                           hearts, and as such, infinitely superior to the vain and often forced parade bestowed upon earthly princes; and is commemorated
                           in the blessing and distributing of palms in the Catholic Church, on Palm-Sunday, all over the Christian world.</FONT></P><B>

                           or <I>hosiah-na,</I> was an acclamation of the Jews: when applied to God, means <I>save us, I beseech Thee;</I> when applied
                           to a sovereign prince, means <I>vivat,</I> in Latin, or long live the king. (Bible de Vence) --- Hosanna, says St. Jerome,
                           is the same as, <I>Save, I beseech thee.</I> (Psalm cxvii.) Some will have the word <I>Hosanna</I> directed to Christ himself,
                           and the sense to be, Save us, O thou Son of David; others understand <I>Hosanna,</I> directed to <I>God,</I> as if the people
                           said, Save, O Lord, this our king; by which the people wished peace, safety, and prosperity to Jesus their Messias. (Witham)
                           ---It appears that the Holy Ghost, on this occasion secretly inspired their tongues, and through their means caused loud thanks
                           to be offered to Jesus, for an approaching blessing, of which as yet they had no conception. --- These same words of acclamation
                           are daily used in the preface of the mass, and represent the exultations of both priest and people, expecting, as it were,
                           and rejoicing at his coming. (Bristow)</FONT></P><B>

                           Man was extolled as God, and God extolled in man. The elders, admiring his heavenly virtue, exclaimed, who is the king of

                           they might purchase the victims, &amp;c. But as the law forbade usury, they received other fruits, grapes, &amp;c. in return.
                           These persons, beyond a doubt, beheld a more than human brightness darting from his eyes, otherwise they would not have suffered
                           him to act thus. In the same manner, the servants of the high priest fell down when they came to apprehend Jesus, at these

                           be able to expel from the temple that multitude of Scribes and Pharisees, who were so maliciously bent upon his destruction,
                           and so greedy of gain. Something more than human appeared in his celestial countenance on this occasion, and the majesty of
                           the divinity shewed itself in his looks and gestures. Igneum quiddam, atque sidereum radiabat ex oculis ejus, et divinitatis
                           majestas lucebat in facie. (St. Jerome) --- Hence it is not to be wondered at, if in the utmost fear and consternation they
                           fled away. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           St. Augustine (lib. de doct. christ. chap. xi.) thinks this word is an interjection of joy, without any particular meaning,
                           denoting only affection, as <I>Racha</I> is an expression of indignation. This opinion seems supported by the interpreters
                           not having translated either of these words, but retained them in the Greek and in the Latin versions. It seems more than
                           probable, according to St. Jerome, that the whole sentence is taken from Psalm cxvii. 25 and 26, in which&nbsp;supposition,
                           <I>hosanna</I> will signify <I>God save;</I> the word <I>me,</I> though in the verse of the Psalm just mentioned, is not in
                           the Hebrew. It is a familiar acclamation among the Jews, which they sung every day on the feast of the tabernacles, carrying
                           branches in their hands. (The feast of the tabernacles was figurative of Christ's divinity, resting under the tabernacle of
                           our humanity.) The manner in which it was chanted, was not unlike our litanies. First some name or attribute of the Deity
                           was sung, as "For thy own sake, O Lord of Lords," to which the people answered, "hosanna," or "save us," "by thy covenant,"
                           "save us," "thy holy temple," "Hosanna, save us." These litanies were very long, and are said at present by the Jews in their
                           synagogues. Many things have undoubtedly been added in process of time, but they most probably were in use from the beginning.

                           the morning,</I> returning into the city, he was hungry. This hunger, though real and pressing, was mysterious, and affords
                           an opportunity of giving instruction both to the Jews and to all his disciples. By the fig-tree, was represented the Jewish
                           synagogue; the hunger of Christ was a figure of his extreme desire of finding it productive of good works, (and there is no
                           time nor season when the servants of God can be excused from bringing forth good works) answerable to the pains of cultivation
                           he had taken for more than three years. The leaves were their pompous shew of exterior service, the barren foliage of legal
                           rites, void of the internal spirit and good works, the only valuable produce of the tree. By the withering of the tree subsequent
                           to Christ's imprecation, the reprobation and utter barrenness of the synagogue are represented. St. Mark observes, (xi. 13,)
                           that it was not the season for figs; nor are we to suppose that our Saviour went up to the tree expecting to find fruit; but
                           if some of the evangelists mention this circumstance, they only relate the surmises of the disciples. Though he had before
                           shewn his power by innumerable miracles, Christ still thought this necessary to excite the hearts of his disciples to greater
                           confidence. He had often exercised his power to do good, but now for the first time shews himself able to punish. Thus he
                           testifies to the apostles and to the Jews themselves, that he could with a word have made his crucifiers wither away, and
                           therefore that he willingly bore the extremity of the sufferings he should in a few days have to undergo. (St. Chrysostom,

                           of the cast-off Gentiles. For they having never heard the law, nor promised obedience have still shewn their submission by

                           From this text, it appears that the princes of the Jews knew Jesus to be the Messias, and that it was only through envy and
                           malice they were so blinded as not to acknowledge him for the Son of God. When, therefore, the apostle says, (1 Corinthians
                           ii. 8,) <I>If they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;</I> this, it is probable, must be understood
                           of the common people, since we can hardly believe that the princes of the people were ignorant of it, as Christ had so repeatedly
                           inculcated this truth, that he even says himself they had no excuse, and were only actuated by hatred against him and his
                           Father. (St. John xv. 22.) (Tirinus) --- <I>Inheritance,</I> &amp;c. It appears from St. John xi. that one of the motives
                           why the Jews killed our Saviour was, lest if they let him live, all men should believe, and the Romans should come and destroy
                           their nation. But the very means they took to secure their kingdom to themselves, hastened their downfall, and eventually
                           caused their ruin; since in punishment of their crucifying Jesus Christ, their city and state were completely ruined under
                           the Roman emperors Titus and Vespasian. (Nicholas of Lyra.)</FONT></P><B>
