                           or as many translate, "had sent," as if Josue had dismissed the spies immediately after the mourning of Moses was ended, (Calmet)
                           on the 1st of Nisan. On the second day they examined the city, and were obliged to flee in the night. But they only returned
                           to their brethren on the 6th. On the following day Josue gave orders to make all necessary preparations for their departure,
                           and crossed the Jordan on the 10th of the month. (Salien, B.C. 1469.) --- <I>Setim</I> was about eight or nine miles from
                           the river, "or sixty stadia." (Josephus, [Antiquities?] v. 1.) --- <I>Two men.</I> Septuagint intimate that they were <I>young.</I>
                           See chap. vi. 23. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins assert, without reason, that Caleb and Phinees were chosen, and that they pretended
                           that they were <I>deaf,</I> (<I>eross</I>) a word which the Vulgate translates, <I>secretly.</I> (Calmet) --- <I>Jericho.</I>
                           Josue had himself examined the country some time before. But there might have been many changes, and he might not know the
                           present disposition of the people of Jericho. (Haydock) --- This city was built in a delightful plain, surrounded by mountains,
                           (Calmet) except on the east side, chap. iv. 13. (Haydock) --- <I>Harlot.</I> Hebrew <I>zona</I> may also signify an "innkeeper,"
                           as such places were under the direction of women, who were commonly of a very loose character. Hence the Greeks deemed it
                           a dishonour to enter into a public house. Isocrates says, that "even an honest servant will not dare to enter into an ale-house,
                           to eat or drink." (Athen. Dipn. 13.) --- <I>Rahab</I> might have been formerly addicted to pleasure, as the Scripture and
                           the Fathers agree; (Hebrews xi. 31., and James ii. 25.) (Calmet) though she might at this time be very discreet, being awakened
                           by the account of the miracles which God had wrought in favour of his people, who, she knew, were approaching to take possession
                           of the country. The spies might, therefore, take shelter in her house with the least suspicion, and without danger of injuring
                           their character. (Haydock) --- The woman was not very old, as she was afterwards married to Salmon. (St. Matthew i. 5.) ---
                           <I>With her.</I> They spent the first night in her house, entering the city in the dusk of the evening, so that they had not
                           time to make any observations till the following day. (Salien) --- Others think that they were suspected by the people of
                           the town almost immediately, and denounced to the king. Hence they were forced to flee that same night, without having accomplished
                           their design, and were only informed by Rahab of the dismay which had seized the inhabitants, ver. 11.</FONT></P><B>

                           She spoke to them through a window. The messengers did not enter into her house; whence Serarius infers, that Rahab was a
                           person consecrated to some impure deity, and therefore held in some estimation among the people of Jericho, as this was a
                           city of the moon, in whose honour such consecrations were generally made. But these arguments are not very convincing. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           or "had hidden," as (ver. 6,) she had made the men retire before she spoke to the messengers, and probably before they came
                           to demand them. As soon as she was informed of their design, she took all prudent precautions both for her own and their safety,
                           as she could not have escaped death, if she had been discovered affording shelter to the enemies of her country. She felt
                           herself authorized by God on this occasion, to abandon those upon whom he had declared war, and who could have derived no
                           benefit from the spies being betrayed to them. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           the time,</I> not precisely, as otherwise the men who shut the gates must have seen them, but about that time, (Calmet) Rahab
                           pretends that the spies had left her house, and had directed their course towards the gate, so that she made no doubt but
                           they might easily overtake them. (Haydock) --- Notwithstanding this officious lie, which is a venial sin, St. Paul and St.
                           James testify that she was justified by her faith in God, and by good works towards these men. See St. Augustine, contra Mend.
                           17. and note on James ii. 25. (Worthington) --- Rahab might suppose that an officious lie was not a sin, (Menochius) as many
                           great and learned men seemed to have maintained this doctrine. See Grotius, Jur. iii. 1. 9.; Origen, contra Cels. iv. p. 171.;
                           St. Chrysostom, hom. 53, Genesis. She was so far from intending to do an injury to any one, that she consulted the welfare
                           both of her guests and of her countrymen, who, if they had detected the spies and committed murder, would have thus brought
                           greater destruction upon themselves, as they could not escape the wrath of God. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           the best chance of finding them, as the Israelites were on the opposite side of the river. (Haydock) --- As soon as they were
                           gone out of the city, the guards shut the <I>gate,</I> that if the spies should still be lurking within, they might be hindered

                           It seems as if the spies had been ignorant of the danger to which they had been just exposed, and had gone to the roof of
                           the house with a design to pass the night in greater security. Rahab perceives, however, that it would be extremely rash for
                           them to continue with her any longer, and therefore she gives them the best advice, to secure their safety by fleeing in the
                           dead of the night, and without further delay. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>
