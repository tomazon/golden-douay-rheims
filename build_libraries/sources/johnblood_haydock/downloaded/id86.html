                           If Jesus Christ had not publicly given undeniable proofs of his mission, by his miracles, the Pharisees would have had a right
                           to demand an answer to this question; but, after what had been done in their own sight, it was no longer excusable to oppose
                           the preaching of the Son of God. (Calmet) --- Our Saviour himself teaches, that if he had not proved the divinity of his mission
                           by his doctrine and works, it had been no sin to disbelieve or reject him. (John v. 31. and 36. and also x. 25, 37, and xv.

                           does not gratify them by a direct answer; they did not deserve it, because they only interrogated him through captious and
                           improper motives. He only replies by casting on them the very difficulties with which they sought to entangle him. (Calmet)
                           --- Our divine Redeemer proposes to the chief priests a question concerning St. John the Baptist, to shew them how inconsistent
                           was their uniform opposition to the ways of God. Because, though they believed in what was preached by St. John, (at least
                           outwardly, through fear of the Jews) yet they would not believe <I>him, or his </I>doctrines, to whom St. John had given testimony,

                           vineyard, he may punish the negligent more severely, and reward the diligent with greater liberality. Likewise God is more
                           intimately present with the good, by continually showering down upon them his special graces; and less so with the wicked,
                           by refusing them, on account of their indispositions, any of his favours. (St. Ambrose)</FONT></P><B>

                           this whole parable may be applied exactly to the Jews, to the prophets and Christ; so may this last part, with no less accuracy,
                           be applied to our Saviour. The husbandmen, before they killed the lord's beloved son, first cast him out of the vineyard.
                           So the Jews did not kill the Son of God immediately themselves: they first cast him out from themselves, into the hands of
                           Pilate, a Gentile, and then procured his death. (Theophylactus) --- Thus sinners likewise act, by casting Christ out of their
                           hearts, and crucifying him by sin. (Ven. Bede) --- To reconcile St. Matthew and St. Luke, we must observe, says St. Augustine
                           that this parable was not only spoken to those who questioned his authority, but to the people themselves; as St. Luke tells

                           the state of things in this mortal life and in that which is to come: that marriage necessary here, will be unnecessary hereafter.
                           For, in this life, they are children of men, subject to death, and therefore under the necessity of continuing their race
                           by generation; but in the next life, they shall be <I>children of resurrection,</I> living for eternity, never to die, and
                           consequently sons of God, and immortal. Resurrection is a kind of regeneration to immortality. Hence St. Paul explains to
                           our Saviour's rising again, these words of the 2nd Psalm: <I>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</I> (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           How is he the Son of David, and his Lord? Not by human, but by divine dominion. (St. Cyril) --- He has two natures: the nature
                           of man, according to which, David was his father; and the nature of God, according to which, he was Son of God, and Lord of

                           and in every part of their conduct. If our Saviour here attacks them upon their long trains, or other affected forms of their

                           shall receive a greater condemnation, because they not only commit ordinary evil actions, but also make their prayers, and
                           virtue itself, a cloak to their hypocrisy and vanity, and the cause of their greater depravity, famishing the widows whom
                           themselves ought to compassionate and relieve. (Theophylactus) --- Or, the greater honours and rewards they received for their
                           wickedness, the greater punishment must they endure to expiate it. (Ven. Bede) --- Jesus Christ seems in this place to allude
                           to the avaricious practice of the Jews, draining the purses of widows by their stipulated long prayers for their departed
                           husbands, (see Matthew xxiii. 14.; Mark xii. 40.) and thus abusing so holy a thing as prayer, merely to gratify their avarice.

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And again he sent another servant. But they beat him also, and treating
                                    him reproachfully, sent him away empty.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And again he sent the third: and they wounded him also, and cast him

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 Then the lord of the vineyard said: What shall I do? I will send my

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they thought within themselves, saying:
