                           Almighty appointed to Moses that there should be but one high priest at a time, to whom, at his decease, a successor should
                           be chosen. This rule obtained till the time of David, by whom, by the inspiration of God, many were appointed at once. (1
                           Paralipomenon chap. xxiv.) According to this regulation,&nbsp;Zachary (Zacharias) is said to perform the office of priest,
                           according to the order of his course. (Ven. Bede) --- Zacharias seems here to be described as high priest, who once a year
                           entered alone in the inward sanctuary with the blood of the victims, which he offered for himself and the sins of the people.
                           (St. Ambrose) --- He was not chosen by a fresh lot to offer up incense, but by a previous lot, according to which the family
                           of Abia succeeded to the office of high priest. The people waited without, according to Leviticus xvi. 12.; whilst the high
                           priest carried the incense into the holy of holies, on the 10th day of the 7th month. (Ven. Bede) --- <I>Of the course of
                           Abia.</I>[2] What we read in the Greek for <I>course,</I> is commonly put for the employment of <I>one day,</I> but here for
                           the functions of a <I>whole week.</I> For by appointment of David, (1 Paralipomenon xxiv,) the descendants from Aaron were
                           divided into 24 families; of which the eighth was Abia, from whom descended this Zacharias, who at this time was in the week
                           of his priestly functions. (Witham) --- It is worthy of remark, that there were three Herods. The first was the one here spoken
                           of, (surnamed Ascalonite, from his palace in the city of Ascalon, in Palestine) the same who murdered the Innocents. The second
                           was the son of the first, (surnamed Antipas) who derided Christ at the time of his passion, the same who beheaded the Baptist.
                           The third was Herod Agrippa, who beheaded St. James, imprisoned St. Peter, and who was afterwards, for his great pride, stricken
                           by an angel, and devoured by worms. Our Saviour was born in the reign of the first Herod, by whom the prophecy of Jacob, related
                           in the book of Genesis (chap. xlix,) was fulfilled: <I>The sceptre shall not be taken,</I> &amp;c. Herod was an Idumæan, and
                           made king of the Jews by the Romans. The Jews, after they entered the land of promise, were first governed by judges, until
                           Saul: then by kings, until the Babylonian captivity; after that by high priests, until the time of Hyrcanus, whom Herod having
                           killed, succeeded. From that period to the present day, they have been governed by strangers. (Ven. Bede, and Denis the Carthusian)
                           --- Elizabeth was of the race of Aaron, by her father; but her mother was probably of the race of David, from whom the blessed
                           Virgin, cousin of Elizabeth, descended. See below, ver. 36.</FONT></P><B>

                           which are called <I>venial</I> faults; but only from such sins as might make them forfeit the grace and favour of God. (Witham)
                           --- Three things are here to be noticed: 1. that good men do keep all God's commandments, which some moderns declare to be
                           impossible; 2. that men are justified not by imputation only of Christ's justice, nor by faith alone, but by walking in the
                           commandments; 3. that keeping and doing the commandments, is properly our justification through Jesus Christ. The Greek word
                           <I><U>dikaiomata</U>,</I> is properly rendered by Catholics, <I>justifications</I> or commandments, because the keeping of
                           them through Jesus Christ, is justification. But our separated brethren purposely avoid this word against the justification
                           of the Catholics, as one of their leaders in innovation blushes not to advance. Hence Beza, in his annotations on the New
                           Testament, ann. 1556, uses the word constituta, which his scholars render into English by <I>ordinances.</I> (Bristow)</FONT></P><B>

                           (Witham) --- We here see that the priest's functions profited the people, though they neither heard nor saw the priest, but
                           only joined in intention with him; and so may the prayers of the priest in the Catholic Church, though offered up in an unknown

                           Ben.) that he was praying to have children, when his wife was so advanced in years; <I>that </I>he did not think possible;
                           but he was praying for the people, and for the coming of the Messias. See St. Chrysostom, hom. ii. de incomprehensibili, tom.
                           1, p. 454. Nov. Ed. Ben. (Witham) --- Zacharias so far despaired of having any offspring, that he did not believe the angel,
                           when he made him the promise. When therefore the angel says, <I>thy prayer is heard,</I> we must understand it of the prayer
                           he offered in behalf of the people, to whom salvation and remission of sins were to be brought by Christ. The angel, moreover,
                           told him of the birth of his son, who was to be the precursor of Christ. (St. Augustine) --- The son that is to be born of
                           thee, will shew that thy prayer is heard, when he cries out, <I>behold the Lamb of God.</I> (St. Chrysostom) --- It is always
                           a mark of singular merit, whenever the Almighty either appoints or changes the name of a man. (Ven. Bede) --- The name of
                           <I>John</I> is derived from the Hebrew word, <I>Jochanan,</I> which frequently occurs in the Old Testament, as 1 Paralipomenon
                           iii. 15. and vi. 9. and xii. 12. &amp;c. and signifies, <I>blessed with grace or divine favour;</I> see also in Isaias xxx.

                           force captive and degraded kings to pay him homage: but, what is much greater, preaching in a desert, he renounced the pleasures
                           of the world, and with the greatest fortitude repressed and subdued the concupiscence of the flesh. Therefore it is said,
                           he <I>shall drink no wine, nor strong drink.</I> (St. Ambrose) --- <I>And shall drink no wine, nor strong drink:</I>[4] literally,
                           <I>sicera,</I> by which is signified any liquor that is apt to make a man drunk, according to St. Jerome. (Witham) --- This
                           prohibition of the angel was a part of the consecration of the Nazarites. See Numbers vi. 3. The word <I>sicera</I> properly
                           signifies wine of the palm-tree; and next to wine of the grape, there was no more common liquor, none more intoxicating. (Bible
                           de Vence) --- <I>And he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb;</I> from which words some conjecture,
                           that St. John the Baptist, though conceived in original sin, yet might have been freed from the guilt of it before he came

                           converted by the preaching of St. John, they shall rejoice, and be reconciled to their children, the Jews: for as our Saviour
                           tells us, (Luke xv. 7.) <I>there is joy in heaven upon any one sinner that doth penance.</I> The angel, to explain the foregoing
                           words, adds, <I>and the incredulous to the wisdom and prudence of the just;</I> i.e. St. John's preaching shall make them
                           truly wise and just. (Witham) --- With reason is he said to precede Christ, who was his forerunner both in his birth and in
                           his death. In the spirit of prophecy, and in the power of abstinence, and patience, and zeal, they resembled each other; Elias
                           was in the desert, St. John was in the desert also. The one sought not the favour of king Achab, the other despised the favour
                           of Herod. The one divided the Jordan, the other changed it into a laver of salvation. The one is to be the forerunner of Jesus
                           Christ's second coming, as the other was of his first. (St. Ambrose)</FONT></P><B>

                           John remained in the desert till the 30th year of his age. The reason why he concealed himself so long was because he feared
                           the cruelty of Herod; for, though he was not under his jurisdiction, not being on the confines of Bethlehem, yet on account
                           of the remarkable events that took place at his birth, by which he was declared the precursor of the Messias, he had reason
                           to dread the cruelty of the jealous and suspicious Herod. Peter of Alexandria, Nicephorus, Baronius, and others, say, that
                           when he was yet in his mother's arms, he was conveyed into the desert, and there concealed in the caves and fissures of the
                           rocks, where people concealed themselves on the approach of their enemies. Cedrinus adds, that 40 days after their flight,
                           the mother of St. John died; after which, an angel is said to have undertaken the care of the Baptist; but most probably this
                           office was performed by some attendant on St. Elizabeth. (Tirinus) ---The Baptist remained in the desert till he began his
                           public ministry, which by a law of the Jews could not be much before he had attained his 30th year. He is styled by antiquity
                           the first hermit. See St. Jerome in Vita Pauli.</FONT></P>
