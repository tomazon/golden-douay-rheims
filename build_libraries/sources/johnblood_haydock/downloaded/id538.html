                           Hebrew, "take," as [in] chap. iii. 12. Those twelve men were ordered to attend the ark, and to observe the miracle with care:
                           these are chosen to carry the stones for the monuments. (Salien) --- Calmet supposes that they are the same people, and that
                           the former verse might be translated, "the Lord had said." But this does not agree with the context. Hebrew, "and it came
                           to pass, when all the people were clean passed over the Jordan, that the Lord spake." The former injunction was given before
                           they entered the river. Hebrew, "the ark passeth...Now therefore take," &amp;c. (Haydock) --- One was selected from the tribe
                           of Levi, and one from that of Joseph, so that all the twelve tribes were represented. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           The Hebrew term is referred by some to the <I>priests,</I> "from the station of the priests, prepared, <I>or</I> standing
                           firm," (chap. iii. 17,) by others to <I>the stones,</I> which were to be prepared, hard, or exactly twelve. (Calmet) --- The
                           Septuagint have taken it in the latter sense, "twelve stones ready," or such as they might easily find, in the place where
                           the priests had stood. They were of a flinty nature, (Haydock) that they might perpetuate the memory of this event. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           Some hence infer that Josue did not write this book. But surely if he wrote it towards the end of his life, he might well
                           use this expression, (Menochius) as St. Matthew does to denote a shorter term. The twelve stones at Galgal, and in the bed
                           of the Jordan, at Bethabara, (Haydock) were probably each placed apart. See Exodus xxiv. 4. (Menochius) --- They were still
                           to be seen in the days of St. Jerome. Such monuments were formerly very common, and very useful, to make a lasting impression
                           upon the minds of a gross people. See Genesis xxviii. 18., and Leviticus xxvi. 1.</FONT></P><B>

                           up from the midst of the Jordan, after the people had all got to the other side, and the stones were fixed, to denote where

                           It received its name afterwards, chap. v. 9. It lay in a direct line from Jericho to the Jordan eastwards, being ten stadia
                           from the former, and fifty from the latter place. Josue had his camp here while he subdued the kings of Chanaan, (Calmet)
                           as it had plenty of water and wood in its environs; (Menochius) though perhaps at this time, there were no houses. Saul was
                           here recognized king of all Israel, 1 Kings xi. 14. Tertullian (contra Marc. iv.) supposes, that the twelve stones were placed
                           on the ark, <I>in arcam,</I> which is not at all probable. (Calmet) --- But they might be erected in its vicinity, and that
                           may perhaps be the meaning of the author. (Haydock) --- R. Levi says the stones were placed near the ark, that all Israel
                           might see them thrice a year. Josephus believes that an altar was formed of them.</FONT></P><B>
