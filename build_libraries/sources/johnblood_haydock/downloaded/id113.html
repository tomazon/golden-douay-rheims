                           our Saviour had been interred in great haste, the holy women who had before accompanied Jesus in all his journeys, brought
                           perfumes to embalm his sacred body again, in a manner more proper, than Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea had been able to
                           do before. St. John makes mention of Mary Magdalene only, because it was his intention to give a particular relation of all
                           that she did: but we learn from the other evangelists, that there were three holy women at the sepulchre together, viz. Mary
                           Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and Salome. (Calmet) --- This was on the first day of the week, the morrow of the sabbath.
                           (Bible de Vence) --- Christ rose again, leaving the stone and seals still lying on the sepulchre. But as this was to be believed
                           by others also, after the resurrection, the tomb was opened, and thus the belief of what had taken place, propagated. This
                           it was that struck Magdalene; for as soon as she saw the stone rolled from the sepulchre, without entering, or even looking
                           into it, she immediately ran, in the ardour of her affection, to carry the news to the disciples. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxxxiv.
                           in Joan.)</FONT></P><B>

                           resurrection, still being so much accustomed to parables, they did not understand, and imagined something else was meant by

                           where he had placed him, appears to have turned towards the angels, to inquire the cause of the awe and reverence she had
                           observed in them. Upon this, Jesus calls upon her by name, and she, turning again towards him, discovers him by his voice.

                           through the doors, as he did at his resurrection. Maldonatus takes notice, that Calvin was the first that denied this, against
                           the belief of all the ancient Fathers and interpreters, who call this a miracle of divine power. (Witham) --- The same power
                           which could bring Christ's whole body, entire in all its dimensions, through the doors, can, without the least question, make
                           the same body really present in the sacrament; though both the one and the other be above our comprehension. (Challoner) ---
                           Therefore it is a want of faith to limit the power of Christ, by the ordinary rules of place, and to deny that he can be in
                           the blessed Sacrament, and on so many altars as he pleaseth. We do not still join with the Ubiquists or Brentiani, who, quite
                           contrary to the Zuinglians, maintain, that the humanity of Jesus Christ is in every place where his divinity is. This is contrary

                           the Father hath sent me.</I> The word <I>mission,</I> when applied to our Saviour Christ, sometimes signifies his eternal
                           procession from the Father, and sometimes his mission, as he was sent into the world to become man, and the Redeemer of mankind:
                           the first mission agrees with him, as the eternal Son of God; the second, as man, or as both God and man. The mission which
                           Christ here gives his apostles, is like this latter mission, with this great difference, that graces and divine gifts were
                           bestowed on Christ, even as man, without measure: and the apostles had a much lesser share in both these missions. See St.
                           Augustine, lib. iv. de Trin. chap. xix. xx. tom. 4. p. 829. and seq. (Witham) --- Jesus Christ here shews his commission,
                           and so giveth power to his apostles to forgive sins, as when he gave them commission to preach and baptize throughout the
                           world, he made mention of his own power. Hence, whosoever denies the apostles, and their successors, the right of preaching,
                           baptizing, and remitting sins, must consequently deny that Christ, as man, had the power to do the same. St. Cyprian, in the
                           3rd century, ep. lxxiii. says: "for the Lord, in the first place, gave to St. Peter, on whom he built his Church, super quem
                           ædificavit Ecclesiam, the power that what he loosed on earth, should be loosed also in heaven. And after his resurrection,
                           he speaks also to his apostles, saying, as the Father sent me, &amp;c. whose sins you shall forgive," &amp;c. Why, on this
                           occasion, passing over the other apostles, does Jesus Christ address Peter alone? Because he was the mouth, and chief of the
                           apostles. (St. Chrysostom, de Sacerd. lib. ii. chap. 1.)</FONT></P><B>

                           The sense must needs be, that the holy Spirit was not given in that solemn manner, nor with so large an effusion of spiritual
                           gifts and graces, till the day of Pentecost, after Christ's ascension: but the just, at all times, from the beginning of the
                           world, were sanctified by the grace of the Holy Ghost, as no doubt the apostles were, before this time. Now at this present,
                           he gave them the power of forgiving sins. (Witham) --- Some say, that our Saviour did not then confer the Holy Ghost on his
                           disciples, but only prepared them for the receiving of the Holy Ghost. But surely we may understand, that even then they received
                           some portion of spiritual grace, the power, not indeed of raising the dead, and working other miracles, but of forgiving sins.
                           (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxxxv. in Joan.) --- St. Cyril of Alexandria, speaking of the remission of sins, promised in this text,
                           asks, "How then, or why, did Christ impart to his disciples a power, which belongs to the <SPAN lang=EN>divinity alone? It
                           seemed good to him, that they, who had within themselves his divine </SPAN>Spirit, should likewise possess the power of forgiving
                           sins, and of retaining such as they judged expedient; that Holy Spirit, according to his good pleasure, forgiving and retaining,
                           through the ministry of men." (In Joan. lib. xii. chap. 1.)</FONT></P><B>

                           his apostles, and to their successors, bishops and priests, to forgive sins in his name, as his ministers, and instruments,
                           even though they are sinners themselves. For in this, they act not by their own power, nor in their own name, but in the name
                           of God, who as the principal cause, always remitteth sins. This is generally allowed to be done by God's ministers in the
                           sacrament of baptism, as to the remission of original sin; and the Catholic Church has always held the same of God's ministers,
                           in the sacrament of penance. (See the Protestant Common Prayer Book, in the Visitation of the Sick.) --- <I>Whose sins you
                           shall retain, they are retained:</I> by which we see, that to priests is given a power to be exercised, not only by <I>forgiving,</I>
                           but also by <I>retaining;</I> not only by <I>absolving</I> and <I>loosing,</I> but also by <I>binding,</I> by <I>refusing,</I>
                           or <I>deferring</I> absolution, according to the dispositions that are found in sinners, when they accuse themselves of their
                           sins. From hence must needs follow an obligation on the sinner's part, to declare, and confess their sins in particular, to
                           the ministers of God, who are appointed the spiritual judges, and physicians of their souls. A judge must know the cause,
                           and a physician the distemper: the one to pronounce a just sentence, the other to prescribe suitable remedies. (Witham) ---
                           See here the commission, stamped by the broad seal of heaven, by virtue of which, the pastors of Christ's Church absolve repenting
                           sinners upon their confession. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           of greater advantage to the strengthening of our faith, than the ready belief of the rest of the apostles. For when he proceeded
                           to touch, to assure his faith, our minds, laying aside every, even the least doubt, are firmly established in faith. (St.

                           his incredulous dispositions. Our blessed Redeemer would have the mark of the spear, and the prints of the nails to remain
                           in his glorified body, to convince them it was the same body: and that they might be for ever marks of his victory and triumph
                           over sin and the devil. The evangelist does not say, that St. Thomas went and touched Christ's body, though it is very probable
                           he did as he was ordered. But how could a body that entered in, when the doors were shut, be <I>felt,</I> or be <I>palpable?</I>
                           St. Chrysostom[2] answers, that Christ at that time permitted his body to be palpable, and to resist another body, to induce
                           St. Thomas to believe the resurrection; and that when he pleased, his body could not be felt. In like manner, his body was
                           either visible or invisible, as he had a will it should be. In fine, he could eat in their sight, though he stood not in need
                           of any nourishment. See St. Augustine.</FONT></P><I>
