                           The same word occurs here, as (ver. 12,) in Hebrew and Septuagint. (Haydock) --- It relates chiefly to contracts of marriage,
                           which God forbids the faithful to enter into with the Chanaanites, and with other idolatrous nations, lest they should follow
                           their example. Solomon is reprehended for transgressing this law, (3 Kings xi. 1,) and such marriages are called abominations.

                           ceased. Hence a captive woman might be married, (Deuteronomy xxi. 11,) and Salmon took Rahab to wife. If Samson and Esther
                           married with heathens, it might be done by God's dispensation, for weighty reasons. (Tirinus) --- <I>Fornication.</I> On account

                           (2 Corinthians iii. 7,) says, the Hebrews could not look steadfastly at the face of Moses, on account of the glory of his

                           them, as they are <I>hidden to those who perish,</I> 2 Corinthians iv. 3. The Jews are much enraged at some Christians, who

                           though he had often conversed with the Lord: but now, having seen the glorious vision, they adhered to him during the remainder
                           of his life, particularly when he enforced the obligations of the law to the people. (Haydock) --- The Arabs make their hair
                           stand up like little horns, when they are about 40 years old. (Patric. ii. 4. Navig.) Homer mentions the like custom, and
                           Diomed laughs at Paris calling him <I>the pretty-horned.</I> (Iliad xi.) Many of the ancient heroes and gods are represented
                           with horns, particularly Bacchus, whose history reminds us of many particulars, which belong to Moses. He was born or educated
                           in the confines of Egypt, was exposed on the waters, in a box; had two mothers, and very beautiful. While his army enjoyed
                           the light, the Indians were in darkness. He was preceded by a pillar, had women in his train, dried up rivers with his <I>thyrsus</I>
                           or wand, which had crawled, like a serpent, &amp;c. (Huet. &amp;c.) St. Epiphanius (her. 55,) says the Idumeans adored Moses.
                           Their idol is called Choze by Josephus, (Antiquities xviii. 11,) which may be derived from Chus, the ancestor of Sephora,
                           as Bacchus and Iacchus may denote "the son <I>Bar,</I> or the god Chus," <I>Jah-Chus,</I> who was adored in Arabia; so that
                           Moses, Choze, and Bacchus, probably mean the same person. Chus peopled that part of Arabia where the Hebrews sojourned, Numbers
