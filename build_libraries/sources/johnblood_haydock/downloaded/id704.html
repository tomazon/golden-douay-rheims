                           Canticle of Canticles v. 16. (Calmet) --- Many also, like Job, had a lively expectation of their Redeemer's coming from the
                           tradition of the patriarchs. (Haydock) --- Hebrew, "the desires of all nations shall come:" (Haydock) <i>venient.</i> Septuagint,
                           "the chosen things," &amp;c. Christ shall come for all, (Calmet) and the elect shall meet him with eagerness. (Haydock) ---
                           In vain do the Jews attempt to contest this prediction. Was not the Messias to be desired? and has not Jesus Christ procured
                           the greatest advantages for mankind?</font></p><b>

                           <i>Peace:</i> another title of the Messias. His presence ennobles this temple (Calmet) more than precious ornaments of gold
                           and silver (ver. 9.) did that of Solomon. (Haydock) --- Some have pretended that the second temple, repaired by Herod, was
                           more spacious and magnificent than the former. It also subsisted a longer time. But this circumstance adds no superior value,
                           unless the structure was better finished. What Josephus relates of Herod's repairs, is denied by several respectable modern
                           authors. (Salien, year of the world 4035, &amp;c.) --- Yet as the fact was so recent, it seems it had some foundation, though
                           the account may be greatly exaggerated. Josephus was not always exact. (Calmet) --- The Jews all agree that the temple of
                           Zorobabel and of Herod was the same. (Lempereur.) --- It is almost certain that this edifice was never honoured with the ark,
                           &amp;c., like that of Solomon; so that if it be not on account of the Messias, no good reason appears for giving it the preference.
                           (Haydock) --- The ancients who had seen the former, wept (Worthington) when that of Zorobabel was founded, confessing its
                           inferiority (Haydock) both in size and elegance. It was only 60 cubits high and broad, while the former was 120, built of
                           polished stone and covered with cedar. Zorobabel had rough stones, 1 Esdras v. 8., and vi. 3., and 2 Paralipomenon iii. 4.,
                           and 3 Kings vi. 7. As for the same temple, enlarged and adorned by Herod, it continued not long in that state; and its chief
                           glory consisted in our Saviour's presence, when he was received in the arms of Simeon, [Luke ii. 28.] and often preached there.
                           Hence St. Augustine (City of God xviii. 45.) shews that the prophet foretells the glory of Christ's mystical temple, the faithful
                           of all nations, in whom he dwells by the grace of the new testament, as in living stones, far more gloriously than in any
                           temple erected by Solomon or after the captivity. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           victim must come in immediate contact with them, to have this effect. (Haydock) --- Those who had touched the dead, rendered
                           both holy and common things unclean for others. There were two sorts of sanctified meat: the victims for sin, which the priests
                           on duty alone could eat, (Leviticus vii. 1, 6.) and the peace-offerings, of which all who were clean might partake, Leviticus
                           xix. The former alone sanctified what they touched. Both must be burnt if they touched any thing unclean, while ordinary food
                           in the same predicament might be consumed by people in mourning, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- That which touched a holy things was
                           sanctified, (Leviticus vi. 18.) but that thing did not sanctify others; so the people, by touching the sacrifices, were only
                           legally holy, and therefore their victims were not acceptable to the Lord as long as they did not comply with their duty of
                           building his temple. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           (Numbers xix. 13, 22.) a person not only became unclean himself, but made everything that he touched unclean. The prophet
                           applies all this to the people, whose souls remained unclean by neglecting the temple of God; and therefore were not sanctified
                           by the flesh they offered in sacrifice, but rather defiled their sacrifices by approaching to them in the state of uncleanness.

                           --- I judge not from natural appearances, as the corn is still in the granary, ver. 20. (Calmet) --- <i>Upon a stone.</i>
                           The foundations had been laid the year after the Jews returned, and an altar set up, 1 Esdras iii. Nothing more of consequence
                           was done till the second year of Darius. The temple was finished and dedicated in the sixth, 1 Esdras vi. 15. Hence Aggeus
                           speaks of the stones to be used hereafter. Those in the foundation were to be laid afresh, (ver. 19) or were not seen or noticed.
                           In the same sense our Saviour predicts, that <i>a stone</i> shall not be left <i>upon a stone</i> in the temple, which the
                           Romans should destroy before that <i>generation</i> had passed away, Matthew xxiv. 2, 34. This was verified within forty years.
                           Yet A. Rutter observes it was more fully accomplished when the Jews dug up the foundations, by order of Julian, who wished
                           to falsify the prediction. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           ripening in seven months, (Pliny, [Natural History?] xviii. 7.) and being cut towards the end of June. (St. Jerome) --- Aggeus

                           <i>Earth.</i> Some great event is denoted. Nothing occurs in history after the second year of Darius, to shew that Zorobabel
                           signalized himself. Theodoret thinks that the irruption of the Scythians, or of Gog, is meant. Others believe (Calmet) that
                           the prophecy relates to Christ, at his first (St. Cyril) or second coming. (St. Jerome) --- But the Hebrew speaks of something
                           past, and we doubt not but the attempt of Cambyses, three years before, is the subject, Ezechiel xxxviii. "I have overcome
                           the throne of kings," Cambyses, and the magi, and have given the kingdom to another family. The enemy has destroyed himself.

                           king or his governor. Hystaspes has declared in thy favour. Nothing could more enhance the authority of Zorobabel than an
                           action so recent, which God seemed to have permitted on his account, and for his glory. (Calmet) --- While all other kingdoms
                           perish, the Church of Christ remains. (Worthington)</font></p><b>
