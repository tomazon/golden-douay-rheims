                           What Michol took, might therefore be some sacred representation, or a statue of some great man. (Genebrad.) (Kimchi; Maimonides)
                           Or it might be some piece of wood, or clothes folded up, so as to make the guards believe that David was in bed. (Bochart,
                           Anim. i. 2. 51.) See Genesis xxxi. 19. (Calmet) --- They would not examine very narrowly. (Haydock) --- The Taraphim denote
                           both idolatrous and sacred things, Osee iii. 4. (Menochius) --- <I>Skin.</I> Vatican and Alexandrian Septuagint, "liver,"

                           the same colour. (Tirinus) --- This is, however, uncertain. The skin might form his pillow or coverlet. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           This is an officious lie. She tells another to excuse herself, ver. 17. The children of Saul strive to prevent their father's
                           cruelty, by taking part with the innocent David. (Haydock) --- It is thought that David composed the 68th Psalm, <I>Eripe,</I>

                           That is, singing praises to God by a divine impulse. God was pleased on this occasion that both Saul's messengers and himself
                           should experience the like impulse, that he might understand, by this instance of the divine power, how vain are the designs
                           of man against him whom God protects. (Challoner) --- The messengers did not return. (Menochius) --- They were seized by the
                           spirit only when they arrived at Najoth. But Saul felt the impression even at Socho, threw aside his garments, and began to
                           act and to speak as one inspired. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Divested of his regal ornaments, (Tirinus) though not in an indecent posture. People are said to be undressed, when they have
                           not such clothes on as might be expected. Hesiod and Virgil say, <I>Nudus ara, sere nudus; hiems ignava colono.</I> "Plough
                           and sow naked; choose a fine season for work, and rest in winter." (Haydock) See Micheas i. 8., and 2 Kings vi. 20. --- Yet
                           some assert (Calmet) that Saul was entirely undressed, as some pretended prophets and slaves go in the hot countries, Isaias
                           xx. 1. We are not to judge of the indecency of such behaviour from our own manners. Some copies read <I>cecinit,</I> (Calmet)
                           and the Douay Bible has "and sang naked." (Haydock) --- Saul had not the gift of prophecy, like holy men, but only like Balaam's
                           ass, for a time. (St. Augustine ad Simp. ii. 1.) (Worthington) --- <I>Prophets.</I> This is something wonderful. (Menochius)
