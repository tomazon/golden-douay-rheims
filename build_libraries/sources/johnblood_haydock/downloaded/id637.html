                           God requires that we should act with prudence. (Du Hamel) --- David probably consulted the Lord, and sent ambassadors to Achis,
                           before he went into his dominions, (Menochius) where he had been in such danger before. (Du Hamel)</FONT></P><B>

                           This was written some time after the death of Samuel. --- <I>Siceleg</I> belonged at first to Juda, and was afterwards given
                           to the tribe of Simeon, till it fell into the hands of the Philistines, and being restored by them to David, was considered
                           afterwards as the property of the kings of Juda. It lay not far from Horma, Josue xix. 4.</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew, "days and four months." The former expression denotes a year; though some would have it, that David remained "four
                           months and a few days" in the country. He probably continued so many months at Geth, (ver. 9, 11,) and about a year at Siceleg.
                           (Calmet) --- Septuagint have "days, four months;" and Salien adopts that term. (Haydock) See chap. xxix. 3. (Du Hamel)</FONT></P><B>

                           Gessuri,</I> &amp;c. These probably were enemies of the people of God; and some, if not all of them, were of the number of
                           those whom God had ordered to be destroyed; which justifies David's proceedings in their regard. Though it is to be observed
                           here, that we are not under an obligation of justifying every thing that he did: for the Scripture, in relating what was done,
                           doth not say that it was <I>well</I> done. And even such as are true servants of God, are not to be imitated in all they do.
                           (Challoner) --- The nations of Chanaan, who inhabited as far as Egypt, and the Amalecites, who had escaped the arms of Saul,
                           were devoted to destruction, Exodus xvii., &amp;c. In such cases, any man might fall upon them, without any other formal declaration
                           of war. (Calmet) --- There was another <I>Gessuri</I> of Syria, in the tribe of Manasses, across the Jordan. (Menochius) ---
                           The country which these people inhabited, to the south of Palestine, was afterwards depopulated by the kings of Egypt and
                           of Syria, in their continual wars, so that many of the cities which are mentioned in Scripture, were never known to profane
                           geographers. (Calmet) --- St. Jerome, (Trad.) Sa, and others, think that David attacked some of the Philistines. But it is
                           as probable at least that he would abstain from molesting them, who had so generously afforded him an asylum. Salien concludes,
                           that he did not attack the other nations, (except the Amalecites, who were sufficiently marked out for destruction, Deuteronomy
                           xxv. 19,) without consulting the Lord, by the high priest, as he was accustomed to do in every difficulty. (Salien, the year
                           of the world 2979) (Menochius) --- They all dwelt in part of the land of Chanaan, (Worthington) which was sufficient. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           the son of Esron, inhabited the most southern parts of Juda. --- <I>Ceni,</I> or the Cinites, descendants of Jethro, (Calmet)
                           who dwelt at Arad and the environs. The words of David might signify that he attacked these people of Israel, as Achis understood
                           him; or that he made inroads upon those who dwelt to the south of them, which was really the case. (Haydock) --- At his return,
                           he passed by Siceleg, where he left the spoil, carrying some of the choicest things, as a present, to Achis. (Menochius) ---
                           But he suffered none of the human race to be carried away captive, lest any of them might disclose the true state of affairs
                           to the king, who might have apprehended that the injured nations would make an attack upon his dominions. (Salien)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew, "he hath made himself stinking (an object of horror) to his people." A strong expression used, Genesis xxxiv. 30.,
                           and Exodus v. 21. (Calmet) --- Septuagint, "he is quite covered with confusion." Achis supposed that David had thus forfeited
                           all his pretensions to dwell among, much less, to reign over Israel: so that he might keep him always in his service. (Haydock)
                           --- In the mean time, Saul was exterminating the people of Gabaon, which brought a pestilence on Israel, 40 years after. (Theodoret)
                           --- He perhaps supposed that the oath of Josue had not been yet put in execution, as it ought to be, herein indulging too
