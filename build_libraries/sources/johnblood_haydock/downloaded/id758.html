                           what Sixtus V had printed <i>Abimelech,</i> conformably to the Hebrew, &amp;c. Some editors have since preferred the latter
                           word, (Calmet) which is retained in Berthier and Calmet, though we should think such changes improper, unless they were made
                           by proper authority. (Haydock) --- Many of the ancients suppose that Achimelech (who is also styled Abimelech, the high priest
                           at Nobe) is here meant, from whom David concealed his real design. [1 Kings xxi.] (Eusebius; St. Athanasius; St. Jerome, &amp;c.)
                           --- Others rather think that the psalm was composed after David had escaped the great danger at the court of Achis, by counterfeiting
                           madness, 1 Kings xxi. 13. (St. Augustine; Muis, &amp;c.) --- Achis alone is styled king among the Satraps. Those who ruled
                           over the Philistines, generally bore the title of Abimelech, as the Egyptian monarchs had that of Pharao. (Berthier) (Genesis
                           xxi. 22.) (Calmet) (Worthington) --- This psalm is alphabetical. The last verse beginning with <i>p,</i> is supernumerary,
                           and may belong to the next psalm. See Psalm xxiv. (Calmet) --- There seems also to be something wanting in ver. 6., (Houbigant)
                           unless <i>e</i> and <i>v</i> have each only one hemistic. (Haydock) --- From the change of names, and of David's countenance,
                           St. Augustine gathers the vocation of the Gentiles, the real presence, &amp;c. (Worthington) See 1 Kings xxi. (Haydock)</font></font></p>

                           that no evil shall come near them. (Haydock) --- This has often been verified, Genesis xxxii.. 1., and xlviii. 16., and 4
                           Kings vi. 16, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- One angel is here represented as equal to a great army. A Protestant commentator observes,
                           that David attributed his escape to the protection of an angel, and was very thankful for it. We see, therefore, what advantages
                           we may derive from the blessed spirits? What then should hinder us from addressing our prayers to them? (Berthier)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Want.</i> In the old law, God was more particularly engaged to defend his servants from distress. Though, as they were
                           sometimes under oppression, they knew that they were to look for more substantial blessings from heaven. Hence they would
                           not have exchanged their condition for that of the richest worldling. Such ought to be still more our sentiments, since we
                           have beheld Christ dying naked on the cross, and his martyrs rejoicing under the most excruciating torments. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Rich</i> of this world, (1 Timothy vi. 17.; Menochius) are often poor in spiritual gifts. (Worthington) --- Those who are
                           poor in both respects, are truly miserable, (Haydock) since they cannot satisfy their craving appetite. But the prophet admires
                           those who are poor in spirit, whether they have many possessions or not. (Berthier) --- <i>The fear of the Lord is his treasure,</i>
                           Isaias xxxiii. 6. The saint is content under every dispensation of Providence. (Haydock) --- Lazarus was truly rich even here;
                           and in heaven he is covered with glory, Luke xvi. 20. (St. Jerome) (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "the lions have wanted." (St. Jerome)
                           --- This may have been the case: yet those who fear God shall be filled; or, the rich may be designated by the name of lion's
                           whelps, on account of their power and avidity. (Calmet) --- The same term, <i>cephirim,</i> is often applied to men in power,
                           Ezechiel xix 2., and Job iv. 10. (Berthier) --- <i>Good.</i> If the saints be sometimes deprived of provisions, they know
                           that it is better for them; as God directs all for their good. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           he may see good." The apostle shews that heaven is here principally meant, though a virtuous life is the best to procure even
                           present happiness. (Berthier) --- Many of David's followers probably confined their views to the latter. (Calmet) --- Every

                           fell victims to persecution, (Hebrews xi. 36.) yet they were perfectly resigned to God's will, (Berthier) and thus obtained

                           his disciples, by assuring them that a hair of their head should not perish, Matthew x. 30. (St. Augustine) (Calmet) --- The
                           elements of our bodies cannot be divided or destroyed by human force, so as to prevent their resurrection. The identical bodies
                           shall rise again, though they may have been subject to many changes, reduced to ashes, or consumed by wild beasts. This mystery
                           has often offended incredulous philosophers. Jesus Christ is the <i>just,</i> by excellence; and this prediction was fulfilled
                           in his person, as St. John (xix. 36.) does not confine himself to the type of the paschal lamb. (Berthier)</font></p>

                           fire. (St. Bernard) --- In punishment of former transgressions, they are suffered to fall into more sins; while those who
                           place their confidence in God's grace, will be preserved. (Worthington) --- "Death is not indeed the last, but those torments

                                    <p>2 I will bless the Lord at all times, his praise shall be always in my mouth.</p>
                                    <p>3 In the Lord shall my soul be praised; let the meek hear and rejoice.</p>

                                    <p>5 I sought the Lord, and he heard me: and he delivered me from all my troubles.</p>

                                    <p>7 This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him: and saved him out of all his troubles.</p>
                                    <p>8 The angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear him: and shall deliver them.</p>
                                    <p>9 O taste, and see that the Lord is sweet: blessed is the man that hopeth in him.</p>

                                    <p>12 Come, children, hearken to me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</p>
                                    <p>13 *Who is the man that desireth life: who loveth to see good days?</p>
                                    <p>14 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.</p>
                                    <p>15 Turn away from evil, and do good: seek after peace, and pursue it.</p>
                                    <p>16 The eyes of the Lord are *upon the just: and his ears unto their prayers.</p>
                                    <p>17 But the countenance of the Lord is against them that do evil things: to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>
                                    <p>18 The just cried, and the Lord heard them: and delivered them out of all their troubles.</p>
                                    <p>19 The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart: and he will save the humble of spirit.</p>
                                    <p>20 Many are the afflictions of the just: but out of them all will the Lord deliver them.</p>
                                    <p>21 The Lord keepeth all their bones, not one of them shall be broken.</p>
                                    <p>22 The death of the wicked is very evil: and they that hate the just shall be guilty.</p>
                                    <p>23 The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall offend.</p></font></font>
