                           speak of, to wit, that by the coming of Christ, and the preaching of his gospel, all both Jews and Gentiles, all nations should
                           be united into one Church, by one and the same faith. (Witham) --- <I>Mystery,</I> &amp;c. Revelation, the same as he mentions
                           Galatians i. 12.; where speaking of his gospel, he says, For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it, but by the
                           revelation of Jesus Christ. This revelation seems to have regarded principally three things: 1. The redemption and justification
                           of man by Jesus; 2. the vocation of the Gentiles; and thirdly, a positive command to announce the gospel to them. He speaks
                           particularly of the second and third. (Estius) --- <I>Made known to me</I> by revelation, and to the other apostles and prophets.

                           were revealed to Abraham, to David, to many prophets and just men in the time of the law; but now it was revealed and made

                           fathers, or patriarchs, is derived from God the Father of all, and communicated to them in an inferior degree. This exposition
                           is found in St. Jerome, in Theodoret, Theophylactus, St. John Damascene, &amp;c. (Witham) --- <I>All paternity,</I> or <I>the

                           is the breadth,</I> &amp;c. It is not expressed to what must be referred these metaphorical words of breadth, length, &amp;c.
                           Some expound them of the charity which in our hearts we ought to have for one another; others, of the love which Christ shewed
                           towards mankind, in coming to redeem all. (Witham) --- <I>What,</I> &amp;c. This thought seems borrowed from Job xi: "Peradventure
                           thou wilt comprehend the steps of God, and wilt find out the Almighty perfectly." The inspired writer then shews us how the
                           Almighty is incomprehensible; for, says he, "God is higher than the heavens; and what wilt thou do? he is deeper than hell;
                           and how wilt thou know? The measure of him is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea." The apostle, alluding to these
                           words, prays that the Ephesians may have faith and charity sufficient to enable them to comprehend all that is comprehensible
                           of God; as St. Dionysius explains it. But we are not hence to conclude, that there exists such a thing as dimension or size
                           with regard to God, for he is a pure Spirit: but these expressions are merely metaphorical. For by <I>breadth</I> we are to
                           understand his virtue and wisdom, which extend over all his creatures: (Ecclesiasticus i.) "he poured out wisdom upon all
                           his works." By <I>length</I> is meant his eternal duration: (Psalm ci.) "but thou, O Lord, remainest for ever." By <I>height</I>
                           we are taught the infinite superiority of his nature over ours: (Psalm cxii.) "The Lord is high above all nations." And by
                           <I>depth</I> we are shewn the incomprehensibility of his wisdom: (Ecclesiastes) "Wisdom is a great depth; who shall find it
                           out?" Hence it appears that the end of faith and charity is, that we may arrive at a <I>perfect</I> faith; which may know,
                           as far as it is intelligible, the greatness of his wisdom, his eternal duration, &amp;c. (St. Thomas Aquinas, in Eph.)</FONT></P><B>
