                           Sigonius thinks that the Caathites performed this office on this as on other occasions. But the Vulgate shews that the priests
                           sometimes carried the ark, perhaps because it was uncovered, chap. vi. 6., and 2 Kings xv. 25. At this period the number of
                           priests was but small. Some of the sons of Eleazar and of Ithamar might be old enough to assist their parents: only two would
                           be necessary at a time, though the Rabbins assign four, (which is not improbable. Theodoret) and pretend that the two who
                           went first were obliged to go backwards, in order that their faces might be turned towards the ark, out of respect. The ark
                           now marked the way for the people, as the cloud had disappeared on the death of Moses. (St. Augustine, q. 3.; Masius.) (Calmet)

                           both to keep the people at a respectful distance, and also to enable them to see which way they were to proceed. When the
                           priests stood in the bed of the river, the waters rose up like a firm wall on the north side, while those to the south flowed
                           away into the lake of Sodom, leaving about 16 miles open for the army of Israel to pass on dry land. The soldiers did not
                           approach within 600 paces of the ark. --- <I>Before.</I> This insinuated that they would pass over in a miraculous manner;
                           though perhaps Josue did not know by what means God would enable them to cross (Calmet) the overflowing waters. Josephus only
                           seems to intimate that they abated suddenly, so that they might be forded, &amp;c. He also greatly diminishes or destroys
                           the miracle performed at the passage of the Red Sea. Yet here he acknowledges a sort of "prodigy in the waters being restrained,"
                           and resuming their usual course as soon as the priests had left the channel of the river. --- <I>And take,</I> &amp;c. Hebrew

                           Josue was only the organ of God, (Calmet) whose orders he announces to the sacred ministers; (ver. 8.; Menochius) though as
                           a civil magistrate, he was bound to hear and to obey them in matters of religion. (Calmet) --- When <I>he</I> ordered circumcision
                           to be administered, when he blessed the multitude, and ratified the covenant between God and the people, (Chap. v., and xxiv.,
                           &amp;c.) he did nothing but what a virtuous governor ought to do; yet he did not these things by virtue of his civil jurisdiction,
                           or in opposition to the spiritual authority of Eleazar. Moses had been the supreme head, being both priest and king. But only
                           <I>part of his glory</I> was communicated to Josue, while Eleazar was directed to consult the Lord for him, (Numbers xxvii.
                           21.; Theodoret, q. 48. in Numbers) Josue was to govern <I>at his word,</I> so that he was bound to consider the high priest
                           as his superior. What he therefore did, was in subordination and conformity to the will of Eleazar and of God, and not designed
                           to shew that the priestly authority belonged to himself, as English Protestants would hence infer. The best of princes, both
                           in the Old and New Testament, have always looked upon it as a part of their duty to promote the true religion. (Worthington)
                           --- Isaias (xlix) foretold that kings and queens would esteem it their glory to guard and to advance the prosperity of the
                           Church. (Haydock) --- Hence they may enact laws for this purpose. (St. Augustine, contra Crescon. iii. 51.) Constantine ratified
                           the judgment passed already by the bishops in the cause of Cecilian, though he confessed at the same time that the determination
                           did not belong to his tribunal; (Worthington) and he greatly disapproved of the conduct of the Donatists, who appealed to
                           him, as the heathens might have done to an emperor, who was at the same time one of their high priests. (Haydock) --- <I>O
                           rabida furoris audacia,</I> said he, <I>sicut in causis gentilium fieri solet, appellationem interposuerunt.</I> (1. Optat.
                           c. Parm. i.; St. Augustine, ep. 166.) Other emperors and kings have acquired great fame, on account of their labours and zeal
                           in defence of the Church. Thus the kings of Spain and of France have obtained the titles of <I>Catholic</I> and <I>Most Christian,</I>
                           and our Henry VIII was honoured by Pope Leo X with the title of <I>Defender of the Faith,</I> in 1521, (Worthington) on account
                           of the book which he presented to that pontiff, while he was yet an obedient son of the Catholic Church, and undertook to
                           defend her faith on the sacraments, against the objections of Luther. Is this the faith which the kings of England defend
                           at present? Whatever the princes might do in the old law in spiritual matters, no inference can be drawn for the same right
                           being now exercised by civil magistrates, how supreme soever in their own sphere. Those princes, Josue, &amp;c. might be considered
                           not only in the light of civil governors, but also in that of <I>prophets</I>, who had a great share in the administration
                           of affairs under the Jewish theocracy. If God chose to make known his will by the mouth of a king, or by that of a <I>shepherd,</I>
                           his mandates were to be put in execution with equal exactitude. But now the distinctive limits of the ecclesiastical and of
                           the civil power are more clearly ascertained. <I>Render therefore to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things
                           that are God's.</I> (Matthew xxii. 21.) The kingdom of Christ is not of <I>this world;</I> neither did he appoint kings to
                           be the <I>pastors</I> of his Church. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Grotius remarks that God made known his choice of the governors of his people by miracles, till the days of Saul. In effect,
                           we hardly find any, before that time, whose public authority was not sanctioned by some prodigy. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew, "when you shall have come to the brink (or extremity) of the water of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan,"
                           (Haydock) which some explain by saying that they were to stop on the eastern bank, as soon as they had wet their feet, (Serarius)
                           while others say they crossed quite over, and stood at the other side. (Masius) --- But it is more probable, that as soon
                           as they had touched the waters, the priests halted till the bed of the river was presently dried up, and then they placed
                           themselves in the middle of it, close to the raging billows, which, rising up like mountains, were stopped in their career,
                           (Haydock) and forced to retire backwards to their source, ver. 15, 17, and chap. iv. 9. (Bonfrere; Cornelius a Lapide) ---

                           to their votaries. Josue gives the people two signs of the divine protection, the destruction of the devoted nations, and
                           the miraculous division of the Jordan, or rather the latter prodigy would be an earnest of the former event; and all, both
                           friends and enemies, might be convinced, that the Lord was with his people, and their present leader, as he had been with
                           Moses. No miracle could have been more suitable for the occasion, none more convincing or useful. (Calmet) --- It would naturally
                           inspire the Israelites with confidence, at the revival of the miracles wrought 40 years before, when their fathers and some
                           of themselves had passed the Red Sea, in a similar manner. At the same time, it would fill the Chanaanites with still greater
                           dismay and teach them that all resistance would prove fruitless. Some have wondered that they did not oppose the passage of
                           the Israelites on this occasion. But it is a greater matter of surprise that they should have ventured on the dangerous expedient
                           of encountering them in war, after what they had seen and heard. It can be attributed to nothing but their infatuation, and
                           that blindness with which God punished them, that they might draw on a more speedy and merited destruction for their crimes.

                           comprised the <I>ten</I> which are mentioned, Genesis xv. 19. The <I>Chanaanite</I> occupied the countries chiefly about Tyre,
                           while the <I>Hethite</I> dwelt in the southern part of Palestine. The <I>Hevite</I> possessed Mount Hermon, Garizim, &amp;c.
                           The <I>Pherezite</I> were not perhaps a separate people, but employed in cultivating the country. The <I>Gergesite</I> were
                           fixed to the east of the lake of Genesareth, the <I>Jebusite</I> at Jerusalem, and the <I>Amorrhite</I> about the Dead Sea.

                           leagues," ver. 4, and 16. But here, supposing that the Jordan was divided over-against Jericho, he says, that "the waters
                           running off into the Dead Sea, would, in all probability, leave not less than two or three thousand paces of the channel dry."</FONT></P>

                           the melted snow, and ready to leave its banks. It was about a stone throw across, and very rapid. See chap. i. 2. The rains
                           which fall in spring, serve to increase the inundation, (Deuteronomy xi. 14,) as well as the snow which melts at that time
