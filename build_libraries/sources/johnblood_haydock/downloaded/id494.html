                           The eastern side of <I>the Jordan</I> is so called in Scripture, with reference to the promised land. (Menochius) --- Hebrew
                           may mean also, "on this side, <I>or</I> at the passage" about <I>Bethabara,</I> "the house of passage," near which the Hebrews
                           were encamped, and where Josue probably crossed over the Jordan, as it was the usual ford. Calmet seems to think that these
                           two first verses have been inverted by Esdras, &amp;c., or interpolated, as he says Moses never crossed the Jordan, and certainly
                           addressed the Hebrews near that river, at a great distance from the Red Sea: but the text does not assert the contrary. It
                           only determines that the place where he harangued them, was a part of the wilderness, or the plains of Moab, <I>over-against
                           the Red Sea,</I> which they had left when they came from Asiongaber, unless the term <I>Suph,</I> which signifies <I>red,</I>
                           may be a proper name of the station Supha, near the torrent Zared, (Numbers xxi. 14,) as Calmet maintains. If this be admitted,
                           this difficulty vanishes, for the camp of Israel was certainly <I>over-against,</I> and not even remote from this place. The
                           other cities may have been in the environs, or Moses may have referred to the stations and places in the desert of Pharan,
                           at Tophel, <I>Laban,</I> or Lebna, <I>Haseroth,</I> (Numbers xxxiii. 17,) <I>where there is very much gold,</I> (Septuagint,
                           "gold mines;" Hebrew, "<I>dizahab,"</I>) and Cades-barne. Lebna, Haseroth, and Cades-barne, were in the territory of the Idumeans,
                           who dwelt to the south-west of the plains of Moab. Tophel and Dizahab are unknown (Calmet) as well as Laban, Haseroth, and
                           Pharan, if they be not the names of encampments. Geographers vary so much in their descriptions of the road, which the Hebrews
                           followed, and in maps of the adjacent countries, that it is now impossible to decide. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           </I>All the distance between Horeb and the Jordan, by Mount <I>Seir,</I> on the road to Cades-barne, might have been travelled
                           in eleven days' time, being about 300 miles; or the Hebrews were so long in going thither, Numbers xxxiii. 17. (Calmet) ---
                           It was to punish the Israelites for their frequent rebellions, that they were condemned to wander in that wilderness forty
                           years. (Du Hamel) --- They might have entered the promised land, when they first came to Cades-barne, from Mount Horeb, (Numbers
                           xiii. 1, 27,) which, even by the circuitous road of Mount Seir, would not have taken them above eleven days. He mentions this
                           to remind them of their folly. Perhaps all the aforesaid places may have been between Horeb and Cades-barne, as Bonfrere maintains
                           that <I>Laban</I> was in the neighbourhood of Sinai, where Moses first received the law which he is now going to explain.
                           His discourse turns upon the chief occurrences of the forty years' journey; and hence, <I>these are the words,</I> (ver. 1,)
                           may refer not only to what he was going to say, but also to the commands which he had already notified to the Israelites,
                           from the passage of the <I>Red Sea</I> till the station Abelsetim, upon the banks of the Jordan, Numbers xxxvi. 13. (Haydock)
                           --- Deuteronomy contains a recapitulation of the law, and therefore it was to be read aloud to all the people on the feast
                           of tabernacles, every seventh year; and the new kings, or rulers of the Hebrews, were commanded to transcribe it, and every
                           day read some part for the rule of their conduct, chap. xvii. 18., and xxxi. 10. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           signifies "sheep," particularly ewes, with their dugs distended with milk. Hence the Sidonians formed the idea of their Astarte,
                           1 Kings xi. 5. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins say, that Astaroth denotes large mountains, generally covered with sheep. <I>Astaroth-Carnaim,</I>

                           He begins, as usual, with commemorating the wonders of God, in favour of an ungrateful people. This book may be considered
                           as a supplement to the other four books. (Calmet) --- We need not wonder, therefore, if we find some new observations. The
                           reason why the sabbath is to be kept, is here said to be in the memory of the law being given to the Hebrews, and their liberation
                           from slavery; (chap. v. 15,) whereas in Exodus, it seems to be designed to remind people that God rested on the seventh day.
