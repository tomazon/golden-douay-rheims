                           The <I>Pharisees</I> observed a rigid and simple mode life, disdaining all luxurious delicacies. They scrupulously followed
                           the dicta of reason, and paid the greatest veneration and implicit obedience to the opinions and traditions of their seniors.
                           All contingencies they ascribe to fate, but not to the exclusion of free-will. The immortality of the soul, and a future state
                           of rewards and punishments, were favourite tenets with them, and their fame for wisdom, temperance, and integrity was proverbial.

                           of which some were works of supererogation, others were contrary to the law. (Estius) --- It is a great proof of malice in
                           the Pharisees, and of irreproachable character in our Lord, that they should be reduce to notice triffles, no ways connected
                           with either piety or religion. ... They moreover betrayed their superstition, by insisting on the observance of these outward
                           ceremonies, as essential parts of piety, which were not commanded by any law, (were certainly of no divine origin) and which,
                           at most, were duties of civility, or emblems of interior purity. (Jansenius) --- <I>The tradition of the ancients?</I> They
                           do not say the written law, which did not prescribe these washings of hands, cups, pots, beds, &amp;c. These traditions came

                           gift whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee.</I>[1] This gift is called <I>Corban,</I> Mark vii. 11. Now, as to
                           the sense of this obscure place, I shall mention two expositions that seem preferable to others. The first is, as if a son
                           said to his father or mother, Whatsoever was mine, (with which indeed I might have assisted you, my parents) I have given,
                           i.e. promised to give to the temple: and being to keep this promise, I need not, or I cannot now assist you. The second interpretation
                           is, as if the son said to his father or mother, Whatsoever gift I have made to God <I>will be profitable to</I> you, as well
                           as to me; or, <I>let it be profitable</I> to you, (which is more according to the Greek text, both here and in St. Mark) and
                           therefore I am no further obliged to assist you. (Witham) --- That is, the offering that I shall make to God, shall be instead
                           of that which should be expended for thy profit. This tradition of the Pharisees was calculated to enrich themselves, by exempting
                           children from giving any further assistance to their parents, if they once offered to the temple and the priests that which
                           should have been the support of their parents. But this was a violation of the law of God, and of nature, which our Saviour
                           here condemns. (Challoner) --- They committed a double crime. They neither offered the gift to God, nor succoured their parents
                           in their distress. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lii.)</FONT></P><B>

                           of the Pharisees; but they rather seem the words of our Saviour Christ, especially seeing that in St. Mark, Christ himself

                           vain</I> they worship, or think they worship God, who neglect the divine commandments to observe the commands of men. We must
                           not here suppose that Christ censures the commands of the Church, or the tradition of the apostles, because these are in nowise
                           contrary to the divine law, but rather serve to enforce it, and reduce it to practice; nor are they so much the commands of
                           men, as of God, delivered to us by his ambassadors. Christ censures such as are merely human, such as those mentioned here,
                           which are vain and futile, as the superstitious washing of hands; or erroneous, as that the soul is defiled by meat; or openly
                           contrary to natural and divine law, as the defrauding parents of their just support. (Tirinus) --- It is evidently erroneous
                           to argue from this text against apostolic traditions. St. Paul tells the Thessalonians, to stand fast, and hold the traditions
                           which they had been taught, whether by word of mouth or by epistles. (2 Thessalonians ii. 14.) --- <I>Commandments of men.</I>
                           The doctrines and commandments here reprehended, are such as are either contrary to the law of God, (as that of neglecting
                           parents, under pretence of giving to God) or at least are frivolous, unprofitable, and no ways conducing to true piety, as
                           that of often washing hands, &amp;c. without regard to the purity of the heart. But as to the rules and ordinances of the
                           holy Church, touching fasts, festivals, &amp;c. these are no ways repugnant to, but highly agreeable to God's holy word, and
                           all Christian piety; neither are they to be counted among the <I>doctrines and commandments of men,</I> because they proceed
                           not from mere human authority, but from that which Christ has established in his Church; whose pastors he has commanded us
                           to hear and obey, even as himself. (Luke x. 16.; Matthew xviii. 17) (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           that to eat any kind of meats,&nbsp;or as often as a man pleaseth on fasting-days, <I>can defile no man.</I> (Witham) ---
                           No uncleaness in meat, nor any dirt contracted by eating it with unwashed hands, can defile the soul; but sin alone, or a
                           disobedience of the heart to the ordinance and will of God. And thus, when <I>Adam</I> took the forbidden fruit, it was not
                           the apple which entered into his mouth, but the disobedience to the law of God, which defiled him. The same is to be said
                           if a <I>Jew,</I> in the time of the old law, had eaten swine's flesh; or a Christian convert, in the days of the apostles,
                           contrary to their ordinance, had eaten blood; or if any of the faithful, at present, should transgress the ordinance of God's
                           Church, by breaking the fasts: for in all these cases the soul would be defiled, not indeed by that which goeth into the mouth,
                           but by the disobedience of the heart, in wilfully transgressing the ordinance of God, or of those who have their authority
                           from him. (Challoner) --- Jesus Christ by no means prohibits fasting and abstinence from certain food, and at certain times,
                           or he would have been immediately accused of contradicting the law; he only says, that meat which they esteem unclean does
                           not of itself, and by its own nature, defile the soul; which is what the Pharisees (and before them Pythagoras, and after
                           them the Manicheans) maintained, and which St. Paul warmly confutes. (1 Timothy iv. 4) (Tirinus) --- If a man gets intoxicated,
                           adducing this same plea, that <I>what entereth by the mouth,</I> &amp;c. is not the answer obvious; that it is not the <I>wine,</I>
                           but the <I>intemperance,</I> contrary to the law of God, which defileth him: <I>for drunkards shall not possess the kingdom

                           When the Pharisees had received our Lord's answer, they had nothing to reply. His disciples perceiving their indignation,
                           came and asked Jesus if he observed they were scandalized, i.e. offended. It is probable the disciples were also a little
                           hurt, or afraid lest his words were contrary to the law of Moses or the tradition of the ancients, and took this occasion
                           of having their scruples removed. St. Hilary, St. Chrysostom and Theophylactus understand this answer, <I>Every plant, </I>&amp;c.
                           to signify that every doctrine not proceeding from God, consequently the traditions of the Pharisees here in question, were
                           to be eradicated by the promulgation of the gospel truths, which were not to remain unpublished on account of the scandal
                           some interested or prejudiced persons might choose to take therefrom. (Jansenius) --- It must be here observed, that Christ
                           was not the direct cause of scandal to the Jews, for such scandal would not be allowable; he only caused it indirectly, because
                           it was his doctrine, at which, through their own perversity, they took scandal. (Denis the Carthusian)</FONT></P><B>

                           if, through their own perversity, they choose to take scandal, let them do it; we must not neglect to teach the truth, though
                           it displease men. (St. Jerome) --- When, says St. Gregory, we see scandal arise from our preaching truth, we must rather suffer
                           it to take place than desert the truth. Our Lord says they are blind, let us leave them. For the land which has often been
                           watered with the dews of heaven, and still continues barren is deserted. Behold your house shall be left desolate. (Luke xiii.
                           35) And Isaias (v. 6.) says, It shall not be pruned, and it shall not be digged, but briers and thorns shall come upon it;
                           and I will command the clouds to rain no more rain upon it. For, although God never refuses man grace sufficient to enable
                           him to rise, if he pleases, yet he sometimes denies such assistance as would render his rise easy. The state of a sinner is
                           then desperate indeed, when Christ tells his disciples to leave him. For as the Sodomites were destroyed, so soon as Lot,
                           who was just and good in the sight of God, had departed from them, and as Jerusalem was laid waste when Jesus went out of
                           it, (for he suffered without the gates) so the sinner is in a very dangerous state, when he is left by the ministers of religion
                           as one infected with a mortal distemper. (Paulus de Palacio)</FONT></P><B>

                           countries? One reason may be, that our Saviour was not subject to the same rules he gave his disciples; another reason may
                           be brought, that he did not go then to preach; hence St. Matthew observes that he kept himself retired. (St. Chrysostom) ---
                           Tyre and Sidon were both situated on the Mediterranean sea, about 20 miles distant from each other, and the adjoining country
                           to the west and north of Galilee was called the coast or territories of Tyre and Sidon. The old inhabitants of this tract
                           were descendants of Chanaan, (for Sidon was his eldest son) and continued in possession of it much longer than they did of
                           any other part of the country. The Greeks called it Ph&#339;nicia; and when, by right of conquest, it became a province of
                           Syria, it took the name of <FONT size=3>Syroph&#339;nicia; hence the woman, whom St. Matthew calls a Chanaanite, St. Mark
                           calls a Syroph&#339;nician&nbsp;</FONT>and Gentile; as being both by religion and language a Greek.</FONT></P><B>

                           and him a man, whom she styles the Son of David. She lays no stress upon her own merits, but supplicates for the mercy of
                           God; neither does she say, have mercy on my daughter, but have mercy on me. ... To move him to compassion, she lays all her
                           grief and sorrow before him in these afflicting words: <I>my daughter is grievously afflicted by a devil.</I> (Glossa.)</FONT></P><B>

                           or whelp, is used in both these verses in the Septuagint. Our Lord crosses the wishes of the Chanaanæan, not that he intended
                           to reject her, but that he might bring to light the hidden and secret treasure of her virtue. Let us admire not only the greatness
                           of her faith, but likewise the profoundness of her humility; for when our Saviour called the Jews children, so far from being
                           envious of another's praise, she readily answers, and gives them the title of lords; and when Christ likened her to a dog,
                           she presently acknowledges the meanness of her condition. (St. Chrysostom, hom. liii.) He refused at first to listen to her
                           petition, says the same saint, to instruct us with what faith, humility, and perseverance we ought to pray. To make his servants
                           more sensible of his mercy, and more eager to obtain it, he often appears to pay no attention to their prayers, till he had
                           exercised them in the virtues of humility and patience. Ask, and you shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened to you.

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</font></p>
