                           <i>East,</i> looking towards Galaad, (Hadock) which the Syrians occupied. (Menochius) --- These actions were all significative
                           and prophetical. The throwing of a dart was formerly the mode of declaring war. (Virgil, Æneid ix.) Justin (ii.) says, "Alexander
                           first threw a javelin, as against a hostile country." Thus also the ancients took possession. (Varro) (V. Max. iii., &amp;c.)
                           The people of Andros and Chalcis, sent each a deputy to seize Acanthos, when it had been abandoned by its inhabitants. The
                           man from Andros, perceiving the other before him, threw his dart at the gate, and it was decided that he had thus lawfully
                           obtained possession. (Plutarch, q. Græc.; Selden, Mare. Claus. iv.) --- The action of Joas may be considered in both lights.
                           --- <i>Them.</i> We do not read the particulars of this battle: but it must have been very bloody. One of the three victories
                           (ver. 25.) of Joas was probably obtained at <i>Aphec,</i> (Calmet) a place memorable for the victory of Achab, over the same
                           Syrians, 3 Kings xx. 26. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Still.</i> This shewed a degree of remissness. (Haydock) --- It was natural for the king to conclude, that the more he
                           struck the earth, the greater would be his success; (Calmet) and the prophet had, perhaps, insinuated as much. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           God knows what would take place conditionally. (Tirinus) --- <i>If,</i> &amp;c. By this it appears, that God had revealed
                           to the prophet that the king should overcome the Syrians, as many times as he should then strike on the ground; but, as he
                           had not, at the same time, revealed to him how often the king would strike, the prophet was concerned to see that he struck
                           but thrice. (Challoner) --- Joas was assured that he should <i>consume</i> the Syrians. But this was to be understood, provided
                           he performed his part, (Menochius; Tirinus) and that destruction was not said to be entire. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Buried him,</i> near Samaria. (Menochius) --- He had been chosen by Elias sixty-eight years before, and had lived eleven
                           with him. His perfect character is given, Ecclesiasticus xlviii. 13. His double spirit represents the plentitude of grace
                           in Jesus Christ; as his raising of the child to life, in such a wonderful manner, denotes his incarnation. The waters of Jericho
                           made sweet, and the healing of Naaman, set before us the virtue of baptism: as the widow's oil shews the great graces which
                           are bestowed by Christ upon his Church. The children devoured, and the Syrians struck blind, remind us of the perversity and
                           blindness of infidels, who will not acknowledge the truth, Matthew xiii. 14. We must now see how the bones of Eliseus <i>prophesied:</i>
                           <b>1.</b> By raising the dead to life, as a confirmation of all his former predictions; <b>2.</b> as proof of a future resurrection,
                           of the virtue of relics, and of the influence of the saints in heaven, whose souls were formerly united to their bodies, and
                           were filled with the Holy Spirit; (St. Cyril of Jerusalem, cat. xviii. Illum.) <b>3.</b> in as much as this miracle was a
                           figure of Christ's resurrection, who raised himself to life, and those who believe in him: (Calmet) while Eliseus, in the
                           like state of death, had only raised another. (Haydock) (St. Max., hom. i. de pasc.) --- <i>Same.</i> Septuagint, Hebrew,
                           and Syriac, "at the coming in of the year;" (Haydock) or, "the next year." (Pagnin)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Eliseus.</i> His tomb was not in the city, but in a spacious cave, the entrance of which was secured with a stone, according
                           to custom. This was removed in the hurry, and the corpse thrown into the same recess, which had been prepared for the remains
                           of the prophet. Josephus ([Antiquities?] ix. 8.) relates the history in a different manner, and pretends that robbers having
                           slain a person, threw his corpse accidentally into the tomb of Eliseus. The Rabbins tell us his name was Sellum, and that
                           he died again immediately, because he was a wicked man, which would render the miracle, in a manner, useless. (Calmet) ---
                           By it God honoured his servant, and convinced the Israelites that what he had so lately foretold, respecting the Syrians,
                           would undoubtedly take place. (Menochius)</font></p><b>
