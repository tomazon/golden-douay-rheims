                           was brother of Amram; and, consequently, his son was the cousin of Moses. --- <I>Core</I> engaged the rest in his revolt.
                           Hebrew, "took or replied," interrupting Moses at the very time when he was speaking, in the name of God, and requiring that
                           he should shew, by what right he arrogated to himself alone that authority. "Core separated himself," Chaldean. "He retired,"
                           Syriac. "Core spoke....and Dathan....and they rose up," Septuagint. The Caathites encamped near the tribe of Ruben; and hence
                           Core had an opportunity to engage some of them in his revolt, by insinuating that Moses occupied the post in the state which
                           ought to belong to them, as Ruben was the first-born; while Aaron had obtained the high priesthood, and the rest of the Levites,
                           though of equal nobility, were to be treated as his servants. It is not known when this revolt happened. Some place it at
                           the camp of Sinai; others at that of Jetebata, Deuteronomy x. 8.</FONT></P><B>

                           up.</I> The crime of these men, which was punished in so remarkable a manner, was that of schism, and of rebellion against
                           the authority established by God in the Church; and their pretending to the priesthood without being lawfully called and sent:
                           the same is the case of all modern sectaries. (Challoner) --- Let them dread a similar punishment; not only the authors of
                           such wicked pretensions, but those also <I>who consent</I> to them, Romans i. 32. For we find that Core and all his adherents
                           were buried in hell; (ver. 33,) and those likewise who complained that their punishment was too severe, fell victims to the
                           raging fire, ver. 49. With what earnestness ought we not, therefore, to <I>contend for the faith once delivered to the saints!</I>
                           (Jude 3.) For if those be so severely punished who rise up in opposition to lawful superiors, either in church or state, what
                           swift destruction do they not bring upon their own heads who <I>deny God, who bought them,</I> and make him a liar, by calling
                           in question his most sacred truths? (2 Peter ii. 1.) (Haydock) --- Core and his companions impugned not the law directly,
                           but resisted Moses and Aaron. (St. Ignatius of Antioch, ep. ad Magnes.) They believed in the same God; yet, because they took
                           upon themselves to sacrifice, they were forthwith punished by God, and their unlawful sacrifices could do them no service.
                           (St. Cyprian, ep. i. 6.) Thus we are warned to keep in the true Church, and to obey those who are set over us; and never,
                           for any temporal consideration whatever, to encourage, by our presence, the sermons or meetings of heretics, or of schismatics,
                           lest we perish with them, ver. 26. (Worthington) --- <I>Assembly.</I> Hebrew, "famous in the assembly, men of name," and distinction,
                           senators. It seems Hom left the rest of the conspirators, as he is mentioned no more. The princes of Ruben were desirous of
                           obtaining the temporal power only. But the Levites aspired at that sacred pre-eminence, which had been given by God to Aaron
                           and his sons. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           It was not lawful for the Levites to offer incense: but they had prepared for themselves the ensigns of the priestly power,
                           and Moses permits them to try their success. (Haydock) --- They might have brought the censers, or broad plates, bowls, or
                           vials, (Apocalypse v. 8,) out of Egypt, where every family offers incense to their domestic gods and sacred animals. In Sicily
                           and Greece they were also very common, as well as at Babylon; where married people always purified themselves with the smoke
                           of incense. (Herodotus, i. 197.)</FONT></P><B>

                           These princes of Ruben were not desirous of the priesthood, as Core was; they repined, that Moses had got possession of the

                           See Psalm liv. 16., and Proverbs i. 12. "They were consigned to the tomb before they were dead," (St. Optatus, B. i.,) while
                           their impenitent souls were buried in hell. The souls of their infant children, which had no share in the rebellion, might
                           be exempted from the latter part of their punishment. (Calmet) --- If some have the rashness to blame the severity of this
                           judgment of God, let them shew the disparity between it and the various other accidents occasioned by earthquakes, &amp;c.,
                           which involve millions of such "smiling infants" in destruction; or, if they do not infer from these misfortunes, that the
                           laws of nature are unjust; neither ought they to conclude that the religion, delivered by God to Moses, was an imposture,
                           or that the Jewish legislator was cruel. He continued a silent spectator of this transaction, which he was informed by the
                           Spirit would surely take place, and could not be averted by his intercession, which had before rescued the less guilty multitude,
                           ver. 22. (Haydock) --- "They descend into hell alive; <I>that is,</I> feeling their own perdition, who, imitating Core,....separate
                           from the Church, and presently fall into heresy." (St. Augustine, ep. 93.)</FONT></P><B>
