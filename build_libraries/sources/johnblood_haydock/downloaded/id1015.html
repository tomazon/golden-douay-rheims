                           (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xi. 8.) --- Some think that the names of Jonathan and Jeddoa, and the ver. 22, 23, and 24, have
                           been inserted since the time of Nehemias; as he must have lived 140 years, to see the conquests of Alexander. (Tirinus; Petau;
                           N. Alex. T. 2 Dis. 7.) --- He could not be less than 20, when he returned in [the year of the world] 3550. Jaddus met Alexander
                           in 3672; consequently, at that time, Nehemias was 142 years old. But if he died at the commencement of the reign of Darius
                           Codomannus 3668, he would still be 138. (Calmet) --- Yet this longevity is by no means incredible, ver. 1., and chap. xiii.
