                           both in the preface to the Apocalypse, and sometimes in the annotations, that there are three ways of expounding all the visions
                           of this revelation, from the end of chap. iii. to the end of ver. 10. chap. xx. all of which seem grounded on the opinions
                           of the ancient Fathers. According to the first, all these visions are only to be fulfilled in antichrist's time, a little
                           before the end of the world. According to the second, the visions may be applied to particular events, which happened in the
                           first three or four ages[centuries], under the persecuting heathens, till by Constantine, and the succeeding Christian emperors,
                           idolatry by degrees was extirpated, and the faith of Christ triumphed over all its enemies, whether Jews or pagans. According
                           to the third, by the great city of Babylon, is mystically and metaphorically signified all wicked great cities in the world,
                           all the multitude of the wicked dispersed in all nations, their short and vain happiness, their persecutions and oppressions
                           of the good and faithful servants of God, who live piously in this world, and who are called to be citizens of the celestial
                           Jerusalem in the kingdom of God, where he reigneth for ever with his Angels and saints, and where they all reign with him,
                           happy in his sight and enjoyment. I am more and more inclined to this third exposition, by reading this 17th chapter, with
                           the contents of the 18th, 19th, and 20th chapters, till the 11th verse, and by reading what St. Jerome says in general terms,
                           in his epistle to Marcella, tom. 4, part 1, p. 166, Nov. edit. "<I>that all this book</I> (of the Apocalypse) <I>is either
                           to be expounded spiritually, or if we follow a carnal interpretation, we must content ourselves with Jewish fables.</I> And
                           especially by reading what St. Augustine has delivered us upon the chief difficulties of the Apocalypse, in his 20th book
                           de Civ. Dei[The City of God], from chap. vi. to chap. xvi. and from p. 578. to p. 594. tom. 7. Nov. edit. To expound then
                           these chapters together according to this third interpretation. (Witham) --- <I>Of the great harlot.</I> Nothing can be better
                           applied than this epithet to ancient Rome, which had conquered almost all the kingdoms of the known world, as it is said in
                           ver. 18., she <I>is the great city, a kingdom which hath dominion over the kings of the earth;</I> ver. 9., it was built upon
                           <I>seven mountains</I>; ver. 6., was watered with the blood of the saints and <I>martyrs of Jesus</I> Christ; and in fine,
                           ver. 5., it was the great <I>Babylon,</I> as St. Peter, in his first epistle, pleases to call it. (Calmet) --- <I>Come, I
                           will shew thee the condemnation of the great harlot,...Babylon....the mother of the fornications</I>. By this <I>harlot,</I>
                           and this <I>Babylon,</I> is signified the multitude of all the wicked of all times and places, who have abandoned themselves
                           to sensual pleasures, and sought for their happiness in riches and worldly grandeur; for this reason she is said to carry
                           on her forehead this inscription, <I>a mystery;</I> that is, to be understood in a mystical sense of all the wicked, who make
                           up as it were one city, as St. Augustine observes, which may be called <I>Babylon,</I> the city of confusion, the city of
                           idolatry, and of all manner of vices. --- <I>The beast,</I> that is, the devil, carries her, whose suggestions the wicked
                           follow. He comes out from <I>the bottomless pit.</I> <I>He was,</I> i.e. had a much greater and more extensive power over
                           the wicked world before Christ's coming and incarnation; <I>and he is not,</I> i.e. according to St. Augustine, his power
                           hath been much extenuated and lessened since that time. He is <I>bound</I> or chained <I>up for a thousand years,</I> as it
                           is said, chap. xx. 2. By which may be understood all the time from Christ's coming, and the establishing of his Christian
                           Church, till the last and severest persecution under antichrist. See St. Augustine, lib. xx. de Civ. Dei. chap. vii. And when
                           he shall come again, and be let loose, as it were, in antichrist's time, he must continue a short while: for all the ancient
                           fathers agree, by the interpretations they give to the Scripture, that antichrist, and consequently the devil with antichrist,
                           must reign but a short time. The <I>scarlet coloured beast,</I> the devil, called the prince of this world, on whom the <I>harlot
                           gilded with gold</I> sat; that is, all the wicked, and particularly all wicked kings and princes, with their worldly greatness,
                           who were <I>drunk with the wine of her prostitution;</I> that is, who abandoned themselves and indulged their passions with
                           all sensual pleasures, and contented themselves with the vain and deceitful happiness of this life; to be convinced of which,
                           the Angel is said to have taken St. John <I>in spirit into a wilderness</I> from the company of the wicked world, the better
                           to see and contemplate the vanity of their short and false happiness. This <I>woman</I>, this <I>harlot,</I> this <I>Babylon,</I>
                           this multitude of the wicked, especially the heathen persecuting emperors at Rome, and in all other places, (and they who
                           acted against the Christians under them) are said to be <I>drunk with the blood of the saints, and the blood of the martyrs,</I>
                           by putting the Christians, the Catholics and the servants of God to death, from the foundation of the world to its consummation,
                           by the instigation of the <I>beast,</I> the devil. The <I>beast,</I> the devil, is represented with <I>seven heads</I> and
                           <I>ten horns;</I> that is, with many heads and many horns, signified by the numbers <I>seven</I> and <I>ten.</I> See St. Augustine,
                           chap. xxiii. p. 606. --- <I>The seven heads,</I> as it is said, ver. 9, are seven mountains, and seven kings, i.e. a great
                           many. And also the <I>ten horns,</I> (ver. 12.) are ten kings. (Witham) </FONT></FONT></P><B>

                           Rome had notoriously polluted herself. For not content with worshipping her own heathenish gods, she adopted those of all
                           the countries and nations she had subdued. In Rome itself there were no less than 420 heathenish temples, so that one of their

                           Augustine that we do not know the meaning, than to advance suspicions and conjectures. But it is not improbable that by these
                           seven kings may be understood the collection of kings, in what are called the seven ages of the world, from its creations
                           to its consummation. The first age, is reckoned from Adam to Noe[Noah], and the deluge: the second age, from Noe to Abraham;
                           the third, from Abraham to Moses; the fourth, from Moses to David; the fifth, from David to Christ. These five were past,
                           and <I>fallen,</I> when St. John wrote. The sixth is, and is to last from Christ to antichrist. And another, the seventh,
                           <I>is not,</I> being the time of antichrist, and only a short time. See Cornelius a Lapide on this verse. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           all the wicked kings, who were to come after St. John wrote, to the end of the world, they had not yet kingdoms, but the kingdoms
                           which they should have, and all their vain happiness, would be very short, and at the same time they would be under the beast,

                           Totila, in 546, burnt it, and reduced it to a solitude. Procopius says he left not one human creature in the city. (Pastorini)

                           the beast:</I> the wicked reign under the prince of this world, the devil, as long as God pleases, and till his words and
                           judgments are fulfilled. All the contents of the following chapters agree with this exposition. When the Angel cries, (chap.
                           xviii.) <I>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen,</I> the false happiness of the wicked is come to its last period; though
                           St. John speaks sometimes by anticipation, especially when the rejoicings of the saints are represented, and the miseries
                           and consternation of the wicked, to encourage the servants of God to patience and perseverance under their trials and persecutions
                           in this mortal life. Babylon will in a short time be the habitation of devils: and therefore the good are admonished by these
                           words, <I>go out from her, my people,</I> avoid and detest her wicked ways. Almighty God hath remembered her iniquities, the
                           provocations of the wicked, nor can they escape the hand of his justice. They lived as if they were never to be called to
                           an account. Babylon, blinded with sensual delights, pride, and vanity, said in her heart, I sit as a queen above others, and
                           sorrow I shall not see; like the wicked in the psalmist, <I>who is Lord over us?</I> (Psalm xi.) But all her <I>plagues</I>
                           (chap. xviii. 8.) <I>come in one day,</I> at the day of death, or the day of judgment. Then are represented the weeping and
                           mourning of all the accomplices of the wicked, like the disappointment of merchants by the burning and destruction of a great
                           city, where they found so great profit in disposing and selling their merchandise. After this, in the 19th chapter, the blessed
                           in heaven sing <I>Alleluia,</I> &amp;c. the <I>God Almighty hath reigned,</I> or is about to reign. At the latter end of the
                           19th chapter, ver. 17, it is said, <I>I saw an Angel standing in the sun;</I> saying to all <I>the birds,</I> &amp;c. Here
                           are represented God's judgments on the wicked, as it were after a great battle, in which kings and many noblemen are slain,
                           so that the birds are invited to drink of their blood. --- <I>The beast was taken,</I> and <I>with him the false prophet.</I>
                           We may take this as spoken by anticipation of antichrist, and his great impostor, or false prophet. For still after this,
                           (chap. xx. 7.) is foretold, according to St. Augustine, the last persecution by the devil, and by antichrist with Gog and
                           Magog; for it is then that fire came down from heaven, and was to devour them; and there it is expressed that the devil, who
                           seduced them, and all the wicked, was cast into the lake of fire, into hell, where also the beast, antichrist, and the false
                           prophet shall be tormented for ever and ever. Now to give a short account of the two other expositions. The first of them,
                           followed by a great many, (as may be seen in Alcazar and Cornelius a Lapide) holds that all these visions will come to pass
                           in the short reign of antichrist, a little while before the end of the world. These interpreters are divided about the signification
                           of <I>Babylon:</I> some understand Babylon the metropolis of Chaldea, where they think that antichrist will begin to reign;
                           others understand Constantinople, the seat of the Turkish empire, which is also built upon seven hills: but many understand
                           Rome, not Christian Rome, but Rome that was a heathen city in the first ages[centuries], and which they think will be heathen
                           Rome again in antichrist's time. See a great number of the fathers and interpreters for this opinion cited by Cornelius a
                           Lapide. By the <I>beast</I> that carries her with her idolatry and vices, they understand the devil; and by the seven heads
                           and ten horns, kings, who shall be in the time of antichrist, and submit themselves to him. All these kings and persecutors
                           will receive their power one hour after, or with the beast, by which they rather understand antichrist, whose reign shall
                           be short, as shall be that of the devil, who shall be let loose, and have greater power for a little while. By the eighth,
                           who is of the seven, they understand the devil, because all the seven will be as it were his instruments. The same kings who
                           committed fornication with the harlot, are also said to hate her, and burn her, says Gagneius, by being the cause of her damnation
                           and destruction: for none are greater enemies than sinners' accomplices. As to the other exposition, (for which see Alcazar,
                           the bishop of Meaux[Bossuet], &amp;c.) they look upon all these visions till the last persecution under antichrist, (chap.
                           xx. 7. 10.) to be already fulfilled by the destruction of the heathen Roman empire, as they are also expounded by Dr. Hammond.
                           Babylon is the ancient heathen Rome, mother of fornication, i.e. of idolatry and of all kind of vices, sitting upon a scarlet
                           beast, supported by the pagan emperors in all their grandeur, pomp, and vanity. When it is said of her, <I>that she was, and
                           is not,</I> this is not to be taken with a regard to the visions one after another represented to St. John, nor with a regard
                           to the time when he wrote under Domitian. She is said to come again <I>out of the bottomless pit,</I> when the same heathen
                           worship was again renewed by Julian the apostate, who had a design and endeavoured to destroy the Christian religion. The
                           seven heads are ingeniously applied to Dioclesian, Maximian Herculeus, Constantius Chlorus, Maximus, and Maxentius, which
                           in a vision of St. John, are said to be the five that are fallen. One, to wit, Maximinus, is the sixth, represented as then
                           in being; and another, the seventh, it is said is not yet come; to wit, Licinius, whose persecution but a short time. The
                           eighth, who is called also one of the seven, they take to be Maximian Herculeus, who had laid down the empire with Dioclesian,
                           but took it up again, and so was the eighth, but of the seven mentioned before. The ten horns represented as not yet having
                           a kingdom, but who are to receive power as kings, one hour after the beast, or at the fall of the empire, are those kings
                           and princes by whom the Roman empire was destroyed; as the Goths, Vandals, Lombards, Burgundians, Franks, Huns, Alans, Suevi,
                           also Persians and Saracens, who invaded and dismembered different parts of the empire: but no great stress need be laid on
                           the exact number of&nbsp;<I>ten;</I> which, as St. Augustine says, may be taken for a great many. They all come with the same
                           design, (ver. 13.) to enrich and settle themselves in the dominions of the empire; yet afterwards they gave their power to
                           the beast, by entering into alliances with the emperors, as Alaric, the Goth, and others did. They at first fought with the
                           Lamb, being then heathens, and afterwards many of them Arians, till the Lamb overcame them, and brought them to the true Christian
                           faith. They are said to have hated the harlot, making her destitute by pillaging Rome and divers other cities: they devoured
                           her flesh, her treasures, God putting it into their hearts, making use of them as instruments to punish these wicked persecuting
                           idolaters; yet they afterwards sometimes agreed to give her their strength by agreements and alliances, till the time that
                           God decreed the empire should be in a manner destroyed. These interpreters conclude that by Babylon must necessarily be understood
                           Rome, because it is said that seven heads, upon which the woman sitteth, are seven mountains; and it is well known that Rome
                           is built upon seven hills; and secondly, because the woman is said to be the city, which hath dominion over the kings of the
                           earth. But first, those seven mountains are also called seven kings; secondly, Constantinople is also built upon seven hills;
                           thirdly, seven may be taken for many. And I cannot but take notice, that some expressions in this and in the next chapter,
                           seem to agree better with that exposition, which takes Babylon for the multitude of all the wicked: as when we read (chap.
                           xviii. 3.) that <I>all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication; </I>(ver. 23.) that <I>all nations</I>
                           were <I>deceived by</I> her <I>sorceries;</I> (ver. 24.) that <I>in her was formed the blood of the prophets, and of the saints,
                           and of all</I> that were <I>slain upon the earth.</I> For though the Roman empire was of so large an extent, yet a greater
                           part of the world was never subject to the Romans: many apostles and martyrs were not put to death at Rome, nor by the Romans,
                           but by the Persians, and in India, &amp;c. so these general expressions are more easily expounded, if by the great city of
                           Babylon we understand the multitude of the wicked in all parts of the world: not but that these visions may also regard heathen
                           Rome as the chief place where such persecutions were acted, and where all kind of vices were practices. --- N. B.[<EM>Nota
                           Bene,</EM> Note Well?]&nbsp;Some have taken notice, that the English Protestants print the 5th verse of this chapter in capital
                           letters: <I>Mystery Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth.</I> I will suppose that these
                           words are only printed in this manner, because they contain an inscription; as when it is said, that he who was called the
                           word of God, had written upon him, the <I>King of kings, and Lord of lords,</I> which words are also printed in great letters:
                           but if our adversaries do this, to make the Church of Rome to be looked upon as the whore of Babylon, and the pope as antichrist,
                           nothing can be more unfair, nothing more ridiculous, as I may shew on the following chapters. (Witham) </FONT></P></FONT><FONT
