                           should behold her. And," ver. 5. (Haydock) --- The fathers highly extol her virtue, and she was, no doubt, actuated by the
                           purest motives. Yet she might be guilty of some indiscretion. Even the working of miracles would not prove the contrary, as
                           wicked priests may confer the sacraments; and Moses was reprehensible the moment (Calmet) before (Haydock) he wrought a miracle,
                           Numbers xx. 10., and Matthew vii. 22. God inspired her with the laudable design of freeing her country, but the means were
                           left to her own choice. (Calmet) --- The making use of this rich attire was not, however, sinful in itself; and we have no
                           right to suspect that Judith gave any way either to vanity or to sensuality. How many ladies of quality are dressed so as
                           to enchant all those who are not upon their guard! Yet, provided they observe due modesty, who will blame their rich attire
                           or perfumes? (Haydock) --- Judith might lawfully desire to marry Holofernes for the good of her nation, (Menochius) as Esther
                           became the wife of Assuerus, though an infidel. The general seemed even willing to become a convert, chap. xi. 21. (Haydock)

                           seem hard to reconcile with truth. But all that is related in Scripture of the servants of God, is not approved by the Scripture:
                           and even the saints in their enterprizes may sometimes slip into venial sins. (Challoner) --- By means of mental reservations,
                           we may exculpate her from lying. (Serarius) (Menochius) --- But this expedient is bad and childish. (Haydock) --- She might
                           speak ironically, (Denis the Carthusian) or prophetically. (Raban. Glossa, &amp;c.) --- Still it might be an untruth, (Calmet)
                           to be excused, like stratagems in war. (Menochius) --- How often does an enemy give out that he is going to march to some

                           (Haydock) --- She spoke many things certainly true, and others which would probably have taken place, if God had not sent
