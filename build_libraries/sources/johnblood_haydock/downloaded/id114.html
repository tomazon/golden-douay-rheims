                           How comes it that Peter, after his conversion, should return to his fishing, when Jesus Christ had said, that he that sets
                           his hand to the plough, and looks back, is not worthy of the kingdom of heaven? The employments they applied to before their
                           conversion, without being guilty of sin, these they might, without fault, exercise, after their conversion: therefore Peter
                           returned to his fishing; but St. Matthew never returned to his custom-house, because when once converted, we never can be
                           allowed to give ourselves to these employments, which of themselves lead to sin. And there are many pursuits which can scarcely,
                           or not at all, be followed without sin. (St. Gregory, hom. xxiv. in Evan.)</font></p><b>

                           <i>This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples.</i> He had appeared to them more than thrice, even
                           the very day of his resurrection. (Matthew xxviii. 16.) Here it is called the third time either because it was the third different
                           day; or because it was the third time that he had then appeared to a considerable number together. After this, he appeared
                           to them frequently, and conversed with them for forty days, till his ascension. See Acts i. 3. and 1 Corinthians xv. 5. (Witham)
                           --- This must be understood of the third day, or of the third time, that our Saviour appeared to his apostles assembled: the
                           first day, being the day of his resurrection; the second, eight days after, when St. Thomas saw, and believed; and on this
                           day of their fishing. (St. Augustine, tract. 122. in Joan.) --- The evangelists relate ten different manifestations of our
                           Saviour, after his resurrection. First, he was seen by the women at the sepulchre; 2ndly, he was again seen by the same holy
                           women, returning from the sepulchre; 3rdly, by St. Peter; 4thly, by the two going to Emmaus; 5thly, by many at Jerusalem,
                           when Thomas was not with them; 6thly, at the time when St. Thomas saw him; 7thly, at the sea of Tiberias; 8thly, by the eleven,
                           on a mountain of Galilee, according to St. Matthew; 9thly, according to St. Mark, by the disciples, at their refreshment,
                           because he was going to sup with them no more; and 10thly, on the day of his ascension, raised from the earth into heaven.

                           <i>Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these?</i> That is, more than any one of these love me. Christ puts this question
                           thrice to St. Peter, that this triple protestation of love, says St. Augustine, might correspond to his triple denial. St.
                           Peter did not answer that he loved him more than the rest did, which he could not know, but modestly said: <i>yea, Lord, thou
                           knowest I love thee:</i> and the third time, <i>thou knowest all things,</i> and the hearts of all men, <i>thou knowest</i>
                           how much <i>I love thee.</i> At each protestation, Jesus answered, <i>feed my lambs;</i> and the third time, <i>feed my sheep.</i>
                           To feed, in the style of the Scriptures, is to guide, rule, and govern. St. Ambrose and some others take notice, as if by
                           the <i>lambs,</i> might be understood the people, and by the <i>sheep,</i> those placed over them, as bishops, priests, &amp;c.
                           but others make no such difference in this place, betwixt <i>lambs</i> and <i>sheep,</i> only as comprehending all the members
                           of Christ's Church, of what condition soever, even the rest of the apostles. For here it was that Christ gave to St. Peter
                           that power which he had promised him, (Matthew xvi. 18.) that is, He now made St. Peter head[2] of his whole Church, as he
                           had insinuated at the first meeting, when St. Andrew brought him to our Saviour, when he changed his name from Simon to Peter:
                           again, when he chose him, and made him the first of his twelve apostles; but particularly, when he said, <i>thou art Peter,</i>
                           (a rock) <i>and upon this rock will I build my Church,</i> &amp;c. Upon this account the Catholic Church, from the very first
                           ages, hath always reverenced, and acknowledged the supreme power of the successors of St. Peter, in spirituals, over all Christian
                           Churches. This appears also by the writings of Tertullian, of St. Irenæus, of St. Cyprian, of the greatest doctors and bishops,
                           both of the west and east, of St. Jerome, St. Augustine, of St. Chrysostom, in several places, of the first general Councils,
                           particularly of the great Council of Chalcedon, &amp;c. (Witham) --- <i>Simon</i> (son) <i>of John.</i> The father's name
                           is here added, to discriminate him from Simon Thaddeus, that every one might know that the chief care of the universal Church
                           was not given to any other apostle but Peter. This Simon of John is the same as Simon Bar-jona. See Matthew xvi. 17. (Menochius)
                           --- St. Peter had three times renounced his master; and Jesus, to give him an opportunity of repairing his fault by a triple
                           confession, three several times demanded of him, if he loved him more than these? That, as St. Augustine remarks, he who had
                           thrice denied through <i>fear</i> might thrice confess through <i>love.</i> (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           Jew or Gentile. St. Peter, by these words, is appointed to take charge of the whole flock, as being the chief and prince of
                           the apostles. He is, in some manner, the pastor, not of the sheep only, but of the pastors themselves. They have each their
                           own flock to look after; but to him is committed the care of all; he alone is the pastor of all. (Calmet) --- <i>Feed my sheep.</i>
                           Our Lord had promised the spiritual supremacy to St. Peter; (St. Matthew xvi. 19.) and here he fulfils that promise, by charging
                           him with the superintendency of all his sheep, without exception; and consequently of his whole flock, that is, of his whole
                           Church. (Challoner)</font></p><b>

                           be the instrument of his death and martyrdom. --- <i>Whither thou wouldst not:</i> which is no more than to say, that a violent
                           death is against the natural inclination of any man, even though he be ever so willing, and disposed to undergo it. (Witham)
                           --- By this is meant the martyrdom of St. Peter, which took place thirty-four years after this. He was first cast into prison,
                           and then led out to punishment as Christ had foretold him. He stretched out his arms to be chained, and again he stretched
                           them out, when he was crucified; for he died on the cross, as the ancients assure us. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Jesus saith: so I will have him remain,</i>[3] &amp;c. That is, in case I will have him remain; or, as it is in the Greek,
                           <i>if I will have him remain, what is</i> that to thee? It is thy duty, and thy concern, to follow me. (Witham) --- When Christ
                           told St. Peter to follow him, he meant, that he should go like himself to the death of the cross; but when he says of St.
                           John, So I will have him to remain till I come, he insinuates that his beloved disciple should not undergo a violent death;
                           but remain in the world, till he should visit him by death, and conduct him to glory. It may likewise be understood of the
                           Revelations, in which our Saviour manifested himself in his glory to this his beloved disciple. [Apocalypse i. 13.] In the
                           Greek, it is, <i>if I will have him to remain;</i> and this is the true reading, according to Estius, and Jansenius, bishop
                           of Ghent, authorized by many Latin copies. Others refer these words of Christ to his coming to destroy Jerusalem: an epoch
                           which St. John survived.</font></p><b>
