                           <P><STRONG>Notes &amp; Commentary:</STRONG></P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 1.</STRONG> <I>Remembered;</I> not as if God had ever forgotten Noe, but he now shews his remembrance of him
                           by the effects. (Menochius) --- <I>A wind,</I> literally <I>a spirit,</I> which St. Ambrose and Theodoret understood of the
                           Holy Ghost, that as he moved over the waters at first, (Chap. i. 2.) to give them fecundity, and to exercise his power in
                           establishing order, so he may shew the same care and providence for this new world, emerging, like the former, from the waters.
                           (Haydock) --- Most interpreters, however, understand this of a violent wind; (Proverbs xxv. 23; Exodus xiv. 21.) a strong
                           blast, such as was sent to divide the Red sea. (Menochius)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 3.</STRONG> <I>And the waters returned,</I> &amp;c. St. Jerome on this passage remarks, "that all waters and
                           torrents repair to the womb of the abyss, through the hidden veins of the earth," and by the abyss understands the sea: according
                           to that of Ecclesiastes i. 7, <I>all the rivers run into the sea.</I> But as the sea itself, on this occasion, exceeded its
                           limits, (otherwise its waters would not have been higher than the land) the sense perhaps confined to this, that the waters
                           by degrees were diminished; as we may say of the inundations of land, that the waters are gone off, not by the regular course
                           of ditches, but from the effects of the sun and winds which dry them up. (Estius)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 4.</STRONG> <I>And the ark rested on the mountains of Armenia.</I> The Hebrew word is <I>Ararat,</I> which
                           also occurs in the 37th chap. of Isaias, and the 51st of Jeremias; for in these places our interpreter retained the Hebrew
                           word, but in the 4th book of Kings, xix. 37, where the same history is related, it is translated <I>by the land of the Armenians.</I>
                           (Estius) --- <I>Seventh month,</I> of the year, not of the deluge, as appears from ver. 13, &amp;c. (Menochius). --- <I>Seven
                           and twentieth.</I> So also the Septuagint, but the Hebrew, &amp;c. have the 17th. It is not easy to decide which is right.
                           On the seventeenth the waters only began to decrease, and some hence argue for the Vulgate, as they say it is not probable
                           the ark would stop that very day. (Calmet) --- This, however, might be the only mean by which Noe could discern that the waters
                           were abating. (Haydock) --- The ark being about fourteen cubits sunk in the water, might soon touch the summit of the highest
                           mountains, such as Mount Taurus, of which the <I>Ararat,</I> here mentioned in the Hebrew, a mountain of <I>Armenia,</I> forms
                           a part, according to St. Jerome. The Armenians still boast that they have the remains of the ark. Berosus, the Pagan historian,
                           says bitumen was taken from it as a preservative. (Josephus, Antiquities i. 3; Eusebius, præp. ix. 4.) The Chaldee has Cordu
                           for Ararat, whence some have supposed, that the ark rested on the Cordyean or Gordiean mountains. The Armenians call the mountain
                           near Erivan, <I>Mesesonsar,</I> or the mountain of the ark. (Calmet)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 7.</STRONG> <I>Did not return.</I> The negotiation <I>Not,</I> is not to be found in any Hebrew copy now extant;
                           though it is still retained by the Septuagint, and several Latin manuscripts, according to the testimony of Liranus. If we
                           adhere, therefore, to the Hebrew text, we must translate it with St. Jerome, thus; <I>It went forth, going and returning,</I>
                           (<I>Egredicbatur exiens et revertens</I>) sometimes repairing to the mountains, where it found carcasses to feed on, and at
                           other times returning not <I>unto</I> the ark, but to rest upon the <I>top</I> of it. (Estius) (Challoner) --- Or receded
                           farther from it; as the Hebrew may be explained, agreeably to the Vulgate, Septuagint, Syriac, &amp;c. which admit the negation.
                           (Calmet) --- <I>Till,</I> as long as the waters covered the earth, not that it returned to the ark afterwards. (Menochius)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 9.</STRONG> <I>Whole earth,</I> excepting the mountains; so that the dove presently returned. (Haydock)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 11.</STRONG> <I>Green leaves.</I> The olive tree preserves its verdure and grows even at the bottom of the
                           Red sea, and other seas in the East. (Pliny, Natural History xii. 25.) --- Many other trees and seeds will live for a long
                           time under the waters. (Calmet) --- This tender branch of the olive seems to agree better with the spring than autumn; whence
                           Tirinus infers, that the deluge began and ended in spring.</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 13.</STRONG> <I>Year</I> of Noe's age, who, we may suppose, was born on the first day of the year. So that
                           his 601st year corresponds with the 1657th of the world, B.C. 2343, on which day the deluge ended. Still Noe waited for God's
                           order to leave the ark till the 27th of the ensuing month, when the earth was more perfectly dried. (Haydock) --- <I>Covering.</I>
                           Some think that the window was at the top, like a sky-light. (Calmet)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 17.</STRONG> <I>Increase.</I> Hebrew, "let them increase." This is spoken of the brute creation, the blessing
                           is given to men. (Chap. ix.) --- Neither Noe's family, nor any of the animals, had any young in the ark. (Calmet)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 20.</STRONG> <I>Holocausts,</I> or whole burnt offerings. In which the whole victim was consumed by fire upon
                           God's altar, and no part was reserved for the use of priest or people. (Challoner) --- This is the first time we read of an
                           altar, though Abel had surely made use of one. (Menochius) --- Noe delays not to shew his gratitude to God, St. Ambrose. (Worthington)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 21.</STRONG> <I>Smelled,</I> &amp;c. A figurative expression, denoting that God was pleased with the sacrifices
                           which his servant offered, (Challoner) and in this sense it is expressed in the Chaldee, "God received his offering gratefully."
                           God requires sacrifices of us, to testify his dominion, and not for any advantage he derives from them; but rather to bless
                           us, if we perform our duty with fervour. --- <EM>For the sake</EM> of, or on account of men's sins. They are so prone to evil,
                           that, if I were to punish them as often as they deserve, new deluges might be sent every day. I take pity on their weakness.
                           I will punish the most criminal, but not as I have done, by cursing the earth. These words of God, are by some addressed to
                           Noe, by others to God the Son. Hebrew, "he said to his heart;" Onkelos, "he said in his word;" Septuagint, "he said with reflection."
                           (Calmet) --- Noe was beloved by God, and therefore may be called his heart. To speak to the heart, often means to comfort.
                           (Haydock)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 22.</STRONG> <I>Seed-time,</I> according to the Targum of Jonathan, is the equinox of September; <I>harvest,</I>
                           that of March; winter and summer denote the solstice of December and of June. But the Hebrews probably divided the year into
                           summer and winter; or perhaps they might also admit the season of spring, with the Egyptians and the ancient Greeks, who represented
                           the seasons by the three hours, daughters of Jupiter. (Calmet)</P></FONT></FONT></FONT>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 Which went forth and did not return, till the waters were dried up

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 But she not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him into
                                    the ark: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And she came to him in the evening carrying a bough of an olive tree,
