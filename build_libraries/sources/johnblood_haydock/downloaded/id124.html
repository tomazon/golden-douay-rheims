                           and instructed, yet was sent to a man to receive the sacraments, and to be joined to the Church." (De Doct. Chris. lib. i.

                           x. 44.) (Witham) --- This imposition of hands, was not the same as that, by which the faithful were confirmed, or ordained
                           ministers, but a ceremony commonly used by the apostles to restore health to the sick. If Saul, in consequence, receives the

                           him, for becoming a Christian; and the brethren saved his life, by conveying him down the walls of the town in a basket. After
                           this, he went to Jerusalem, where the disciples knew little of him, and were afraid of him, till St. Barnabas introduced him

                           the dead to life can only be the work of God. This woman was raised to life for the comfort of the faithful, and the conversion
                           of others. She herself might likewise have an opportunity of acquiring greater merit, otherwise the repose of another life
                           is preferable to a return to the miseries of this world. (Denis the Carthusian)</FONT></P><B>
