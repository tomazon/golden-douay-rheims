                           that their temple might be dedicated to the Greek Jupiter. (Josephus, Antiquities xii. 7.) --- Yet Epiphanes chose "the Hospitaller."
                           (Calmet) --- Sannaballat procured this temple to be erected in the days of Alexander; and Ananias built another in Egypt,
                           under Philometor. Both were schismatical. (Josephus, Antiquities xi. 8., and xv. 6. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 For the temple was full of the riot and revellings of the Gentiles:

                                    the walls.</font></p>

                                    And now we must come to the narration.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Eleazar, one of the chief of the scribes, a man advanced in years,
                                    and of a comely countenance, was pressed to open his mouth to eat swine's flesh.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 But he, choosing rather a most glorious death than a hateful life,
                                    went forward voluntarily to the torment.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And considering in what manner he was come to it, patiently bearing,
                                    he determined not to do any unlawful things for the love of life.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 But they that stood by, being moved with wicked pity, for the old
                                    friendship they had with the man, taking him aside, desired that flesh might be brought, which it was lawful for him to eat,
                                    that he might make as if he had eaten, as the king had commanded, of the flesh of the sacrifice:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 That by so doing he might be delivered from death; and for the sake
                                    of their old friendship with the man, they did him this courtesy.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 But he began to consider the dignity of his age, and his ancient years,
                                    and the inbred honour of his grey head, and his good life and conversation from a child; and he answered without delay, according
                                    to the ordinances of the holy law made by God, saying, that he would rather be sent into the other world.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 For it doth not become our age, said he, to dissemble: whereby many
                                    young persons might think that Eleazar, at the age of fourscore and ten years, was gone over to the life of the heathens:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And so they, through my dissimulation, and for a little time of a
                                    corruptible life, should be deceived, and hereby I should bring a stain and a curse upon my old age.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 For though, for the present time, I should be delivered from the punishments
                                    of men, yet should I not escape the hand of the Almighty neither alive nor dead.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 Wherefore, by departing manfully out of this life, I shall shew myself
                                    worthy of my old age:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And I shall leave an example of fortitude to young men, if with a
                                    ready mind and constancy I suffer an honourable death, for the most venerable and most holy laws. And having spoken thus,
                                    he was forthwith carried to execution.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And they that led him, and had been a little before more mild, were
                                    changed to wrath for the words he had spoken, which they thought were uttered out of arrogancy.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 But when he was now ready to die with the stripes, he groaned, and
                                    said: O Lord, who hast the holy knowledge, thou knowest manifestly that whereas I might be delivered from death, I suffer
                                    grevious pains in body: but in soul am well content to suffer these things, because I fear thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 Thus did this man die, leaving not only to young men, but also to
                                    the whole nation, the memory of his death, for an example of virtue and fortitude.</font></p>
