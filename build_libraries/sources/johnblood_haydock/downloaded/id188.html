                           to set in a true light his apostolical authority, the favours he had received from God, his actions, his labours, and his
                           sufferings, with an apology for mentioning them, giving all the glory to God. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           appearances, and <I>my speech contemptible,</I> without the ornaments of human eloquence, but am said to <I>be bold</I> when

                           make use of my authority, nor of those spiritual arms and weapons, of censures and excommunications, nor perhaps of exemplary
                           punishments, which God sometimes in a miraculous manner shewed by his apostles. See the examples of Ananias and Saphira struck
                           dead at St. Peter's words, (Acts v.) of Elymas struck with blindness for opposing St. Paul's preaching. (Acts xiii.) He puts
                           them in mind, that the power, which God has given to his apostles, is so great and prevalent, that no force upon earth has
                           been able to resist or hinder the designs of God, as to the spreading of the gospel, and the faith of Christ, and as he expresseth
                           it, to the <I>destruction of fortifications, we subverting counsels,</I> and every thing that opposed the <I>knowledge of
                           God,</I> who reduceth whom he pleaseth to the <I>obedience of Christ.</I> He admonishes them all to return to the obedience
                           due to him, and the true ministers of the gospel, lest he be obliged to revenge, that is, punish such as remain disobedient.
                           He acknowledges that his apostolical power was given him for the good and <I>edification</I> of the faithful, not for their
                           <I>destruction,</I> which he will take care not to abuse. In fine, he tells them here in short, and more at large in the following
                           chapter, that they may, if they please, consider outward appearances, his apostolical functions, the miracles God has wrought
                           in his favour, what he has done, and suffered, by which will appear the advantages he has above his adversaries, who spoke
                           with contempt of him. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           I have abused, and usurped over you. There is in this discourse a little irony against the facility with which the Corinthians
                           heard the enemies of St. Paul. He alludes to those false teachers who decried his doctrine, by preaching up the observance
                           of the ceremonial parts of the law, for they were Jews, and had introduced many new practices into the Church. We may here
                           take notice, that these observations are applicable to the epistles of St. Paul to the Galatians, and Philippians, for they
                           are the same false teachers whom he there attacks, and who accused St. Paul of being a hypocrite, a seducer, in a word, one
                           who walked according to the flesh. (Estius and St. Chrysostom)</FONT></P><B>

                           reduce every height, or high-minded philosopher, to the obedience of Christ. (Calmet) --- Hence doth our Saviour pray, "I

                           he says, your obedience must first be fulfilled. God forbid that I should first use the sword, before I have tried the ways
                           of sweetness and conciliation. But if any remain obstinate, then I will employ the arms that God has given me. (Grotius) ---
                           This sweet and forcible example of the apostle is worthy the imitation of all superiors, temporal and ecclesiastical, how

                           The following verses to the end of the chapter, are equally obscure, both in the Greek and Latin text. --- <I>We dare not
                           rank or compare ourselves,</I> &amp;c. He seems to write this ironically, by way of mocking at those, who commended and preferred
                           themselves before others. But I will not compare myself with others, but will only <I>compare</I> [2] myself with myself,
                           to shew that my actions agree with my words and my letters. --- <I>We will not glory beyond our measure, but according to
                           the measure of the rule which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even to you.</I> Here he speaks of a measure, and
                           a rule. By the measure, with which God measured <I>to him,</I> he means the places and countries, in which he, and the other
                           apostles were appointed to preach, and plant the gospel: and by the <I>rule</I> also prescribed him, he means that it was
                           given him as a rule not to preach, where other ministers of Christ had preached. When he says, therefore, <I>we will not glory
                           beyond our measure,</I>[3] or (as it is implied in the Greek) of things <I>out of the measure,</I> the sense is, I will not,
                           like false preachers, pretend to have preached in places out of my province, or which were not measured out to me, nor have
                           we <I>extended</I> ourselves farther than we ought to have done, when we came to you, for you were within our measure. Nor
                           have I transgressed the <I>rule,</I> because others had not preached to you before me, so that I have not <I>boasted in other
                           men's labours.</I> But as your faith is growing, and increasing, when I have sufficiently settled the gospel among you, I
                           hope my measure may <I>be enlarged,</I> and that without breaking the settled rule, I may preach also to people and <I>places
                           beyond you.</I> This is what seems to be understood by these words, to be <I>enlarged</I> or <I>magnified,</I> even <I>to
                           an abundance,</I> and yet not to glory in other men's labours, but to glory in the Lord only, and in what we do, as we have
                           been directed, and assisted by him. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>
