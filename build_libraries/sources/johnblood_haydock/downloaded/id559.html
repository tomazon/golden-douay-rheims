                           Israel.</I> There seems no reason for restricting this to the <I>ancients,</I> &amp;c. On this solemn occasion, when all Israel
                           was probably assembled at one of the great festivals, Josue concluded his exhortation, by renewing the covenant (Calmet) in
                           the place where he had formerly complied with the injunction of Moses, chap. viii. 31. (Haydock) --- <I>In Sichem,</I> in
                           the field which Jacob had purchased, and where a great <I>oak</I> (ver. 26,) was growing, that had been honoured, it is thought,
                           with the presence of the patriarchs. It was near the two famous mountains of Garizim and Hebal. (Calmet) --- Sichem was at
                           the foot of the former mountain of blessings; and Josephus informs us, the altar was erected in its vicinity. No fitter place
                           could therefore have been selected by the aged chief, to conclude the actions of his life, and to attach the people to the
                           religion which they had once received, in the most signal manner. The Vatican and Alexandrian copies (Haydock) of the Septuagint,
                           followed by St. Augustine (q. 30,) read Silo, where the tabernacle was fixed: but all the rest agree with the original, and
                           with the ancient versions, in retaining Sichem, to which place the ark was removed on this occasion, (Calmet) the distance
                           of ten (St. Jerome) or twelve miles. (Eusebius) --- It is not probable that an oak would be growing in the sanctuary, near
                           the altar, contrary to the express prohibition of the Lord, ver. 26., and Deuteronomy xvi. 21. (Calmet) --- Many interpreters
                           suppose that the assembly might be held at Silo, in the territory of Sichem. (Tirinus; Menochius; Serarius) --- But the distance
                           seems too great; and Bonfrere rather thinks that the copies of the Septuagint have been altered. (Haydock) --- Salien remarks,
                           that they might go in solemn procession from Sichem to Silo. (In the year of the world 2600)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew, "the masters of Jericho," which may denote either the king or the inhabitants. It is thought that people of the different
                           nations were come to defend the city, or the text may signify that not only Jericho, but these different people, (Calmet)
                           fought successively against the people of God, but all in vain. (Haydock) --- The fighting of the inhabitants of Jericho was
                           only intentional; a miracle rendered all their efforts abortive. Yet this is called fighting in scripture (ver. 9,) as well
                           as in other authors. "We judge of actions by the intention, says St. Isidore: (Pelus. ii. ep. 289,) the person who intended
                           to murder is punished, though he only inflicted a wound; and on the other hand, he who dills undesignedly receives a pardon."
                           So Orion was said to have violated Diana, because he wished to do it; and Virgil, (Æneid viii.) speaking of some who already
                           thought they were in possession of the capital, says, <I>Galli per dumos aderant, arcemque tenebant,</I> "they seized the
                           citadel," though they never entered it. (Calmet) --- Yet it is probable that the inhabitants of Jericho would defend themselves.

                           St. Augustine explains this of the rumours, or devils, which terrified the people of the country. But it is generally understood
                           literally, Wisdom xii. 8. (Menochius) (Exodus xxiii. 28.) (Calmet) --- <I>The two,</I> &amp;c., not only the nations on the
                           west, but also those on the east side of the Jordan, who fell, not so much by the valour of the Israelites, as by the terror
                           and judgments of God. (Haydock) --- The resistance which they made was hardly worth mentioning.</FONT></P><B>

                           gods.</I> Some still retained in their hearts an affection for these idols, though privately; (Calmet) so that Josue could
                           not convict them, or bring them to condign punishment; as no doubt he, and Moses before him, would have done, if they had
                           been apprized of any overt act of idolatry. Amos (v. 26,) says, <I>You carried a tabernacle for your Moloch and the image
                           of your idols,</I> &amp;c., which is confirmed by Ezechiel xxiii. 3, 8., and Acts vii. 42. For these acts many of the people
                           were punished, (Numbers xxv. 3, 9,) and the rest were either sincerely converted, or took care to hide their impiety till
                           after the death of Josue. Yet the secret inclination of many was still corrupt; and these no sooner found a proper opportunity
                           than they relapsed repeatedly into the worship of idols, for which reason the prophets represent their disposition as criminal
                           from their <I>youth.</I> (Haydock) --- St. Augustine (q. 29,) cannot think that the people, who are so often praised for their
                           fidelity during the administration of Josue and of the ancients, (chap. xxii. 2., and xxiii. 3, 8., and xxiv. 31,) and who
                           had testified such zeal against every appearance of idolatry in Ruben, (chap. xxii.) should be themselves infected with this
                           deadly poison. He therefore supposes that Josue exhorts them to repent, if any of them should have retained a predilection
                           for the worship of their ancestors in Mesopotamia, and in Egypt, (Calmet) which, by the prophetic light he saw, was secretly
                           the case. (Worthington) --- Yet, though the great majority was clear of this crime, it seems many concealed from their leaders
                           their secret attachment to it, ver. 23; (Calmet) or if they were sincere, for a time, their former bad habits soon gained
                           the ascendancy, and involved them in perdition. (Haydock) --- <I>Fathers.</I> He does not exempt Abraham, and the Jews acknowledge
                           that he was once an idolater, which is the opinion of St. Ephrem, of the author of the Recognitions, B. i., and of many moderns;
                           some of whom think that St. Paul gives him the epithet of impious, or <I>ungodly,</I> on that account, Romans iv. 5. The idolatry
                           of the Hebrews in Egypt, is no less certain than that of their ancestors in Mesopotamia, Ezechiel xxiii. 2, 8, 27. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Josue was persuaded that no restraint could bind the will; (Haydock) and that, if the Israelites did not freely adhere to
                           the Lord, they would not serve him long, nor would their adoration have any merit. (Calmet) --- Hence he endeavours by all
                           means to draw from them a free and candid acknowledgment of his divinity; and he leads the way, by declaring that all his
                           <I>house</I> will adhere to the true and only God. They answer his fullest expectations, and profess in the most cordial manner,
                           that every tie of gratitude must bind them for ever to the service of the same Lord. (Haydock) --- Elias makes a similar proposition;
                           (3 Kings xviii. 21. See Ecclesiasticus xv. 18.; Menochius) not that it can be ever lawful to choose evil and to reject the
                           sovereign good. But by this method the minds and hearts of the audience are stimulated to make the free and decided election
                           of what alone can ensure their eternal happiness. (Haydock) --- Thus we often set before the people hell or heaven for their
                           choice. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           will not be able to serve the Lord,</I> &amp;c. This was not said by way of discouraging them; but rather to make them more
                           earnest and resolute, by setting before them the greatness of the undertaking, and the courage and constancy necessary to
                           go through with it. (Challoner) --- Josue knew the fickle temper of his subjects. He insinuates, therefore, that if they do
                           not lay that aside, they will not stand to their engagements, (Calmet) and will irritate God the more, if they enter into
                           a covenant with him, and afterwards prove inconsistent. Hebrew <I>La thuclu,</I> "you cannot," may perhaps have the first
                           <I>u</I> redundant; (Kennicott) as that is a letter which is often inserted or omitted at the transcriber's pleasure. (Aben
                           Ezra. Simon) --- Hallet suggests that we ought to read <I>lo thucelu,</I> "you shall not cease," which would obviate the apparent
                           difficulty of Josue's attempting, as it were, to cool the fervour of the people, by insinuating that they will not be able
                           to stick to their resolutions, and that at a time when he is exerting every nerve to make them sensible of their duty, and
                           to engage them to swear an inviolable fidelity to the Lord. "Cease not to serve the Lord, for he is a holy God, he is a jealous

                           and serve strange gods, then he will turn and consume you." (Kennicott, Dis. 2.) --- If we were to read with an interrogation,
                           "Will you not be able? &amp;c., it might answer the same end. Josue may be considered as starting an objection, which is but
                           too common in the mouth of the slothful, and of many of the pretended reformers, Luther, &amp;c., who endeavour to persuade
                           the world that they are not able to comply with the rigour of God's law, and even make his severity an encouragement for their
                           despair. Josue replies that these pretexts are groundless, and that God, who has already done so much for them, (ver. 20,)
                           will not abandon them in their wants, if they cry unto him; and that, instead of being dejected by the thought of his judgments,
                           they ought to strive, with the utmost fervour, to comply with his divine will. (Haydock) --- A general sometimes withholds
                           the ardour of his soldiers, telling them that they are not a match for the enemy, in order to inflame their courage the more.
                           (Menochius) --- A torrent which has been long repressed, rushes forward with greater fury when the dam is broken down. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           (Haydock) and by the Septuagint here. But most people translate <I>the oak.</I> (Chaldean; Aquila; &amp;c.) Under it Jacob
                           buried the idols of Laban, and Abimelech was chosen king; (Judges ix. 6,) as Abraham had entertained the angels under the
                           same tree, Genesis xviii. 1., (Calmet) and had sat under it when he first came into Sichem, Genesis xii. 6. On which supposition
                           it must have subsisted about 500 years. (Menochius) --- It was even shewn some ages after Christ. But it is hardly credible
                           that the same tree should have continued for such a length of time. --- <I>Sanctuary,</I> or tent, where the ark was placed
                           on this occasion under the oak. (Calmet; Bonfrere) --- Some think it was at Silo. (Menochius; ver. 1.) --- Kennicott denies
                           that the ark was present, and supposes that they offered sacrifice upon the very altar which Josue had erected on Garizim,
                           between 20 and 30 years before; and that this mountain is here called <I>the sanctuary</I> or "holy place." Upon it the <I>oak</I>
                           might very well grow, and Josue might "with great propriety take some large stone, and set it up for a witness, making at
                           the same time this striking remark, that this stone <I>had heard all the words of the Lord,</I> or had been present when his
                           law was inscribed and read to the people at their former solemn convention." Hence he infers against Collins, "that the Jews
                           had thoughts of worshipping, and did worship at Gerizim long before the separation of Israel from Juda;" and it was probably
                           for fear of the Israelites returning to a sense of their duty, by the sight of these monuments of the old religion, that Jeroboam
                           refrained from setting up his golden calves in the vicinity. (Diss. ii. p. 119.) (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           he died] probably not long after the ratification of the covenant. It does not appear that he was ever married. (St. Jerome,
                           contra Jov. 1.; St Chrysostom) --- The Scripture does not mention that the people mourned for him, as they had done for Moses,
                           &amp;c. Yet we cannot doubt but they would shew this mark of respect to his memory, on account of the many benefits which
                           they had received from him. The Holy Ghost has vouchsafed to be his panegyrist, Numbers xxvii. 12., and Ecclesiasticus xlvi.
                           1., &amp;c. Josephus ([Antiquities?] v. 1,) represents him as a most universal character, equally perfect in every thing that
                           he took in hand. His greatest honour is to have been so striking a figure of Jesus, whose name he bore, (Calmet) and whose
                           sacred office in administering a second circumcision after he had caused the people to cross the Jordan, he so well described.
                           Like him he introduces the faithful into the land of promise, overthrows their enemies, and establishes them in peace, taking
                           care both at the beginning and at the end of his administration, to set before their eyes the will of the heavenly Father,
                           the God who is both holy and jealous, ver. 19. Under Josue the Israelites are invincible, only as long as they continue faithful,
                           chap. vii. But Jesus secures his Church both from infidelity and from the attacks of all her enemies, by his all-powerful
                           grace. (Haydock) --- The Jews have attributed to Josue ten regulations, which are too trifling to have been made by him. (Selden,
                           Jur. vi. 2.) --- The Samaritan chronicle embellishes the account of this great man with many surprising and puerile fictions,
                           as if the true history were not sufficient to excite our attention. See Basnage and Serarius. (Calmet) --- The Jews say Josue
                           died on the 26th of Nisan, unmarried. The Roman martyrology honours his memory on the 1st of September. (Salien, in the year
                           before Christ 1453.) It is probable that the Egyptian or Tyrean Hercules, who encountered so many giants and difficulties,
                           was no other than Josue, whose history the pagans have obscured with fables. (Vossius.) (Haydock) </FONT></P><B>

                           had exchanged their places. And may we not allow the same in this part of the sacred history, as it is universally printed"
                           in Hebrew? (Dis. i.) Some, however, maintain that <I>Thamnath hares</I> was so called, on account of "the image of the sun"
                           being placed in the tomb of Josue, along with the knives of stone used by him in circumcision, which last the Septuagint and
                           St. Augustine (q. 30,) admit. But these must be reckoned among the Jewish or Oriental fables, (Calmet) though it is not improbable
                           but the circumcising knives might be thus preserved, as a monument of the covenant made with the Israelites. (Haydock) ---

                           the second high priest, was succeeded by his son <I>Phinees.</I> They were both of a very unexceptionable character. The Holy
                           Ghost says, (Ecclesiasticus xlv. 28,) <I>Phinees, the son of Eleazar, is the third in glory, by imitating him</I> (his father
                           or grandfather) <I>in the fear of the Lord,</I> &amp;c. The Jews seem to have adopted the doctrine of Pythagoras, with respect
                           to Phinees, (Haydock) as they say that he was the man of God, (3 Kings ii. 27,) who appeared to Heli, (Trad. Heb. in Reg.)
                           and that he was consulted by Jephte, and gave him advice to fulfil his vow; that he was the same person with Elias, and with
                           one Phinees, who returned from the captivity with Esdras, 1 Paralipomenon ix. 20. They will even have him to be an incarnate
                           angel. (Ap. Munster, &amp;c.) But without dwelling any longer on these fabulous accounts, (Calmet) he was surely a man of
                           the greatest zeal and piety. (Haydock) --- In consideration of his extraordinary merit, the city of Gabaath was given to him,
                           though it was not properly a sacerdotal city, and priests could not regularly possess any land as their inheritance. Grotius
                           supposes that he obtained this city along with his wife, as she was an heiress of the tribe of Ephraim. But if that had been
                           the case, must she not have married some of the same tribe? Numbers xxxvi. 8. (Calmet) --- Septuagint (Grabe) add, "In that
                           day the children of Israel taking the ark of the covenant of God, carried it about among themselves, and Phinees was priest
                           instead of his father, till he died, and he was buried in Gabaath, his own city. But the Israelites went each to his own place
                           and city; and the children of Israel worshipped Astarte and Asteroth, and the gods of the surrounding nations, and the Lord
                           delivered them into the hands of Eglon, the king of Moab, and he held them in subjection 18 years." See Judges iii. 12, 14.
                           Why this is recorded in this place does not appear, unless it be to insinuate that the servitude under Eglon did not commence
                           till after the death of Phinees, who had been high priest 40 years. Abisue, his son, entered upon the pontificate in the first
                           year of the administration of Aod, 1 Paralipomenon vi. 4, 50. (Salien, in the year of the world 2641, in the year before Christ
                           1412.) Josue and Eleazar had reigned nearly during the same period of time, and finished their course together. They had assisted
                           each other in keeping the people of God under due restraint. Their successors in office acted with the like zeal and concord,
                           though they were not quite so successful. It is probable that Phinees would have the chief sway in "the aristocracy" of the
                           <I>ancients,</I> which Josephus says took place between Josue and Othoniel. Their government is acknowledged by most authors,
                           though Salien supposes that their authority, as distinct from the Sanhedrim, consisted in giving good example. Many assert
                           that Phinees ruled the people twenty-three years. (Haydock)</FONT></P>
