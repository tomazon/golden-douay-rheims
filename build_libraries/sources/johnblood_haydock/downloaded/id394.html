                           All the Oriental languages express these birds by <I>solaem,</I> though some have asserted, that pheasants or locusts are
                           here meant. Josephus (Antiquities iii. 1) informs us, that great flocks of quails are found about the gulph of Arabia. They
                           return to Europe from the warmer regions, about the beginning of May, at which time God directed the course of vast multitudes
                           to the camp of Israel. Hesychius says, the chennion, a smaller species of quails, was salted and dried, as the Hebrews did
                           theirs, Numbers xi. 32. See Psalm lxxvii. 26. (Calmet) --- <I>Dew,</I> upon which lay the miraculous bread, around the camp.
                           None fell within, as the place was not sufficiently clean. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           St. Jerome adds the explanation, (Du Hamel) which is almost universally adopted, though some pretend that <I>man,</I> even
                           in Chaldean, means <I>who,</I> and not <I>what?</I> Calmet refers them to Psalm lx. 7, for a proof of the contrary. Manna
                           is found in various parts of the world, the best in Arabia. But this was of a different nature, and wholly miraculous, falling
                           every day, except Saturday, throughout the 40 years that the Hebrews dwelt in the desert. It melted with the heat of the sun,
                           (ver. 21,) though it would bear the fire, and might be made into cakes, which cannot be done with the Arabian manna. It filled
                           the mouth of God's servants with the most delightful tastes, (Wisdom xvi. 20,) while the wicked were disgusted with it, Numbers
                           xi. 6. --- <I>Our soul is dry,</I> &amp;c. It is called the bread of angels, being made or brought by their ministry, and
                           of such a quality, that they would desire nothing better, if they stood in need of food. (Calmet) --- Whatever a man gathered,
                           he had only a gomor full, and this sufficed for young and old, sick and healthy; if any was kept over the night it became
                           corrupt, except that which was reserved for Saturday, and that which was preserved in the ark for a memorial for several hundred
                           years. (Worthington) --- Yet this wonderful bread was only a figure of that which Jesus Christ promised to give, (St. John
                           vi.) and as the figure must come beneath the reality, (Colossians. ii.) what we receive in the blessed Eucharist, must undoubtedly
                           be something better than manna. Would Zuinglius and Calvin attempt then to persuade us, that Christ appointed their mere sacramental
                           <I>bread,</I> to supersede and excel the favour of manna granted to the fathers, who are dead? Mere bread cannot stand in
                           competition with this miraculous food. But the truth which it foreshewed, according to all the doctors of the Church, I mean
                           the body and blood, soul and divinity of Jesus Christ, in the blessed sacrament, under the appearances of bread and wine,
                           are surely more excellent than manna itself. It is miraculously brought upon our altars by the words of Jesus Christ, spoken
                           by his priests at Mass, and dispensed to infinite multitudes, in the most distant places from each other, and even in the
                           smallest particle. (Haydock) --- It giveth grace in this life, and glory in the next, and this in proportion to each one's
                           disposition. To the wicked it may appear contemptible, but to the servants of God it is the most delightful and <I>supersubstantial.</I>
                           (Worthington) --- Button allows that the Protestant version of this verse "seems to make Moses guilty of a contradiction.
                           <I>It is manna, for they wist not what it was.</I> But the Septuagint (he might add the Vulgate also) translate it according
                           to the original." (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Manna was withdrawn as soon as usual food could be easily procured. (Haydock) --- In this desert of the world, we are supported
                           by the sacraments. As manna fell in the night, so the mysteries of faith are concealed from the curious researches of men.
                           It melted with the sun beams; so mysteries confound the idle attempts of those who would fathom their impenetrable depth.
