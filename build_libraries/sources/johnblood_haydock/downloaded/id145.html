                           that he was separated from others, and appointed by the Holy Ghost to preach the gospel, as we read Acts xiii. 2. when the
                           Holy Ghost to those of the Church at Antioch, said, <i>Separate me Saul and Barnabas, for the work unto which I have taken

                           his Son, both as God, and also as man. (Witham) --- The Greek text has not the particle <i>ei,</i> (to him) but only&nbsp;<i><u>tou
                           genomenou ek spermatos David</u>.</i> But St. Irenæus, (lib. iii. chap. 18.) St. Ambrose, St. Jerome read, Qui factus est

                           (lib. xi. chap. 14.) he reads it otherwise. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           disciples, during his life-time, to preach to any other nation. And after his resurrection, when they had full powers to preach
                           every where, they did not turn to the Gentiles, till the Jews had refused to hear them. A miracle was necessary to determine
                           St. Peter to communicate the gospel to the uncircumcised; and St. Paul, in every place, first addressed himself to the Jew,
                           and then to the Gentile. The apostle here sweetly endeavours, in an indirect manner, to silence the presumption of the Romans,
                           who seemed to raise themselves above the Jews, and believed they had merited the grace of vocation to the faith. (Calmet)</font></p><b>
