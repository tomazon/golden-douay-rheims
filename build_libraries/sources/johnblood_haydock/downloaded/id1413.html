                           By this hyperbole, used in Scripture, we are given to understand that the army was greater than could be easily numbered or
                           conceived. (Worthington) --- Philometor had assisted Alexander, with a treacherous design of seizing the kingdom when it should
                           be weakened. (Haydock) --- He had given him his daughter for the same purpose; and now, when Demetrius asserted his claims,
                           he pretended that he would defend his son-in-law, and was thus admitted into all the towns. At Ptolemais he declared his real
                           design, still pretending that Alexander had laid snares for him. While the latter was raising forces in Cilicia, he took Antioch,
                           where he placed two diadems on his head; slew the cruel Ammonius, who had chiefly irritated the people against his master;
                           gave the wife of Alexander to Demetrius; and, in conjunction with him, went to attack Alexander near the river &#338;noparas.
                           Here he received some mortal wounds; though Alexander was routed, and soon after slain in Arabia. (Livy lii.) (Usher, the

                                    nothing resisted him, sent away all his forces, every man to his own place, except the foreign army, which he had drawn together
                                    from the islands of the nations: so all the troops of his fathers hated him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 Now there was one Tryphon, who had been of Alexander's party before:
                                    who seeing that all the army murmured against Demetrius, went to Emalchuel, the Arabian, who brought up Antiochus, the son
                                    of Alexander:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 And he pressed him much to deliver him to him, that he might be king
                                    in his father's place: and he told him all that Demetrius had done, and how his soldiers hated him. And he remained there
                                    many days.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 And Jonathan sent to king Demetrius, desiring that he would cast out
                                    them that were in the castle in Jerusalem, and those that were in the strong holds: because they fought against Israel.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 And Demetrius sent to Jonathan, saying: I will not only do this for
                                    thee, and for thy people, but I will greatly honour thee, and thy nation, when opportunity shall serve.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 Now, therefore, thou shalt do well if thou send me men to help me:
                                    for all my army is gone from me.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 And Jonathan sent him three thousand valiant men to Antioch: and they
                                    came to the king, and the king was very glad of their coming.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">45 And they that were of the city assembled themselves together, to the
                                    number of a hundred and twenty thousand men, and would have killed the king.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">46 And the king fled into the palace: and they of the city kept the passages
                                    of the city, and began to fight.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">47 And the king called the Jews to his assistance: and they came to him
                                    all at once, and they all dispersed themselves through the city.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">48 And they slew in that day a hundred thousand men, and they set fire
                                    to the city, and got many spoils that day, and delivered the king.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">49 And they that were of the city saw that the Jews had got the city
                                    as they would: and they were discouraged in their mind, and cried to the king, making supplication, and saying:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">50 Grant us peace, and let the Jews cease from assaulting us, and the
                                    city.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">51 And they threw down their arms, and made peace, and the Jews were
                                    glorified in the sight of the king, and in the sight of all that were in his realm, and were renowned throughout the kingdom,
                                    and returned to Jerusalem with many spoils.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">52 So king Demetrius sat in the throne of his kingdom: and the land was
                                    quiet before him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">53 And he falsified all whatsoever he had said, and alienated himself
                                    from Jonathan, and did not reward him according to the benefits he had received from him, but gave him great trouble.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">54 And after this Tryphon returned, and with him Antiochus, the young
                                    boy, who was made king, and put on the diadem.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">55 And there assembled unto him all the bands which Demetrius had sent
                                    away, and they fought against Demetrius, who turned his back and fled.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">56 And Tryphon took the elephants, and made himself master of Antioch.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">57 And young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying: I confirm thee in the
                                    high priesthood, and I appoint thee ruler over the four cities, and to be one of the king's friends.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">58 And he sent him vessels of gold for his service, and he gave him leave
                                    to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and to wear a golden buckle:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">59 And he made his brother, Simon, governor from the borders of Tyre
                                    even to the confines of Egypt.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">60 Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the cities beyond the
                                    river: and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves to him to help him, and he came to Ascalon, and they met him honourably
                                    out of the city.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">61 And he went from thence to Gaza: and they that were in Gaza shut him
                                    out: and he besieged it, and burnt all the suburbs round about, and took the spoils.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">62 And the men of Gaza made supplication to Jonathan, and he gave them
                                    the right hand: and he took their sons for hostages, and sent them to Jerusalem: and he went through the country as far as
                                    Damascus.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">63 And Jonathan heard that the generals of Demetrius were come treacherously
                                    to Cades, which is in Galilee, with a great army, purposing to remove him from the affairs of the kingdom.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">64 And he went against them: but left his brother, Simon, in the country.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">65 And Simon encamped against Bethsura, and assaulted it many days, and
                                    shut them up.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">66 And they desired him to make peace, and he granted it them: and he
                                    cast them out from thence, and took the city, and placed a garrison in it.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">67 And Jonathan, and his army, encamped by the water of Genesar, and
                                    before it was light they were ready in the plain of Asor.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">68 And behold the army of the strangers met him in the plain, and they
                                    laid an ambush for him in the mountains: but he went out against them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">69 And they that lay in ambush arose out of their places, and joined
                                    battle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">70 And all that were on Jonathan's side fled, and none was left of them,
                                    but Mathathias, the son of Absalom, and Judas, the son of Calphi, chief captain of the army.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">71 And Jonathan rent his garments, and cast earth upon his head, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">72 And Jonathan turned again to them to battle, and he put them to flight,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">73 And they of his part that fled saw <i>this</i>, and they turned again

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">74 And there fell of the aliens in that day three thousand men: and Jonathan
