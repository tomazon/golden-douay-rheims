                           Hebrew, "with their swords, (Calmet; Protestants, mattocks) round about;" (Haydock) or, "and in their deserts," the inhabitants
                           being removed. Septuagint, "in their places around." Syriac and Arabic, "in their public places." All the interpreters have

                           But the few Israelites who were left, had placed themselves under his protection; and as he made no ravages, and the Cuthites
                           did not adopt the former superstitious practices of the country, they were not concerned to see the altars destroyed; nor
                           were the kings of Assyria informed of, or interested to stop, these proceedings. (Calmet) --- Josias followed the directions
                           of the priests and prophets; (Menochius) and many believe that the Assyrian monarch had given these territories to him, to
                           hold, as his vassal; (Tirinus) or God restored them to the lawful king, (ver. 9) having promised all those countries to the
                           family of David, for the express purpose of keeping up his own worship among his chosen people, and for exterminating idolatry.

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 Because they have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods,

                                    rent thy garments, and wept before me: I also have heard thee, saith the Lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 For now I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be brought
