                           <i>Rejoiced.</i> Septuagint and Chaldean, "been strengthened." Anna composed this canticle at the nativity of her son; or
                           rather at his presentation in the tabernacle. She foretells the reign and glory of the Messias, and of his church. (St. Augustine,
                           de C.[City of God?] xvii. 4.) --- <i>Horn.</i> The <i>horn</i> in the Scripture signifies strength, power, and glory: so the
                           horn is said to be exalted, when a person receives an increase of strength or glory. (Challoner) --- So Horace (3 Ode, 21.)
                           says,<i> addis cornua pauperi.</i> --- <i>Enlarged.</i> Chaldean, "I have opened my mouth, to speak great things against my
                           enemies." She has Phenenna principally in view, and compares her present glory with her former distress. (Calmet) --- I may
                           boast more on account of Samuel, than my rival can of her numerous offspring. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Holy.</i> This is frequently a title of God, the holy one of Israel, Isaias i. 4., and v. 19. He is essentially holy. ---
                           <i>Strong.</i> Hebrew, "no rock like," &amp;c. The rocks of Palestine were the common fortresses of the nation, having caverns
                           to which the people fled for refuge. Hence God is often called a rock, (Calmet) as none can afford such protection. (Haydock)

                           <i>Old.</i> Hebrew <i>hathak</i> means also, "hard things." (Du Hamel) --- "Let arrogance come out of your mouth," to return
                           no more. Yet most people supply the negation from the former member; "Let <i>not</i> arrogance <i>or </i>hard things." Chaldean,
                           "blasphemy," &amp;c. (Calmet) --- Cease to praise idols, as you have done. (Worthington) --- Use not the malevolent language
                           to which you have been accustomed. --- <i>Knowledge.</i> The secrets of hearts are open to him. --- <i>And to him.</i> Hebrew,
                           "and by him actions are weighed," as in scales; (Haydock) or, "thoughts (and actions) are not established." (Symmachus) The
                           Syriac and Arabic also read the negation, "there are not pretexts before him;" or, "are not actions founded upon him?" Will
                           he not execute what he has wisely designed, in spite of opposition? (Haydock) --- Septuagint, "and God prepares his thought;"
                           (Calmet) (<i><u>epitedeumata autou</u></i>) or, "what is convenient for him." (Haydock) --- They have read <i>lu,</i> "of
                           him," instead of <i>la,</i> "not," as they are authorized to do by the Keri, (or various readings in the margin) and by several
                           Hebrew manuscripts. The Protestants think rightly, and suppose that <i>la,</i> "not," has been omitted, "Let <i>not</i> arrogancy;"
                           because we find it in Chaldean, Septuagint, Syriac and Arabic versions. <i>Lu</i> is substituted for <i>la,</i> ver. 16. When
                           some have been pressed with the argument of variations, called Keri, they have said that they were rather explanations of
                           obscure words in the text: but is there any obscurity in <i>lu,</i> "to him," and <i>la,</i> "not;" or can they explain each
                           other? Leusden answers in the affirmative, ver. 16! (Kennicott)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Many.</i> Hebrew, "seven," which is often used in the same sense. Anna had never more than six children; (Calmet) whereas
                           Phenenna had perhaps ten, chap. i. 8., and iii. 21. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins pretend that she lost one every time that Anna
                           brought forth. But the text says nothing of the kind. It only insinuates at most, that she had no more. This admirably represents
                           the state of the Synagogue, compared to the Christian Church. (St. Augustine, sup.) (Calmet; Worthington) --- The blessed
                           Virgin conveys the same idea in other words, Luke i. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           proper. (Haydock) --- He easily makes the greatest prosperity succeed extreme distress, which is often denoted by death, hell,
                           &amp;c. So Seneca says, <i>Mortis habet vices---Lentis cum trahitur vita gemitibus.</i> The prodigal son is said to have come
                           to life again, when his father received him, contrary to his expectations, Luke xv. 24., and Psalm xxix. 4., &amp;c. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           their care. God compares Jeremias to an iron pillar, Jeremias i. 18., and Apocalypse iii. 12. (Calmet) --- The last sentence

                           and ashamed of themselves, (Calmet) they seek for the most obscure retreat, where they may not behold the glory of those whom
                           they have despised. They will pray that the hills would fall upon them, and hide them from the indignation of the Lamb. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           of Mr. Crowley, a late deserter of the Catholic faith, judging of others by the corruption of his own heart, would hence insinuate

                           to such base temptations. If this be a miracle, we may confidently hope that wonders have not ceased, otherwise among his
                           other malicious remarks, he would surely have adduced some proofs of his assertion, from the records of past ages. But in
                           reality he seems to be little acquainted (though he pretends to have been converted by it, &amp;c., and falsely asserts it
                           is kept from laymen) either with history or with the Bible, having read perhaps little more than what his Catechism set before
                           him; and this he boldly contradicts, as if he supposed that his "Thoughts" would have more weight than the decisions of the
                           Fathers and of the whole Church. If he can find a professor of Maynooth, and another or two Irish priests, disposed to follow
                           his example, (which we need not believe on his assertion) what would this prove? Yet Mr. Slack lays great stress on this man's
                           authority, in his late defence of Wesley. (Letters to R. Campion, Esq. Whitby, 1811.) So ready are the enemies of the Catholic
                           faith to scrape together every idle remark that may tend to defame the mother Church! So eager are infidels to reject the
                           faith, on account of the misconduct of some of its degenerate professors! (Haydock) --- The best of fathers have often very

                           <i>Who shall pray for him.</i> By these words Heli would have his sons understand, that by their wicked abuse of sacred things,

                           with God; which was by sacrifices. The more, because as they were the <i>chief priests,</i> whose business it was to intercede
                           for all others, they had no other to offer sacrifice and make atonement for them. (Challoner) --- We need not, however, consider

                           his advocate? What medicines shall be used, when those, which God has appointed, are trodden under foot? (Haydock) --- By
                           persevering in such wickedness, no redress can be expected: and indeed, the infinite distance between God and man, would place
                           an insuperable obstacle to a reconciliation, if Jesus Christ had not undertaken the cause even of the most desperate sinner.

                           hearts with his efficacious grace, but was determined to destroy them. (Challoner) --- They had filled up the measure of their
                           crimes; and, though God wills not the death of a sinner, they had treasured up to themselves wrath, which he will now display.

                           the threat of their father would be executed. (Schmid) (Calmet) --- Sins directly against God, and which hinder his service,
                           are remitted with greater difficulty, though to all true penitents pardon is promised, Ezechiel xxxiii. God did not take away
                           the free will of Ophni and Phinees, but left them to their own obstinacy, and justly punished them. See St. Augustine, contra

                           the house of Ithamar had possession for a time of the high priesthood. We know not when or by what means by obtained it. The
                           promises of God to them were surely only conditional; and some think that they only meant, that as He had permitted them to
                           acquire this high dignity, so it was an earnest that he would not deprive them of it, unless they proved unworthy. But it
                           is generally supposed that God had expressed his determination of this head. Heli, Achitob, Achias, Achimelech, and Abiathar,
                           (Calmet) were the only pontiffs of the family of Ithamar. The last was obliged to resign to (Haydock) Sadoc, under the reign
                           of Solomon, 3 Kings ii. 27. Some suppose that Heli usurped this dignity, (Capel) when he entered upon the civil administration,

                           of Eleazar forfeited this honour by their crimes or indolence, or because they were not of sufficient age. But this reason
                           would not have excluded them for ever. The Scripture, therefore, insinuates that Heli was appointed by God, and that his descendants
                           would have enjoyed his office, if they had not offended. (Calmet) --- These promises were of a conditional nature both to
                           Phinees and to Heli, and Sadoc, ver. 35. See Numbers xxv., &amp;c. (Haydock) --- God never changes. (Menochius)</font></p><b>
