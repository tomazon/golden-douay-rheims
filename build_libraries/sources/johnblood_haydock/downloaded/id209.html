                           the difficulty of the enterprise, the uncertainty of success, and the ardent desire of the apostle, who sought by every means

                           reveal to you and teach you this truth, that we may all continue in the same rule of doctrine and discipline. We may here
                           take notice with St. Chrysostom that it is not enough to believe, or have the true faith, but that we must strive and labour
                           to the end in the way of perfection; secondly that St. Paul did not look upon himself absolutely certain of his salvation:
