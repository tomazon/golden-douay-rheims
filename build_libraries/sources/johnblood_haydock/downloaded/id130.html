                           of a divine revelation, and was accompanied by Barnabas and Titus, the latter of whom he would not suffer to be circumcised.
                           Such confidence had he in the rectitude of the opinion he defended. From the example of St. Paul and St. Barnabas, apostles,
                           and men full of the Spirit of God, we learn, that as often as any contest arises about faith, recourse should be had to the
                           supreme visible authority established by Jesus Christ, to have all differences adjusted. This is the order of divine Providence

                           captivity. But in this respect, it is certain that the prophecy never had its entire accomplishment. The passage in the text
                           is cited from the Septuagint. The Hebrew is, "I will raise up the house of David...that it may possess all the nations," &amp;c.
                           Now it is true that the nations never were subject to the house of David, or known by the name of the people of God; but by
                           their vocation to the gospel, as St. James explains it. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           strangled and from blood.</I> In these prohibitions, the Church indulged the particular feelings of the Jews, that the bond
                           of union between them and the Gentiles might be more closely united; the latter in these two instances giving way to the prejudices
                           of the former, who in their turn gave up much, by submitting to the abolition of the ceremonial law of Moses. This prohibition
                           was of course only temporary, and to cease with the reasons, which gave rise to it. (Menochius) --- The Jews had such a horror
                           of blood, that they considered those who eat it as defiled, and violators of the law of nature. The Lord had in effect from
                           the beginning forbidden the use of blood to Noe [Noah], (Genesis ix. 4.) which he likewise reported in the strongest terms
                           in Leviticus viii. 26.[vii. 26.?]&nbsp;By this we see the great authority of God's Church, and Councils which may make permanent
                           or temporary decrees, such as are fitting for the state of the times or peoples, without any express Scripture at all, and
                           by this authoritative exaction, things become of strict obligation, which previous to it, were in themselves indifferent.

                           No: it shall subsist for ever in a more perfect state, read in the synagogue, and revered by the Church. (Calmet) --- Others
                           give a different explanation of this verse. Let the Jews, say they, follow Moses, and hear him in their assemblies; we have

                           but to last only for a time, as St. Chrysostom observes. (Witham) --- This is the first general council held in the Church,
                           and the model of all succeeding ones. In it the apostles, in a commanding and authoritative manner, laid down the law, which
                           was to be the guide of the faithful, knowing they had a right to impose any regulations in the Church, and that they could
                           not employ this authority but to good purposes, directed as they were by the unerring spirit of truth, which Christ had promised
                           (Matthew xxviii. 20.) should remain with his Church for ever. Hence it would appear that we have no more ground refusing obedience
                           to the voice of the Church at present, than at her first establishment: and that those who will not hear the Church now, speaking
                           in her Councils, would with as little ceremony have opposed the apostles on this occasion, had they lived at the time. By
                           what spirit of seduction has been introduced, and spread, to such an alarming extent, the opinion, that Christianity (the
                           very leading feature of which is to hear and to obey) authorizes unrestricted liberty? Is then authority an unmeaning word?

                           was a dissension,</I>[2] or dispute, with reasoning, and arguing upon the matter. St. Paul represented to St. Barnabas, that
                           he was not for having John Mark to be their companion, because he had before left them, but St. Barnabas was for having with
                           them his kinsman Mark; and the dispute was such, that upon it St. Paul and Barnabas separated; which gave occasion to the
                           preaching of the gospel in more places. See St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxiii. --- The fault in this contention lay with St. Barnabas;&nbsp;<I><U>o

                           Greeks, moreover, remark, that this severity of Paul was of service in strengthening the too pliant character of Mark, and
                           as such he is saluted by Paul. (Colossians iv. 10.) They separated, as formerly Abraham and Lot, without prejudice to their
                           friendship. (Genesis xiii. 9.) (Mat. Polus, synop. criticorum, fol. 4. p. 1528.)</FONT></P>
