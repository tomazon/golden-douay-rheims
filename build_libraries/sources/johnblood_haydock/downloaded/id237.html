                           how the learned St. Augustine, 1400 years ago, expounds the apostle's meaning: "How should he repay as a just judge, unless
                           he had first given as a merciful Father?" (De grat. et lib. arb. chap. vi.) See Hebrews vi. 10. <I>God is not unjust, that

                           62, and of whom he makes mention in his epistle to the Colossians, (iv. 14.) also in that to Philemon, ver. 24. He was perverted
                           in this last voyage, in 65, and abandoned his master in the time of danger. It is not ascertained whether he entirely renounced
                           his faith, or whether God gave his grace to rise from his fall; or whether the love of the world, with which St. Paul here
                           reproaches him, was only a passing fault, and an effect of pure human infirmity. St. Epiphanius (hæres. 51.) presumes that
                           he renounced the faith, and was engaged in the heresies of Cerintus, Ebion, and others, who held Jesus Christ to be no more
                           than a mere man. Many moderns, Grotius, Menochius, Cornel.[Cornelius a Lapide?], &amp;c. believed that he returned with St.
                           Paul: and Estius himself seems to think that he was the same Demas of which St. Ignatius speaks, writing to the Magnesians,
                           calling him <I>a worthy bishop of God.</I> But this is founded on a false supposition, that this letter was written during
                           his first confinement at Rome, or at least before St. Paul wrote his epistles to the Colossians and to Philemon. (Calmet)

                           consent. Crescens went from Rome into Galatia, or into Gaul, as it is found written in the Greek. Theodoret, Eusebius, St.
                           Epiphanius, &amp;c. say that Galatia, in the Greek, is often put for Gaul, in profane authors. On this account it is said
                           by some, that Crescens preached in Gaul. Adon makes him founder of the Church of Vienne, in <SPAN lang=EN>Dauphinè</SPAN>;
                           an opinion still prevalent in that city. The feast of St. Crescens is kept by the Latin Church, on the 27th of June. (Calmet)
                           --- As to Titus, it cannot be doubted but he went into Dalmatia for the purpose of the ministry, and by the order of St. Paul.
                           Thence it seems most probable that he went into Crete, where he governed the Church as bishop, and there died. (Theodoret;

                           St. Luke was always much attached to St. Paul. It is thought he accompanied him to the time of his martyrdom. When St. Paul
                           says Luke <I>alone</I> was with him, we must understand that no other disciple was at that time with him; not that the faithful
                           of Rome, whose faith was so lively and charity so ardent, had abandoned him in this time of danger. (St. Chrysostom, hom.

                           Theodoret and some others have inferred from this verse, that Timothy was not at Ephesus at this time; otherwise St. Paul
                           would have here said, <I>I have sent Tychicus to thee.</I> Timothy, in quality of bishop of Ephesus, had the inspection of
                           the whole province of Asia; hence St. Paul might have presumed, that Tychicus would not be able to find him in that city.
                           But these reasons do not appear sufficiently convincing. Tychicus might have been the bearer of this epistle; then St. Paul
                           might say, I have sent him to carry it. Or St. Paul might have sent him before, and here tells Timothy of it; because, on
                           account of the distance of Rome from Ephesus, he might not have yet heard of his arrival. Mention has been made of Tychicus
                           before, Acts. xx. 4.; Ephesians vi. 71.; Colossians iv. 70. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           (St. Chrysostom, hom. x. p. 611.) --- But the Lord assisted and fortified me on this occasion by a vision, in which he assured
                           me that he would prolong my life for the more perfect preaching of the gospel. (Bible de Vence) --- The times predicted by
                           the apostle in this epistle, (ver. 3. and 4.) are now arrived; and the warnings he gives to Timothy and to all preachers of
                           the word, should be sedulously attended to: <I>preach the word: be instant in season and out of season; reprove, entreat,
                           rebuke with all patience and doctrine.</I> There will arrive a time when men will not bear sound doctrine; eager in the extreme
                           to hear what flatters, they will have recourse to a variety of teachers not lawfully sent or ordained, calculated to <I>tickle
                           their ears</I>: Assentatores populi, multitudinis levitatem voluptate quasi titillantes. (Cicero) In the same sense Plutarch
                           says:&nbsp;<I><U>ta ota apoknaiousin</U>.</I> It is yours, adds St. Paul,&nbsp;<I><U>os kalos stratiotes Christou Iesou</U>,</I>
                           [2 Timothy ii. 3.] as a valiant soldier of Jesus Christ, to oppose yourself as a wall to all these evils, to attend to&nbsp;every
                           branch of your ministerial duty, not to yield to either opponents or dangers, and to see that the gospel is both preached
                           and practised in all its purity. Thus may the Church find in you, and in her other ministers, what she is soon to lose in
                           me, knowing as I do that my course is nearly run. --- <I>That by me the preaching may be accomplished,</I> (or fulfilled)
                           <I>and that all the Gentiles may hear it.</I> This is an argument that he wrote this letter in his first imprisonment. ---
