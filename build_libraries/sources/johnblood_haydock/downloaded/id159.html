                           Gentiles, which he confirms by divers evident testimonies of the holy Scriptures. (Witham) --- He calls our Saviour the minister
                           of circumcision, that is, of the Jews, because he appeared amongst them, dwelt amongst them, and himself preached amongst
                           them. This was a privilege which the Gentiles did no enjoy, having never seen, nor heard Jesus Christ, since he confined his
                           preaching to the strayed sheep of the house of Israel; and this, to accomplish the promises made to their fathers. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Paul does not mean to say, that he never preached where the gospel had before been announced; this would not have been true,
                           for he preached at Damascus, where there were already Christians, whom he formerly wished to take in chains to Jerusalem;
                           and again in this epistle he announces the truths of the gospel to the Romans already converted by the preaching of St. Peter.
                           But he means to say, that on these occasions he acts not as an apostle, whose office it is to preach to infidels; but as one
                           that waters, confirms, comforts, as he says in the beginning of this epistle: and this he did as occasion offered, as the
                           subsequent verses shew, where he tells us his design in calling on the Romans, in his journey to Spain. (Estius)</FONT></P><B>

                           is a matter of dispute, whether St. Paul ever executed this his design of visiting Spain. The proofs of the Spaniards, who
                           consider it as certain, are by no means unanswerable. There remain no certain monuments of this journey of his. The proof
                           taken from the words of St. Clement, who lived at Rome in the time of St. Paul, is not certain, since he only says, that St.
                           Paul came to the very extremities of the west. It is a subject on which commentators appear pretty equally divided. (Calmet)
                           --- There is an old tradition that St. Paul, in his journey to Spain, left three of his disciples in Gaul; Trophimus at Arles,
                           Crescentius at Vienne, and Paul at Narbonne; but this very tradition is disputed. (Bible de Vence)</FONT></P><B>

                           was about to set forward for Jerusalem, with the charities collected in Achaia and Macedonia, for the poor Christians in Judea.
                           This he calls to <I>minister</I> to the poor saints, or to be <I>serviceable</I> to them. And to exhort others to the like
                           charitable contributions, he says, (ver. 27.) <I>they are their debtors;</I> that the converted Gentiles are debtors to the
                           converts, who had been Jews, as having been made partakers of the promises, particularly made to the people of the Jews, and
                           sharers of those spiritual blessings, which Christ promised to the Jews, but were also conferred upon the Gentiles. He looks
                           upon it, therefore, reasonable, that they relieve the Jews in their temporal wants. The apostle says, he goes <I>to consign
                           to them this fruit,</I> to deliver to them their contributions. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>
