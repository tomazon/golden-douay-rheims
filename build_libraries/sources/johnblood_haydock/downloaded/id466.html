                           Hebrew, "ceremony." Septuagint, "distinction, (<I>diastole,</I> St. Augustine, q. 33,) or ordinance." (Calmet) --- <I>Victim.</I>
                           Hebrew, "the ordinance of the law." (Du Hamel) --- <I>A red cow,</I> &amp;c. This red cow, offered in sacrifice for sin, and
                           consumed with fire without the camp, with the ashes of which, mingled with water, the unclean were to be expiated and purified;
                           was a figure of the passion of Christ, by whose precious blood, applied to our souls in the holy sacraments, we are cleansed
                           from our sins. (Challoner) --- <I>Age,</I> three years old. Some translate, "entirely red." They suppose, that these regulations
                           are in opposition to the customs of the Egyptians, who never sacrificed the cow, esteeming it sacred to Isis, or to the moon.
                           Spencer (Rit. ii. 15) adds, that the <I>red</I> colour was formerly in the highest estimation; and this victim represented
                           the death of Christ, who expiated our defilements. The Egyptians immolated bulls of a red colour, in hatred of Typhon, and
                           to appease that dangerous god, whom they depicted perfectly red. Plut.[Plutarch?] (Isis) observes, that they hate all animals
                           of that colour; and the Copths precipitate a red ass down a precipice. The ancient kings of Egypt sacrificed red men on the
                           tomb of Osiris or Dyphon; (Diod. Bib. 1,) and Manetho assures us, that they scattered their ashes in the wind. If this custom
                           prevailed in the days of Moses, we need not wonder that he teaches the Hebrews to have so little dread of Typhon, as even
                           to chose a red cow in preference, to purify themselves. --- <I>Yoke.</I> Such victims were generally chosen by the Romans,
                           Greeks, and Egyptians, as more delicate and respectful. <I>Intacta totidem cervice juvencus.</I> (Georg. iv.; Bochart, anim.
                           2. 33.) St. Jerome (ep. 27,) says, that a red cow was sacrificed every year, as in reality one would be requisite for all
                           the people, though the Rabbins pretend that only seven, or ten at most, were treated in this manner, from Moses till the destruction
                           of the temple by Titus. (Drusius)</FONT></P><B>

                           to some other priests, who accompanied Eleazar on this occasion, ver. 8. (Calmet) --- Aaron did not perform this office, as
                           the sacrifice was not solemn, but sorrowful, and designed for purification. (Menochius) --- The Rabbins say, however, that
                           the high priest performed this ceremony ever after; and, since the building of the temple, they did it upon Mount Olivet.
                           This is also remarked by St. Jerome, ep. 27. It was thus a more lively figure of Jesus Christ sweating blood on that same
                           ground; as the smoke might represent his ascension, Acts i. 10., and Luke xxii. 44. (Calmet) --- He died out of Jerusalem,
                           in full age, (ver. 2,) or 33 years old, being wounded in every part for our transgressions, (ver. 5,) setting us an example
                           how to suffer, (ver. 6,) and by his blood communicating virtue to the sacraments, ver. 5. His body, derived from Adam, (or
                           <I>red earth,</I> ver. 2,) was buried in a most clean place, (ver. 9,) and those who crucified him became more unclean; (ver.
                           8,) while even those who were employed in burying him, (ver. 9,) required to be cleansed by the grace of his passion, which
                           must be communicated to them by baptism, in the name of the blessed Trinity, without which they cannot partake of any of the
                           sacraments, chap. xii. The old law could bring nothing to perfection. Those who lived under that dispensation, were forced
                           to wait till the evening, (ver. 7,) when in the last ages the new law commenced, that by faith in Christ, they might obtain
                           the remission of their sins. Thus we perceive the meaning of many things which to the Jews were veiled in shadows, Hebrews
                           x. (St. Augustine, q. 33.; Theodoret, q. 36.) (Worthington) --- The Fathers observe also, that the infirmity of our Saviour's
                           flesh, and his liberty in giving and resuming his life, (John x. 18,) were denoted by the cow, which had never been yoked.

                           Hebrew, "And Eleazar, the priest, shall take part of her blood with his finger." He looked from the pile of wood, where he
                           was standing, towards the west, and sprinkled the blood, and wiping his fingers upon the skin of the cow, waiting till the
                           fire was kindled, before he opened her belly; he then threw into the fire the cedar-wood, &amp;c. (Drusius) --- Others believe
                           that this last ceremony was performed by some one else, (ver. 7,) as it is not clear that Eleazar became unclean. His being
                           substituted instead of Aaron, might shew that Christ would institute a new priesthood.</FONT></P><B>

                           If he neglect to be sprinkled on the third day, his purification will be protracted till the 10th. As this was the only means

                           water. The pagans generally preferred the water of the sea; or if they could not procure any, they mixed salt with common
                           water. Ovid (Fast iv,) mentions a lustration made with the ashes of a calf, mixed with horse blood; and another, which was
                           used in honour of Pales, the goddess of harvests, by the oldest virgin present, who sprinkled the ashes of calves, <I>populos

                           for the purification of the unclean; and the ancient Romans, who had been at a funeral, sprinkled themselves with water, and
                           jumped over fire for the same purpose; as the Greeks were accustomed to place a vessel full of water, at the doors where a
