                           language, which has induced a belief that it is not a translation. (Calmet) --- But that is no very strong argument. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           laws; (Cyrop. i.; Brisson ii. p. 250.) and the Persian kings were particularly careful to reward those who had done them good.

                           lead astray the unsuspecting benevolence of governors." (Haydock) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] xi. 3.) gives nearly the same
                           sense: (Calmet) "For some of these, being placed in power by their friends, and bearing a private hatred towards some, have
                           deluded their princes by false reasons, and by accusations have persuaded them to stir up the wrath of those who have done
