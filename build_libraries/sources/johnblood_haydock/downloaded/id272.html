                           This seems to be the liberal sense of this fourth verse, which is obscure, and has divers reading in the Greek. In the examples
                           of the deluge and of Sodom, St. Peter shews not only the severity of God's judgments upon the wicked, but also his merciful
                           providence towards the small number of the just, as towards Noe[Noah], a preacher of justice, the eighth and chief of those
                           who were preserved in the ark, when he spared not the world that was of old, (literally, the original world) or wicked of
                           those ancient times. When he delivered that just man, Lot, at the time he reduced Sodom and those other cities to ashes: for
                           Lot was just both in sight and hearing, without being corrupted by what he saw and heard; chaste as to his eyes and ears,
                           or as to all that could be seen or heard of him, when the wicked among whom he lived vexed and grieved his just soul by their
                           impious deeds. God, therefore, who knows and approves the ways of the godly, preserves them by his providence amidst temptations.
