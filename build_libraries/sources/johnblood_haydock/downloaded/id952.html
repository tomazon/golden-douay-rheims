                           <i>Now.</i> This list is entirely of a political nature. It seems to have been made before David had obtained the throne of
                           Israel, (ver. 7.) though perhaps the monthly division did not comprise 24,000, before that time. This regulation was very
                           excellent, and enabled the king to have an army of 300,000 men, at a short notice. It was not attended with any material inconvenience
                           to the people, as none were on service above a month. --- <i>Hands.</i> Commanders in chief. --- <i>Captains.</i> Twenty-four
                           in number, with 240 centurions under them. --- <i>Officers.</i> Hebrew <i>shoterim.</i> Septuagint, "scribes," whose employment
                           is not well ascertained. They perhaps acted as commissaries, or kept an account of the king's troops, and reviewed them. (Calmet)
                           --- Septuagint, "and scribes serving the people, and the king's orders respecting the divisions, both coming in and going
                           out, monthly, throughout the year. One division comprised 24,000 men.</font></p><b>
