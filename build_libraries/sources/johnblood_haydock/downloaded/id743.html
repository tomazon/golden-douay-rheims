                           <i>David.</i> It is not known when this was composed. David praises the works and law of God. Some passages are applied to
                           Jesus Christ and his apostles, Romans x. 18. (Calmet) --- When any text of a psalm is thus quoted, many judiciously conclude
                           that the whole must be understood in the same sense, as the harmony will thus be greater. It seems there are two literal senses
                           here, one regarding the law, whether natural or Mosaic; the other pertaining to the apostles and the law of the gospel; (Berthier)
                           the "beloved" <i>David</i> of the latter days. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Firmament.</i> Hebrew, "expansion," or region of the stars, far above our atmosphere. (Berthier) --- These two sentences
                           express the same idea, unless the former may denote what we behold, and the firmament be explained of the higher heavens,
                           (Haydock) where we imagine the throne of God to be placed. Some have taken these expressions in a gross sense, and asserted
                           that the heavens are animated, Job xxxviii. 7. But we must allow that they are figurative expressions, which seem to give
                           a soul to plants, stars, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- The beautiful works of God extort our admiration. (Haydock) --- The silence
                           of heaven speaks louder than any trumpet. (St. Chrysostom) --- "Who can behold the heavens, and yet be so foolish as not to
                           acknowledge that a God exists? said Cicero, (Haydock) a learned pagan; (Arusp. and Nat. Deo. 2.; Calmet) though they cannot
                           determine of what nature the Deity may be. (Leg. i.; Menochius) --- <i>Hands.</i> Chaldean, "Those who look up at the heavens,
                           publish the glory of the Lord; and those who raise their eyes towards the air, announce his works." (Calmet) --- The silent
                           works declare God's Majesty to those who consider them, and his preachers make the same known to their hearers by word of
                           mouth. (Worthington) --- St. Paul reproaches the philosophers of paganism for not understanding the language of the creation,
                           Romans i. 20., and Job xii. 7. (Haydock) --- The Church, which is so often styled the kingdom of <i>heaven,</i> makes God
                           known, not only as a Creator, but also as a Redeemer. The figure is here most beautifully preserved. Heaven denotes the Church,
                           as the stars represent apostolic men, who cease not to perform their duties day or night, in happier days as well as under
                           persecution. Jesus Christ is the true sun of justice, enlightening every man that cometh into the world, (St. John i.) ---
                           The Fathers have made these remarks. (Berthier) --- What a consolation must it be for Catholics to think that the true doctrine
                           will never cease, no more than the succession of day and night! We have received our creed, our orders and mission, from the
                           apostles. The chain of succession has never been broken. Unhappy those who make a religion of their own to damn souls! who
                           <i>run,</i> though God <i>send</i> them <i>not!</i> (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Utterth,</i> with great force and abundance, <i>eructat.</i> --- <i>Knowledge</i> of God. (Berthier) --- Our knowledge
                           is always on the increase. (Abenezra) --- The vicissitudes of day and night prove the wisdom of their author. (Eusebius) ---
                           They seem to sing in succession the praises of God. (Bellarmine) --- This evinces the power of God, as the perpetual propagation
                           of the gospel does that of Jesus Christ, whose Church will last till the end. (Worthington) --- All the chief reformers acknowledged
                           that there was no salvation out of the one true Church, and that the Church of Rome is such. (Nightingale, p. 263.) (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>There.</i> Symmachus joins this with the preceding. "Will announce knowledge. Not by words or speeches, the sounds of which
                           are not heard," so as to be understood. (Haydock) --- "They are not languages or words, the signification of which is unknown;"
                           or Hebrew, "never has their voice been heard." <i>Beli,</i> "not," may also signify <i>absque,</i> "without;" and thus we
                           may render, "no speeches, (or country) where their voice has not been heard." (Berthier) --- The sight of the heavens is sufficient
                           to convince any one of the existence of God. (Haydock) --- No nation, however barbarous, can plead ignorance. The Fathers
                           have explained this of the gift of tongues, by means of which the apostles spoke languages which they had not studied, Acts
                           ii. 4. (St. Augustine, &amp;c.) --- Some of every nation have heard, (Worthington) or will embrace, (Haydock) the Christian
                           religion. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Sound.</i> So, St. Paul reads this text, though the Hebrew have, "line." Yet there is no reason why we should suppose that
                           the Septuagint read differently, or that the Jews have corrupted their copies, as they could derive no advantage from so doing
                           (Berthier) here, unless it were to discredit the apostle; as infidels assert the truth of the Old Testament, to vilify the
                           new. <i>Kum</i> (Haydock) may signify a "line," (Berthier) or "writing." (Abenezra) --- The greatest exactitude has been observed
                           in forming the world, as if all had been measured by an architect. But the sense of the Vulgate is preferable, and is adopted
                           by Symmachus, St. Jerome, and the Syriac. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "their line." Marginal note, "their rule <i>or</i> direction."
                           <i>Kolam,</i> "their voice," occurs in the preceding verse. The <i>l</i> might easily be lost, (Haydock) or omitted by a poetical
                           licence. (Genebrard.) (Menochius) --- <i>Their,</i> refers to the heavens representing the apostles, as St. Paul explains
                           this text, to prove that all were inexcusable who would not believe the gospel. (Berthier)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Sun.</i> Here God seems to reside, (Ferrand) and the magnificence of his works shines forth, insomuch that almost all nations
                           have offered divine honours to the sun, and even the Manichees adored it, imagining that it was the very body of Jesus Christ.
                           (St. Augustine, contra Faust. xiv. 12., and xx. 6.) --- Hebrew, "For the sun he has place a tent in them," the heavens, (St.
                           Jerome; Haydock) or the ends of the world. The Jews supposed that the heavens rested, like a tent, upon the earth. (Calmet,
                           Diss.) --- The Hebrew preposition <i>l,</i> may have (Haydock) different meanings, <i>ad solem posuit,</i> &amp;c. "He placed
                           a tent in them, at <i>or </i>for the sun." The idea of the Vulgate is more noble, but we would not exclude the other, which
                           is very good, (Berthier) and obviates the gross mistake of the Manichees. (Amama) --- The Vulgate may admit the fig. hypallage,
                           (M. Geneb.) as good authors say <i>dare classibus austros,</i> and thus it may signify "he placed the sun in his tent." (Haydock)
                           --- This vast body stands in need of no vehicle, or tent, but itself. (Diodorus) --- It was placed in the firmament at first,
                           (Genesis i. 16.) and still performs its revolutions exactly. (Haydock) --- <i>Giant.</i> Moderns would render "a strong man;"
                           and Bythner remarks that the bulk of a giant would render him less fit for running, as if the stoutest wrestlers were not
                           often the most active. (Berthier) --- The sun is represented as a hero at some of the ancient games. St. Augustine and St.
                           Jerome explain all this of Jesus Christ, who diffuses the light and warmth of his grace throughout the world. (Calmet) ---
                           He always resides with the Church, and is never divorced from her. (Worthington) </font></p><b>

                           <i>Circuit.</i> So the Hebrew word is rendered "revolution." Septuagint and Vulgate, "meeting" <i>occursus,</i> may insinuate
                           that the sun is found in the centre, while the earth moves daily and yearly round it, according to the Copernican system.
                           But we must be more attentive to the life and motions of Jesus Christ, in whom the Deity resided corporally. (Berthier)</font></p><b>

                           <i>The law.</i> As the sun gives light to the world, so the law serves to direct mankind, and is another most powerful motive
                           for us to praise God. This raises our hearts and minds still more perfectly to him, recalling us from our wanderings, and
                           confirming our knowledge. Light is necessary for the body, and the law for the soul. The prophet admires eight characteristics
                           of this divine law, which he designates by different names; as in the 118th psalm, some things relate only to the evangelical
                           law, which converts souls, (Berthier) and lasts for ever, ver. 10. (Haydock) --- The law of nature and of Moses are nevertheless
                           also commended, (Theodoret) inasmuch as the morality is always the same; and some faith in Christ, to come, or already past,
                           is requisite under every dispensation. Hence he is called the <i>Lamb slain from the beginning.</i> [Apocalypse xiii. 8.]
                           Implicit faith would suffice for the less informed, before our Saviour's coming; but now, under the light of the gospel, we
                           must express our belief in his incarnation, as well as in the blessed Trinity. More is required of those to whom more has
                           been given. [Luke xii. 48.] (Haydock) --- <i>Unspotted.</i> Hebrew and Septuagint, "irreprehensible." (Calmet) --- Who indeed
                           could pretend to find any fault with it, since it comes from God? (Haydock) --- The laws of men are imperfect, and liable
                           to change. Those of Draco were too sanguinary, and gave place to Solon's, which were deemed too mild, &amp;c. How happy would
                           all be if they would embrace the law of the gospel! (Berthier) --- <i>Converting.</i> Hebrew, "tranquillizing souls," (Menochius)
                           by keeping the passions under. (Haydock) --- <i>Testimony,</i> declaring the will of God to men. --- <i>Little ones.</i> The
                           simple, and the wicked; as both are so called. (Calmet) --- <i>Pethi,</i> "easily persuaded." (Menochius) --- It directs the
                           former, and keeps the latter in awe by punishment. (Calmet) --- All, in general, must confess their ignorance, and <i>want</i>
                           of the divine law, to reap any benefit from it. (Haydock) --- This is the first lesson which it imparts. (Berthier) --- The
                           law is most pure in itself, whether we understand that given to Moses, or the gospel. But the latter makes the observers unspotted,
                           by the grace which the Holy Ghost communicates to them, though all who barely read and know the law, have no share in this
                           happiness. God is the author of salvation, sweetly inviting all by the perfections of his law, which confers light and gladness,
                           to co-operate with grace, that they may obtain the promised reward, ver. 12., and 2 Timothy iv. 6. (Worthington) --- The like
                           grace was offered from the beginning, so that none will ever be punished who has not deserved it, having had the means to
                           perform his duty. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           acknowledge that the morality of the Gospel is excellent, but they reject the dogmatical part. Would He, who has prescribed
                           such noble rules of conduct, lead our understanding astray, by requiring us to believe what is false? (Berthier)</font></p><b>

                           it as essential, before a person can obtain salvation. But where does God specify this condition? We know that (Haydock) we
                           are to work out our salvation in fear and trembling; and that St. Paul, though conscious to himself of nothing, said: yet
                           <i>in this I am not justified,</i> &amp;c., 1 Corinthians iv. 4., and ix. 27., and Philippians ii. 12. Hebrew speaks of "ignorances,"
                           which might not however be wholly blameless. (Berthier) --- <i>Ones,</i> or enemies: "....and from the proud preserve." (Symmachus;
                           Chaldean) But he alludes to the distinction of sins of ignorance and of pride, (Leviticus iv. 2., and Numbers xv. 30.; Calmet)
                           or malice. (Haydock) --- David had not fallen into many sins of the latter description, though his adultery and murder were
                           such. But the former are daily sins, into which even the just fall frequently. (Calmet) --- None can be assured of their state,

                           --- Hebrew, "the proud." It is conjectured (Berthier) that the Septuagint read <i>r</i> for <i>d,</i> in <i>mizzedim.</i>
                           (Haydock) (Amama) --- But this is not necessary, as they might include the proud, and all the wicked, under the name of "strangers,"
                           which term is particularly applicable to idolaters, (Isaias xiii. 11.) and all scandalous sinners, who are strangers to the
                           law; and from whose society and dominion we may all beg to be delivered. (Berthier) --- <i>Spare.</i> Hebrew, "free," (St.
                           Jerome) or "withhold." Nature is so prone to evil, that the prophet prays earnestly for grace to resist, or to be kept out
                           of danger. (Haydock) --- All sins cannot be avoided, but preserve me from wilfully committing any enormous crime. (Rivet)
                           --- Deliver me from the devil's power. (Theodoret) --- Those who are in authority have much to dread, lest they be answerable
                           for the sins of others, which they ought to have prevented; as all must fear giving scandal, &amp;c., and so being accessory
                           to another's crime. [1 Timothy v. 22.] (Haydock) --- <i>Delicta aliena affigunt me.</i> (St. Augustine) --- Yet sins of frailty,
                           and of malice, are here meant; (Bellarmine) which last ought to be strange, or very uncommon. --- <i>Over me.</i> Septuagint,
                           <i><u>mou</u>.</i> (Haydock) --- St. Augustine reads <i>dominata,</i> which agrees better with <i>delicta.</i> If my secret
                           sins, or those of others, do not oppress me, I shall pray with confidence, and be heard. (Calmet) --- Yet <i>dominata</i>
                           refers to <i>alienis,</i> strangers, or proud people, (Berthier) who are continually alluring to evil, both by word and example.
                           How great must be the influence of such over their subjects, when even their equals take the infection so frequently! Vulgate
                           might be rendered, "If my own had not ruled;" in which sense Pius IV used this explanation on his death bed, knowing that
                           his kindred had abused their power. (Du Thou, B. vi. A.D. 1549.) (Haydock) --- <i>Sin,</i> pride; the source of all evil.
                           (St. Jerome) --- "Let men at last blush to be proud, for whose sake God was humbled." (St. Augustine) --- If mortal sin be
                           absent, the soul is just, and will be, one day, free from stain. (Worthington)</font></p><b>
