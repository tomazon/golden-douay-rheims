                           seems the best, (Calmet) and is followed by the Protestant version. (Haydock) --- <I>Sicles,</I> including all his hair. The
                           Hebrews wore their hair very long. It does not commonly grow above four inches in a year; so that the hair which was cut off
                           could not weigh 200 sicles. (Calmet) --- <I>Weight.</I> Hebrew, "after the king's stone," <I>Beeben;</I> but one manuscript
                           has <I>Boshkol,</I> with the Septuagint, "after the king's sicle (Kennicott) weight," at Babylon, as Pelletier supposes that
                           this work was written towards the end of the captivity. He allows that Absalom's hair might weigh almost 31 ounces. Some women
                           wear above 32 ounces, if we may believe the hair-dressers. Some suppose that <I>r</I> (200) has been substituted instead of
                           <I>d</I> (4) or <I>c,</I> (20) &amp;c. But all are not convinced that the Hebrews formerly marked the numbers by letters.
                           Septuagint have, "100 sicles," (Calmet) which some attempt to reconcile with the common reading, by saying, that they speak
                           of the sicles of the sanctuary, which were double the weight of the king's sicle. Yet the Alexandrian and Vatican copies agree
                           with the Vulgate: (Haydock) and of this distinction of weights there is no proof. The Rabbins assert that the value, and not
                           the weight, of Absalom's hair is given; (Calmet) and that he made a present of his hair to some of his friends, who sold it
                           to the ladies of Jerusalem, to adorn their heads. (Sanctius) --- Tirinus adopts this sentiment, and ridicules those who say
                           that the weight is meant; as he says, 200 sicles would be equivalent to 8¾ Roman pounds, which comes near to Arbuthnot's calculation
                           in English. (Haydock) --- Bochart reduces the weight to four such pounds, each consisting of twelve ounces; and he supposes
                           that the hair was so heavy, on account of the gold dust with which it was covered, according to the fashion of those times.
                           (Josephus, [Antiquities?] viii. 1.) --- But this weight would be only accidental. (Calmet) --- Josephus ([Antiquities?] vii.
                           8.) intimates, that Absalom's hair was "cut every eight days," or "for the space of eight days." It is quite incredible that
                           it should weigh 200 sicles, or five minæ of Alexandria, each consisting of twelve ounces. The Latin interpreter reads, "every
                           eight months." (Calmet) --- St. Epiphanius and Hero have 125 sicles, or about 31 ounces. (Haydock) --- The Babylonian sicle,
                           here mentioned, was only the third part of that used by the Hebrews. (Du Hamel)</FONT></P><B>

                           received the name from her aunt, who resided with Absalom. (Menochius) --- Some Greek and Latin copies add, that she was married
                           to Roboam, the son of Solomon, by whom he had Abias. But this addition is of no authority, and can hardly be reconciled with
                           chronology. We read that Roboam espoused Maaca, the daughter of Absalom; (2 Paralipomenon xi. 20.) but she might be only his
                           grand-daughter, by Thamar. (Calmet) --- Josephus had adopted this addition. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And the king hath hearkened to me, to deliver his handmaid out of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Then let thy handmaid say, that the word of my lord the king be made

                                    all these things, which my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he commanded me, and he put all these words into

                                    thou hast fulfilled the request of thy servant.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Then Joab arose and went to Gessur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</font></p>

                                    see my face. So Absalom returned into his house, and saw not the king's face.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 But in all Israel there was not a man so comely, and so exceedingly

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And when he polled his hair (now he was polled once a year, because

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And there were born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter, whose

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 He said to his servants: You know the field of Joab, near my field,

                                    coming, with their garments rent, said: The servants of Absalom have set part of the field on fire.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and said: Why have

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 And Absalom answered Joab: I sent to thee, beseeching thee to come
                                    to me, that I might send thee to the king, to say to him: Wherefore am I come from Gessur? It had been better for me to be
                                    there. I beseech thee, therefore, that I may see the face of the king: and if he be mindful of my iniquity, let him kill me.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 So Joab going in to the king, told him all: and Absalom was called
