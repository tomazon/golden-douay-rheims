                           <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">This psalm has no title, and therefore, St. Jerome, after the Jews, consider
                           it as a part of the former. In Acts xiii. 33., some copies have, in <i>the first,</i> others in <i>the second psalm;</i> and
                           Origen testifies that he saw a copy where this and the former psalm were joined together; and he says, the psalms were not
                           distinguished by numbers or letters, as they have been since. We find in some Greek and Latin manuscripts, "a psalm of David."
                           It is certain that he composed it, speaking of the Messias, (Acts iv. 25., and Hebrews i. 5.) though some passages may be
                           applied to himself. The Rabbins would restrain it to him entirely; and some Christians have been so much off their guard,
                           as to allow (Calmet) that it refers to David in the literal sense, and to Christ only in the spiritual; (Lyranus; Grotius)
                           which would destroy the force of the prophecy. David takes occasion, (Calmet) from the opposition which was made by Saul,
                           (Haydock) the Philistines, &amp;c., (2 Kings v. 7; Josephus, [Jewish Antiquities?] vii. 4.) to his own exaltation, to foretell
                           the similar rage with which many would resist the Messias. (Calmet) --- The Philistines, however, had no <i>kings</i> to oppose
                           David, as Kimchi confesses; and we had better refer the whole psalm to Christ. (Berthier)</font></p><b>

                           not agree. (Calmet) --- The priests had, in vain, meditated on the law, since they had not discovered Him who was the end

                           as the attempt of the surrounding nations to dethrone David was, in contradiction to the divine appointment. He is sometimes
                           styled the Christ, or "anointed of the Lord," Psalm xix. 7. But the Chaldean has, "to revolt from the Lord, and fight with
                           his Messias." So that the ancient Jews agreed with us, (Calmet) and it would be "rash to abandon the interpretation given
                           by St. Peter." (St. Jerome)</font></p><b>

                           Christ, encourage one another (Calmet) to subvert their authority, before it be too well established. Protestants still seem
                           to be actuated with the same phrensy; fearing nothing more than the restoration of the Catholic religion [in Great Britain];
                           and incessantly pouring in petitions to [the British] Parliament to withhold the common rights of subjects from people of
                           that [Catholic] persuasion. (Haydock) --- "I fear there are more <i>political</i> than <i>religious</i> objectors to emancipation

                           bent on persecuting the faithful. If they still resist, (Haydock) he will shew the futility of their plans, and triumph over
                           all, as David did over his opponents, and Christ over those who wished to have obstructed his resurrection, and the propagation
                           of his gospel. Thus Jesus has proved his divinity, and confirmed our hopes that he will still protect his Church; as he did
                           when it seemed to be in the greatest danger. (Calmet) --- God can fear no opposition to his decrees. (Menochius) --- He is
                           in <i>Heaven,</i> to whom we ought to address our prayers. The <i>Lord</i> seems to be here applicable to Christ. Chaldean,

                           confounded the devil, when Christ descended to take away his spoils; and he chastised the Jews by the ruin of their city,
                           (Calmet) as he has or will do all persecutors of his Church. (Haydock) --- He will severely reprehend, and justly punish the

                           <i>I am.</i> Hebrew, "I have anointed....over Sion, my," &amp;c. St. Jerome and others have read in the first person, what
                           the Septuagint translate in the third. The sense is much the same. (Calmet) --- But the Vulgate seems to be better connected,
                           and the same letters may have this sense, if we neglect the points, which were unknown to the Septuagint and of modern invention.
                           These interpreters may also have read a <i>v</i> for <i>i,</i> as these letters are very similar. (Berthier) --- "But I am
                           anointed king by him over Sion, his holy mountain." (Houbigant) --- Theodoret, observing that Christ is king not only over
                           Sion, but also over all, alters the punctuation: <i>On Sion....preaching,</i> &amp;c., which is very plausible, since Isaias
                           (ix. 3.) says, <i>the law shall come forth from Sion,</i> (Berthier) and [Isaias] chap. xxxvii. 32., <i>and salvation from
                           Mount Sion.</i> Hence Christ preached frequently in the temple. It is certain David was not anointed here, but at Hebron;
                           and the temple was not built till the reign of Solomon. See Psalm cix. 2.</font></p><b>

                           <i>Thee.</i> Chaldean weakens this text. (Haydock) --- "I love thee as my son, and look upon thee with the same affection,
                           as if I had this day created thee;" which might be applied to David, now settled more firmly on the throne by his late victory.
                           But it literally refers to Christ, either born in time, (ver. 1., St. Augustine; Calmet) or baptized; (St. Justin Martyr)
                           or rather rising again, (Acts xiii. 33.) and born from all eternity, Hebrews i. 5. This shews him superior to the angels.
                           The prophet had both these events in view. Eternity is always the same. (Berthier; Bossuet; Du Hamel) --- He to whom God may
                           speak thus <i>to-day,</i> at all times, must be God also. (Robertson, Lexic.) (John v. 25.) --- To this Socinians can make
                           no reply, without giving up the Epistle to the Hebrews or allowing that the apostle's arguments were inconclusive. (Berthier)
                           --- The same text may thus have many literal senses. (Du Hamel) --- The eternal birth seems here to be the chief, as from
                           that source the nativity, baptism, priesthood, (Hebrews xv. 5.[v. 5.?]) and miraculous resurrection of Christ, necessarily
                           spring. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           dominion? (Berthier) --- But Christ's kingdom extends over the world. His Church cannot fail, as St. Augustine proved hence
                           against the Donatists, and his arguments confute Protestants as well. (Worthington) --- Our doctors used to refer this psalm
                           to the Messias, said R. Solomon; but it is better to apply it to David, on account of "Christians." (Du Hamel)</font></p><b>

                           taken on the rebellious; and we might translate, "Thou shalt break," &amp;c. (Calmet) --- Yet this is not necessary, as a
                           shepherd sometimes beats with severity, to prevent his sheep from straying. (Haydock) --- The Church guides also use coercion,
                           but for the good of the flock. (Calmet) --- God brought the murderers of his Son to an evil end, and destroyed their city.
                           (Haydock) --- He broke the Gentiles, to make them a more noble vessel, Jeremias xviii. 4. (St. Hilary) --- He will execute
                           judgment at the last day, Apocalypse xix. 11. (Calmet) --- When the clay is still soft, the vessel may easily be repaired;
                           so the sinner may be reclaimed, when he has only just fallen. (St. Jerome) --- Even the most obdurate, are as clay in God's
                           hands. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           <i>And.</i> Here the prophet may address kings, unless the Father or the Messias continue to speak. It is evident these words
                           are not to be understood of David's dominions alone. Fear and joy keep the Christian in proper order, Philippians ii. 12.,
                           and iii. 1. (Berthier) --- "The love of God pushes us forward, and the fear of God makes us take care where we walk." (St.
                           Theresa [of Avila?]) --- The one guards us against despair, the other against presumption. Kings are here instructed to support
                           the Church, for which some have been styled, "Most Christian," "Catholic," or "Defenders of the Faith." The Donatists falsely
                           asserted, that they were ever found enemies to religion, because of Constantine, &amp;c., attempted to repress their errors.
                           But Julian favoured them, to increase dissensions. See St. Augustine, contra Pet. et contra Gaud. ii. 26. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Discipline.</i> Chaldean, "doctrine." St. Jerome, "adore purely." Protestants, "kiss the Son, lest he be angry," &amp;c.
                           (Haydock) --- Houbigant, "adore the son, lest he be angry, and you perish. For he comes forward, and shortly his wrath will
                           be enkindled." This version seems to be judicious: that of the Vulgate is less energetic, but comes to the same end, as those
                           who adore the Messias, must follow his doctrine. (Berthier) --- <i>Lord</i> and <i>just</i> is not in [the] Hebrew. (Haydock)
                           --- The <i>way</i> or projects of sinners will perish; (Psalm i. 6.) they will be hurried before the tribunal, as soon as
                           they are dead; (St. Hilary) and when they least expect it, 1 Thessalonians v. 2. (Calmet) --- Some fall from salvation, and
                           God will bring them to judgment at the end of this short life. (Worthington) --- Hebrew, "Kiss purely." Kissing is often used
                           in Scripture to express submission, love, and adoration. (St. Jerome, contra Ruf. i.) (Genesis xli. 40.) (Calmet) --- We testify
                           our respect for God, by kissing the Bible, &amp;c. (Haydock) --- But it cannot be shewn that <i>bar</i> means "a son," in
                           Hebrew. (Calmet) --- Amama blames the Vulgate for withdrawing a text in favour of Christ's divinity. We must, however, submit
                           to the law and faith of Christ with confidence and love, if we desire to escape his indignation and enter heaven, Acts iv.
                           12. Mr. Nightingale (Portrait of Cath. 1812. p. 117 and 332) may represent this doctrine as uncharitable and groundless, though
                           he allows it has been maintained by most (p. 473) who have professed to be the true disciples of Christ, whether Catholics
                           or Protestants. The principle is good, though some apply it wrong. If he and Lord Milton, (speech. 1812. to whom we must express
                           our manifest obligations) had contented themselves with saying that they believed our doctrine was "unscriptural," &amp;c.,
                           (p. 18) we should not have much wondered; as they could not consistently have said less, and remained out of the Catholic
                           Church. But for any man who has read the Bible, to persuade himself that it is not necessary to profess the one only true
                           religion, wherever it may be, after Christ has so plainly declared, <i>He that believeth not is already judged,</i> and <i>shall
                           be condemned;</i> (John iii. 18., and Mark xvi. 16.) and after the apostle has delivered over to satan those who only asserted
                           that the <i>resurrection was past,</i> (2 Timothy ii. 17.) this fills us with astonishment. Not a single text can be produced
                           in favour of the contrary system leading to indifference about religion; which, if true, would shew the preaching of the prophets
                           and apostles as nugatory, and their blood shed in vain. All the "Scriptures" proclaim the necessity of faith and good works.
                           We may observe, that the doctrine of the blessed Trinity seems to be no less objectionable to Mr. N. than the rest of our
                           faith, p. 117, &amp;c. Yet (Haydock) we must not refuse him the praise of liberality. (Catholic Review, &amp;c., Jan. 1813.)
