                           high priest.</I> He speaks first of the office of priests in general, before he speaks of Christ's priesthood. A priest is
                           chosen and preferred before other men, as qualified for the divine ministry, to offer up gifts, oblations, sacrifices, in
                           order to obtain forgiveness for his own sins and those of the people, who, by the experience he has of his own infirmities,
                           may <I>compassionate</I> others who offend through frailty or ignorance, every priest (excepting our Saviour Christ) being
                           a sinner. Nor must he take upon himself rashly and inconsiderately, for temporal motives, this sacred ministry, formidable
                           (says St. Gregory) even for the shoulders of Angels; he must consult God by prayer, follow the advice of his spiritual guides
                           and pious parents; by these means to know whether he has a call from God to this ministry, as Aaron had. (Witham) --- The
                           priest and pastor should never forget that he is a man and a sinner; that he is honoured with this divine ministry, to offer
                           sacrifice both for his own sins and for the sins of the faithful; that prayer should be his delight, the altar his centre,
                           and the sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ his supreme felicity. "This sacrifice of the Eucharist," says St. Augustine,
                           "has succeeded to all the ancient victims that were immolated of old, to signify the future sacrifice." (lib. 10. chap. xx.
                           de Civit. Dei.) As to the word <I>mass,</I> it was in use to signify this holy sacrifice of the altar above thirteen hundred
                           years ago. See the second Council of Carthage, canon 3.; St. Jerome upon the Prov. chap. xi.; St. Ambrose, lib. 2. ep. 14.
                           Missam facere c&#339;pi; I began to say mass. It was introduced into this country [of Great Britain] with Christianity itself.

                           in 3 Kings xiii.; 2 Paralipomenon xxvi.; and 1 Kings xiii. the manifest punishments of the Almighty on laics that impiously
                           and sacrilegiously attempted the ministry of priests. In the Christian dispensation, archbishop Cranmer, the very soul of
                           the pretended reformation, dictatorially pronounces, "he that is appointed to be a bishop or priest, needeth no consecration:"
                           words quoted by Dr. Stillingfleet from his own handwriting, in his Irenicum, p. 391, 2nd ed. But the Catholic Church has given
                           a very different decision, which is confirmed by the testimony of Scripture, apostolical tradition, and the unanimous consent
                           of the Fathers. See Acts vi. 6. and xiii. 3. and xiv. 22.; 1 Timothy iv. 14. &amp;c. See in the history of Socrates, who lived
                           in the fifth century, how the usurpation of Ischyras, in taking upon himself the name and office of a priest without receiving
                           <I>holy orders,</I> was reprobated as a crime worthy of death. (lib. 1. chap. xxvii. Ed. Val.)</FONT></P><B>

                           may perhaps wonder why St. Paul does not dwell more in this epistle on the eucharistic sacrifice; but until the Hebrews understood
                           the <I>bloody</I> sacrifice on the cross, they could not be supposed to understand the <I>unbloody</I> sacrifice of the altar.
                           The holy Fathers observe, that the sacrifice of Melchisedech, (Genesis xiv. 18.) offered in bread and wine, prefigured the
                           unbloody sacrifice offered by Jesus Christ at his last supper. See Clement of Alexandria, lib. 4. Strom. chap. viii.; St.
                           Cyprian, lib. 2. ep. 3. ad Cæul.; Eusebius of Cæsarea, lib. 5. Dem. Evang. chap. iii.; St. Jerome, ad Marcel.; St. Augustine,
                           ep. 95. ad Inn. Pap.; St. Ambrose; St. Epiphanius; St. Chrysostom; &amp;c. apud Bellarmine, lib. 1. de missa. chap. vi. Hence
                           it follows, that the holy Eucharist is truly and properly a sacrifice as well as a sacrament, as the paschal lamb or passover
                           of the old law was both a sacrament and sacrifice. For either our Saviour offered sacrifice at his last supper under the forms
                           of bread and wine, or he cannot be called <I>a priest forever according to the order of Melchisedech.</I> For the different
                           orders of priests are chiefly distinguished by their sacrifice; (see ver. 1.) and if it be supposed that our Saviour only
                           offered a bloody sacrifice, he would with more propiety have been called a priest according to the order of Aaron, and not
                           of Melchisedech. See St. Augustine, lib. 16. de Civitat. Dei. chap. xxii.</FONT></P><B>

                           in the days of his flesh,</I> of his mortal and suffering condition, even with strong and fervent crying out, and tears, offering
                           up as man, <I>prayers and supplications to him,</I> to God, <I>who could save him from death;</I> to wit, in the garden of
                           Gethsemani, and on the cross, yet with a perfect resignation and conformity of his human will to the divine will, <I>was heard
                           for his reverence.</I>[1] I leave this translation, which is in the Rhemes Testament, very literal from the Latin Vulgate,
                           and which cannot be said to be any ways disagreeable to the Greek. As to the sense, there are two expositions in the best
                           interpreters. St. Chrysostom and many others understand, that he was heard as to every prayer that he made absolutely, and
                           not conditionally only, (as when he prayed that the cup of his sufferings might pass from him) and he <I>was heard for </I>that
                           <I>reverence,</I> reverential regard, and just consideration which the eternal Father had for him, who was his true Son. This
                           interpretation agrees better with the Greek text, in which is left out the word <I>his.</I> Others by his <I>reverence,</I>
                           understand that he was heard on account of that reverential fear, that respectful submission and piety, which he always had
                           towards his eternal Father. And if it be asked in what Christ was not heard, and in what he was heard: he was not heard when
                           he said, let this cup of sufferings, or this death, pass from me, because it was not what he asked and prayed for with an
                           absolute desire, but only thereby expressed the natural fear which, as man, he had of death, and therefore presently added,
                           but <I>not my will but thine be done,</I> expressing what he knew to be the divine will. And to shew this, St. Chrysostom
                           on these words, brings all those sentences by which our Saviour, Christ, had declared that he had power to lay down his life,
                           and power to take it up again; that no one taketh it from him, but that he laid it down of himself. See John x. 18. and St.
                           Chrysostom, hom. vii. p. 475. But Christ was heard in all he prayed for with an absolute will, according to what he said to
                           his Father, <I>I know that thou always hearest me.</I> (John xi. 42.) He was heard as to all that he asked with an absolute
                           will, either for himself or his Church. (Witham) --- What excellent dispositions these of Jesus Christ in his sacrifice, which
                           we learn from his apostles. How truly worthy are these tears both of our love and our adoration! Hence it appears, that Jesus
                           Christ in his prayer both in the garden and on the cross shed tears, though the evangelists are silent on this head. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           was heard in that he feared.</I> If the Rhemes translation, which I have not changed, be obscure, I much doubt whether theirs
                           can be better understood. I will not suppose that they mean with Calvin, that Christ was so abandoned on the cross as to be
                           driven to despair, and that he feared and felt the punishments of the damned, from which he begged to be freed, and was heard.
                           Beza, says Calvin, was the first author of this exposition, that is, of this blasphemy. I will rather suppose that the Protestant
                           translators only meant, that Christ, as man, feared death. How then <I>was he heard in that he feared?</I> not so as to be
                           freed from <SPAN lang=EN>death, which he willingly underwent, but was heard so as to triumph over death</SPAN>, and shortly
                           after to rise and ascend triumphant into heaven. Dr. Wells, in his amendments to the Protestant translation, has changed it
                           in this manner, <I>was heard</I> so as to be delivered from <I>his fear;</I> and in his paraphrase expounds it thus, <I>namely,
                           by an Angel sent on purpose to strengthen him;</I> so that he expounds this text of the fear and prayer of Christ in the garden,
                           from which <I>fear</I> he was freed at the appearing of the Angel. (Luke xxii. 43.) I pretend, notwithstanding, that the Protestant
                           translation, <I>was heard in that he feared,</I> though we take it with the additions made by Dr. Wells, <I>was heard</I>
                           so as to be delivered from <I>his fear,</I> is far from being exact, nor can it be looked upon as a proper and literal translation
                           from the Greek text,&nbsp;<I><U>apo tes eulabeias</U>.</I> First, where is there any thing in the Greek for <I>he feared,</I>
                           or <I>his</I> fear? or that <I>he</I> was delivered from <I>his</I> fear? This is to add in the text itself a particular exposition,
                           which at the same time is contrary to what divers interpreters take to be the literal sense of these words,&nbsp;<I><U>apo
                           tes eulabeias</U>,</I> who by&nbsp;<I><U>eulabeias</U></I> understand that great respect and regard which was <I>in the Father</I>
                           towards Christ, because he was his Son. St. Chrysostom understood the force of the Greek text as well as any one, and this
                           seems the meaning of these his words: (<I><U>log. e</U>,</I> p. 475, linea 20. Ed. Sav.)&nbsp;<I><U>tosaue en autou e eulabeia,
                           os kai apo toutou aideisthai auton ton theon</U>.</I> Nor does the Latin translator of St. Chrysostom, Mutius Scholasticus,
                           in the edition of Fronto Ducæus, seem to have mistaken the sense of St. Chrysostom, where we find, (hom. viii. p. 1478) <I>tanta
                           fuit ejus reverentia, ac pietas, ut <SPAN lang=EN>ideò </SPAN>eum revereretur Deus.</I> Others indeed expound it of the reverential
                           and godly fear, or piety, that was in Christ, as man, towards God, his Father, and that his prayers were heard on this account:
                           but this will not justify the Protestant translation, <I>that he was heard in that he feared,</I> not the paraphrase of Dr.
                           Wells, <I>so as to be delivered from his fear,</I> as if by&nbsp;<I><U>eulabeias</U></I> were understood merely a natural
                           fear and apprehension. I find Mr. Legh, in his Critica Sacra, on the word&nbsp;<I><U>eulabeias</U>,</I> says that the Syriac
                           version has <I>from fear:</I> but he is mistaken, as may be seen in Walton's Polyglot: the Syriac has only, <I>he was heard,</I>
                           without any mention at all of any kind of fear, which is left out. Mr. Legh says, Nazianzen[St. Gregory of Nazianzus] and
                           Theodoret follow this sense. He cites not the words nor the places. It must be again his mistake. Theodoret has nothing like
                           it in his commentary on this passage, nor St. Gregory (orat. xxxvi.) where he cites these words of St. Paul. It is true&nbsp;<I><U>eulabeias</U>,</I>
                           especially in profane authors, has sometimes the same signification as <I>timor,</I> or <I>metus.</I> It is, says Scapula,
                           timiditas circumspecta; but also, even in profane writers, the same as, religio, pietas in Deum. See also what examples Scapula
                           brings on&nbsp;<I><U>eulaboumai</U></I> and&nbsp;<I><U>eulabes</U>;</I> on which he says, apud Ecclesiasticos Scriptores,
                           et in Test. Novi libris, circumspectus et cautus circa ea quæ ad cultum divinum pertinent, religiosus, pius, ut Luc. 2. I
                           know also, that in Hebrews xi. 7., it is said of Noe[Noah], <I><SPAN lang=EN>metùens</SPAN>,</I> in the vulgar Latin, for&nbsp;<I><U>eulabetheis</U>;</I>
                           and in Acts xxiii. 10. Tribunus timens,&nbsp;<I><U>eulabetheis</U>;</I> but neither do these two examples shew that in this
                           place, where mention is made of our Saviour Christ,&nbsp;<I><U>eulabeia</U></I> can be properly and literally translated by
                           <I>fear,</I> or that the sense is that Christ <I>was heard</I> so as to <I>be delivered from his fear.</I> For first, this
                           exposition of fear and apprehension of death agrees not with the common exposition of the ancient Fathers, neither with St.
                           Chrysostom and those who follow him, nor with the others, as I have shewn already. Secondly, this translation agrees not with
                           the Protestant translation in other places. As for the <I>substantive,&nbsp;<U>eulabeia</U>,</I> it is only found in one other
                           place in the New Testament, to wit, Hebrews xii. 28.,&nbsp;<I><U>meta aidous, kai eulabeias</U>,</I> where the Protestant
                           translation has <I>with reverence and godly fear;</I> and for the adjective,&nbsp;<I><U>eulabes</U>,</I> where old Simeon
                           is called&nbsp;<I><U>eulabes</U></I> in the common Greek copies, (Luke ii. 25.) they have translated, a <I>devout</I> man.
                           In Acts viii. 2., the men that buried St. Stephen,&nbsp;<I><U>andres eulabeis</U>,</I> are translated <I>devout men,</I> as
                           also in Acts ii. 5. Thirdly, the ancient Arabic version signifies <I>propter reverentiam ejus,</I> and the Ethiopic <I>ob
                           justitiam ejus,</I> as they are in the translations of Walton, which agree with the Latin Vulgate, but not with that sense
                           in which the English Protestants have translated the Greek. In fine, it must be observed that&nbsp;<I><U>apo</U></I> here,
                           according to these versions, bears the sense of <I>ob</I> or <I>propter,</I> and not of <I>ab</I> or <I>ex,</I> of which signification
                           see many examples in Estius. (Witham)</FONT></P></FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>
