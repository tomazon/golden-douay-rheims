                           saw a beast coming out of the sea.</I> By this first beast several understand antichrist, as St. Irenæus, lib. v. chap. xxviii.
                           and St. Gregory, lib. xxxi. Moral. chap. xli. But this is not certain. By the <I>other beast</I>[1] <I>coming up out of the
                           earth,</I> (ver. 11) many understand antichrist's false prophet, some famous impostor and magician in antichrist's time, who
                           will do great wonders and signs. The <I>seven heads and ten horns,</I> may again signify a great number of kings and princes,
                           who shall be overcome by antichrist, and submit themselves to him. The <I>dragon,</I> or devil, gives that great power to
                           antichrist, signified by the different parts of the beast, some like to a <I>leopard,</I> others to a <I>bear,</I> and others
                           to a <I>lion.</I> The head <I>wounded to death</I> and cured, is either antichrist himself or some one of those heads or kings,
                           cured by the devil and diabolical arts after a mortal wound. (Witham) --- This first beast, with seven heads and ten horns,
                           is probably the whole company of infidels, enemies and persecutors of the people of God, from the beginning to the end of
                           the world. The seven heads are seven kings, that is, seven principal kingdoms or empires; which have exercised, or shall exercise,
                           tyrannical power over the people of God: of these, five were then fallen, viz. the Egyptian, Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian,
                           and Grecian monarchies: one was present, viz. the empire of Rome: and the seventh and the chiefest was to come, viz. the great
                           antichrist and his empire. The ten horns may be understood of ten lesser persecutors. (Challoner) </FONT></P><B>

                           bishop of Meaux, observes in the emperors Maximian Herculeus, Galerius Maximin, and Dioclesian, the distinguishing characters
                           of these three animals. The leopard represents Maximian, a changeable, restless and cruel prince. The bear figures Galerius
                           Maximin, a man from the north of cruel and brutal disposition, terrible mein, and gigantic stature. Lactantius moreover informs
                           us, that he took a pleasure in feeding bears, which bore so great a resemblance to him in size and brutality. The lion, in
                           fine, is the symbol of Dioclesian, who was cruel and vehement against Christians. (Calmet) --- The whole of this is by Pastorini
                           applied to the empire of Rome, which was composed of the territories of the three preceding empires, which are represented
                           by Daniel under the figure of these animals. And as the body of the beast was like to a leopard, the centre and capital of
                           the Roman empire, under antichrist will be the Grecian empire, denoted by the leopard, of which Constantinople became the
                           capital. Various interpreters explain the whole of this vision by different ways. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           be done by false prophets, (Matthew xxiv. 24) making even fire by lightning come from heaven, as the devil was permitted to
                           do in the time of Job. (Job i.) --- <I>He caused </I>men <I>to adore the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed,</I> and
                           the image of the first beast, of antichrist, to be adored, and that no one should buy or sell any thing, unless he had on
                           his forehead or on his arm, some particular mark, called the <I>character</I> of this false Christ, or antichrist; or his
                           name, or the number of his name, that is, his name which was made up of numeral letters, 666; but as St. Irenæus thinks, in
                           Greek letters or characters, as St. John wrote his Revelation in Greek. According to the application made by the bishop of
                           Meaux, &amp;c. by the first beast with seven horns were signified the cruel persecutors of the Church, Dioclesian and other
                           six persecuting emperors, to wit, Maximian Herculeus, Galerius Maximian, Constantius Chlorus (father to Constantine), Maxentius,
                           Maximinus, and Licinius. These they look upon to have been the seven heads of the first beast, and by this beast they understand
                           the idolatry of the heathen Roman empire; and by the <I>ten horns,</I> a great many barbarous nations, who in their time made
                           irruptions and pillaged the empire, and afterwards brought destruction upon the whole Roman empire, to wit, the Goths, Vandals,
                           and the rest. The resemblances of a leopard, bear, and lion, are introduced with an allusion to what is written by the prophet
                           Daniel, (Daniel vii.) meaning the four great empires: by the leopard, that of the Chaldeans; by the bear, that of the Persians;
                           by the lion, that of the Grecians and of Alexander the great; lastly, that of the Romans, which is not represented by any
                           one beast, but as a compound of others. When it is said that the beast had received a mortal wound, and was <I>cured again,</I>
                           these interpreters understand the idolatry of the empire, which was in a great measure destroyed by Constantine, but which
                           was again revived and renewed by Julian the apostate. He might well be said to have a <I>mouth speaking great things and blasphemies;</I>
                           but his power lasted only for a short time, signified by forty-two months, though literally he did not reign so long. By the
                           <I>other beast,</I> (ver. 11) these interpreters, as also Dr. Hammond, understand the philosophers and magicians, with their
                           auguries and pretended oracles of the heathen gods. For these men, under Dioclesian, and particularly under Julian, were constantly
                           exciting the emperors and the people against the Christians, telling them that the gods required that the religion of the
                           Christians should be utterly destroyed. We find in the histories of those times, that an <I>image</I> or statue was erected
                           to Julian, together with Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury, and orders given to put to death all those who refused to adore that
                           image. See St. Gregory of Nazianzus, Orat. 3. contra Julianum, and Sozomen, lib. v. Hist. chap. xvii. Under Dioclesian, and
                           also under Julian, meats offered to idols, were thrown into fountains; and waters consecrated to idols, were sprinkled upon
                           all things to be sold in the market, to the end that the Christians might be defiled by every thing that they bought or eat.
                           As to the number of the name of the beast, 666, in these Greek letters,&nbsp;<I><U><STRONG>chxs</STRONG></U>,</I> nothing
                           can be produced but mere conjecture. St. Irenæus[3] (lib. v. chap. xxx. p. 371. Ed. Feuardentii) says, that according to the
                           testimony of those who had seen St. John, the number of the beast was to be computed by Greek letters. He takes notice that
                           this number of 666 may be found in several names. He produces some examples, and amongst others the word Lateinos; of which
                           he says, it may seem very likely that this is the name, because the last of the four empires, which were spoken of by the
                           prophet Daniel, was then extant, and had this name of the empire of the Latins. Take notice, that he has not a word that hints
                           at the Latin Church, as some of the late pretended reformation would insinuate. But, says he, the word Teitan carries with
                           it a greater probability. Yet, he concludes, that such expositions are uncertain, and he will not venture to say that this
                           will be the name. The bishop of Meaux proposes, DIoCLesAVgVstVs: but this is to look for it in Latin letters. Others have
                           produced other names. Such fancies and conjectures seem full as well omitted. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           chap. xli.) by the first of these two beasts understand antichrist, and others would have antichrist to be meant by one of
                           the two, yet this is not to be looked upon as absolutely certain, not being witnessed by the consent of primitive Fathers.
                           The ancient Fathers, especially in the exposition of obscure prophecies, many times give us no more than their private opinions,
                           or suspicions and conjectures, as St. Augustine expressly takes notice in the 20th book de Civ. Dei[City of God], (chap. xix.
                           tom. 7. p. 597. Nov. Ed.) where he speaks of antichrist: so that though St. Irenæus had seen St. Polycarp, who was a disciple
                           of St. John the evangelist, yet he delivers us divers things concerning antichrist, which are no more than his private opinions
                           and conjectures, in which others do not agree with him; as that antichrist shall be of the tribe of Dan; that he shall sit
                           in the temple of Jerusalem. He was also in an error as to Christ's reign of a thousand years upon the earth with his elect.
                           Arethas, bishop of C<SPAN lang=EN>æ</SPAN>sarea, in Cappadocia, in the sixth age[century], in his commentary on the Apocalypse,
                           (tom. vi. Bib. Patrum, Edit. Colon) speaking of this opinion, that some would have the first beast (Apocalypse xiii. 1.) to
                           be antichrist, and others the second beast, only says: quidam sic accipiunt, &amp;c. </FONT></P>

                           Another wild beast. St. Irenæus calls this second beast <I>armigerum prim&#339;,</I> and takes notice that he is also called
                           in other places of the Apocalypse (Chap. xvi. 13. and xix. 20. and xx. 10.) the false prophet, <I>pseudopropheta</I> of the
                           first beast. By what is said in this chapter, this second beast must live and act at the same time with the first; for it
                           is said, ver. 12, that he exercised all the power of the former beast <I>in his sight,&nbsp;<U>enopion autou</U>;</I> and
                           again, ver. 14, that he did <I>wonders in the sight of the </I>first beast,&nbsp;<I><U>enopion</U></I><U> </U><I><U>tou theriou</U>.</I>
                           <STRONG>2.</STRONG> It is said that this second beast made all that <I>dwelt on the earth adore the first</I> beast. <STRONG>3.</STRONG>
                           That he made all persons make an <I>image to the first beast,</I> that was wounded and cured, and that they should be <I>slain
                           who adored not that image.</I> <STRONG>4.</STRONG> He caused that all persons should have the character of the first beast,
                           and the <I>number of his name,</I> i.e. of the name of the first beast. All those who hold that the first beast in this chapter
                           is antichrist, who is to come a little before the end of the world, hold in like manner that the second beast is not come,
                           but will also come at the same time; and that he is to be a famous imposter and false prophet in antichrist's time. But they
                           who hold the first beast not to be antichrist, but to be the idolatry of heathen Rome, by the second beast understand the
                           philosophers and magicians, who were accustomed to raise the indignation of the pagan emperors against Christians. This exposition
                           of the bishop of Meaux, and of divers Catholic interpreters, I shall here give in Dr. Hammond's words: "By the second beast
                           is meant magic, auguries, and oracles of heathens, made use of to advance idol worship. This beast had two horns, two powers,
                           with some resemblance of Christ, the Lamb; the power of doing some kind of miracles, even of making fire seem to come down
                           from heaven, as Philostratus relates of Apollonius of Tyanea, (lib. v. chap. v.) and the pretended power of prophecy by dubious
                           and obscure oracles; by which also they engaged the emperors to promote idolatry, and to make bloody edicts against Christianity,
                           to force every one to join in their heathen worship, and to shew that they did so by exterior marks and signs, by tickets,
                           to shew that they had sacrificed to idols, otherwise they should be incapable of buying and selling, i.e. of enjoying any
                           particular advantages, or the common benefits of life." Dr. Hammond did not think it worth taking notice of, that so many
                           writers of the pretended reformation would have the second beast to be a great many popes, whom they affirm to be the&nbsp;famous
                           antichrist. Never was there a more groundless or a more malicious invention, without shadow of authority or reason, and evidently
                           contradictory to both, which I may shew as occasion offers, and as far as these short notes will permit. Here I shall only
                           touch upon what relates to that which is said in this chapter. <STRONG>1.</STRONG> The late reformers, some of them, make
                           the first beast the popish antichrist, (as we may see in the bishop of Meaux, and also in Dr. Wells) and some affirm this
                           of the second beast. The two beasts are quite different: are they both the popish antichrist? <STRONG>2.</STRONG> Some of
                           them prove the popes to be the second beast, because the pope's mitre has a resemblance of his two horns: does this deserve
                           an answer? See the bishop of Meaux. <STRONG>3.</STRONG> Is it not as ridiculous to pretend that <I>by fire</I> coming <I>from
                           heaven,</I> is meant the pope's excommunications? Is not the power of excommunication grounded in St. Paul? Do not the Protestants
                           themselves own, and make use of this power? <STRONG>4.</STRONG> Those Protestants who tell us the second beast is the popish
                           antichrist, say that the first beast was the state of paganism in the Roman empire. This, as they own, was destroyed before
                           the popes began to be antichrist: how does this agree with what is here said of the second beast, antichrist's armiger, that
                           he exercised all his power in <I>the sight</I> and in the presence of the first <EM>beast?</EM> <STRONG>5.</STRONG> How can
                           they pretend that the popes ever ordered all to be slain who would not adore the first beast? (that is, heathen idols, or
                           the images of heathen gods, of Jupiter, Mars, &amp;c.) or who did not bear on his forehead or hand the <I>character,</I> the
                           mark, or the <I>number</I> of some of their heathen gods or heathen emperors? <STRONG>6.</STRONG> If the second beast be the
                           popish antichrist, all those Protestants have been guilty of a grievous oversight, who have endeavoured to prove the popes
                           antichrist, by finding the number 666 in their names, or in the word Lateinos; for it is evident by this chapter, (ver. 17)
                           that the number of the name belongs to the first beast, and not to the second. <STRONG>7.</STRONG> This contradicts what the
                           Protestants teach with St. Paul (2 Thessalonians. ii.) that antichrist is to be <I>the man of sin,</I> who will make himself
                           adored <EM>above all that is called or worshipped as God;</EM> whereas, in this place of the Apocalypse, the second beast
                           does not make himself, but the first beast, to be adored. Therefore this second beast is not the popish antichrist. Of this
                           more in the following chapters. </FONT></P>
