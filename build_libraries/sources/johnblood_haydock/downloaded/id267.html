                           which</I> (to wit, soul or spirit) <I>also he came, and preached to those spirits who were in prison.</I> The true and common
                           interpretation of this place seems to be, that the soul of Christ, after the separation from the body and before the resurrection,
                           descended to a place in the interior parts of the earth, called <I>hell</I> in that which we call the apostles' creed, (sometimes
                           called Abraham's bosom, sometimes Limbus Patrum[Limbo of the Fathers], a place where were detained all the souls of the patriarchs,
                           prophets, and just men, as it were in prison) and preached to these spirits in this prison; i.e. brought them this happy news,
                           that he who was their <SPAN lang=EN>Redeemer was now come to be their deliverer, and that at his glorious ascension they should
                           enter with him into heaven, where none could enter before our Redeemer</SPAN>, who opened as it were heaven's gates. Among
                           these were many who had been formerly at first incredulous in the time of Noe[Noah], who would not take warning from his preparing
                           and building the ark, but it may be reasonably supposed that many of them repented of their sins when they saw the danger
                           approaching, and before they perished by the waters of the deluge, so that they died at least not guilty of eternal damnation;
                           because, though they were sinners, yet they worshipped the true God, for we do not find any proofs of idolatry before the
                           deluge. These then, and all the souls of the just, Christ descended to free from their captivity, from their prison, and to
                           lead them at his ascension triumphant with him into heaven. The Church of England cannot quarrel with this exposition, which
                           seems altogether conformable to the third of their thirty-nine articles, which at present runs thus: "As Christ died for us,
                           and was buried, so also it is to be believed that he went down into hell." It is thus expressed in the articles under queen
                           Elizabeth, in the year 1562; and in the articles put out ten years before, in the year 1552, in the fourth year of king Edward
                           the sixth, the words were: "that the body of Christ lay in the grave until his resurrection, but the spirit which he gave
                           up was with the spirits which were detained in prison, or in hell, and preached to them, as the place in St. Peter testifieth."
                           Dr. Pearson on the fifth article of the creed, writes thus: "There is nothing which the Fathers agree in more, than as to
                           a local and real descent of the soul of Christ into the infernal parts, unto the habitation of the souls departed....This
                           was the general opinion of the Church, as may appear by the testimonies of those ancient writers, who lived successively and
                           wrote in several ages, and delivered this exposition in such express terms as are not capable of any other interpretation."
                           Thus Dr. Pearson. He cites the Fathers. See the edition, in the year 1683, p. 237. (Witham) --- <I>Prison.</I> See here a
                           proof of a third place, or middle state of souls: for these spirits in prison, to whom Christ went to preach after his death,
                           were not in heaven, nor yet in the hell of the damned; because heaven is no prison, and Christ did not go to preach to the
                           damned. (Challoner) --- St. Augustine, in his 99th epistle, confesses that this text is replete with difficulties. This he
                           declares is clear, beyond all doubt, that Jesus Christ descended in soul after his death into the regions below, and concludes
                           with these words: Quis ergo nisi infidelis negaverit fuisse apud inferos Christum? In this prison souls would not be detained
                           unless they were indebted to divine justice, nor would salvation be preached to them unless they were in a state that was
                           capable of receiving salvation.</FONT></P><B>

                           the waters of the deluge but those few eight persons who were in the ark, so no one can enter into heaven if he hath not been
                           baptized, or hath had a desire of it when come to the use of reason. And such persons as are capable of knowing what they
                           receive, must come with the dispositions of faith and a true repentance, which is here called <I>the examination</I> (literally,

                           Persons, &amp;c. (Witham) --- Baptism is said to be the like form with the water by which Noe[Noah] was saved, because the
                           one was a figure of the other. --- <I>Not the putting away,</I> &amp;c. As much as to say, that baptism has not its efficacy,

                           &amp;c., which also Dr. Pearson sets down at large. The late Protestant writers, as may be seen in Dr. Hammond and Dr. Wells,
                           expound this place so as to signify no real descent of Christ's soul into hell, or to any infernal place, but only that his
                           divine spirit sent Noe[Noah] to preach to the spirits in the prison of their body, (i.e. to those wicked men who lived in
                           the days of Noe) to exhort them to repentance. But this exposition, as Dr. Pearson observed, is against the general opinion
                           of the Church and the ancient Fathers; and of which St. Augustine said, (Epis. 163. tom. 2. p. 574) Quis nisi infidelis negaverit,
