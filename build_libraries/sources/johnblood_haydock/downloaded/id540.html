                           that the curse fell upon Azan (Hiel) of Bethel, 3 Kings xvi. 34. Before his time, there was a city of palm-trees, or Jericho,
                           built in the neighbourhood. (Josephus, Jewish Wars v. 4.) Though Hiel was so severely punished, no one made any scruple to
                           live there. Elias and Jesus Christ himself honoured the place with their presence. The city is now almost in ruins, and the
                           territory uncultivated. Ancient history mentions similar imprecations against obnoxious cities. Thus the Romans cursed the
                           rebuilders of Carthage, and Agamemnon followed "the ancient custom," says Strabo, (xiii.) laying a curse upon those who should
                           rebuild the city of Troy. The Ionians and Greeks forbad those temples to be re-established, which the Persians had destroyed,
                           that they might remain eternal monuments of the impiety of the latter, and of the hatred which subsisted between the two nations.

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 And the Lord said to Josue: Behold I have given into thy hands Jericho,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 And on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven trumpets, which

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken tune,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 Then Josue, the son of Nun, called the priests, and said to them: Take

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And he said to the people: Go, and compass the city, armed, marching

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And when Josue had ended his words, and the seven priests blew the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And all the armed men went before, the rest of the common people followed
                                    the ark, and the sound of the trumpets was heard on all sides.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 But Josue had commanded the people, saying: You shall not shout, nor

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And Josue rising before day, the priests took the ark of the Lord,</font></p>

                                    of the common people followed the ark, and they blew the trumpets.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And they went round about the city the second day once, and returned

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 But the seventh day, rising up early, they went about the city, as

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And when in the seventh going about the priests sounded with the trumpets,
                                    Josue said to all Israel: Shout: for the Lord hath delivered the city to you:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And let this city be an anathema, and all things that are in it, to
                                    the Lord. Let only Rahab, the harlot, live, with all that are with her in the house: *for she hid the messengers whom we sent.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are forbidden,
                                    and you be guilty of transgression, and all the camp of Israel be under sin, and be troubled.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be, or vessels of brass

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 *So all the people making a shout, and the trumpets sounding, when
                                    the voice and the sound thundered in the ears of the multitude, the walls forthwith fell down: and every man went up by the
                                    place that was over-against him: **and they took the city,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And killed all that were in it, man and woman, young and old. The
                                    oxen also, and the sheep, and the asses, they slew with the edge of the sword.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 *But Josue said to the two men that had been sent for spies: Go into

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 *And the young men went in, and brought out Rahab, and her parents,
                                    her brethren also, and all her goods, and her kindred, and made them to stay without the camp.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 *But they burned the city, and all things that were therein; except
                                    the gold and silver, and vessels of brass and iron, which they consecrated unto the treasury of the Lord.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 But Josue saved Rahab the harlot, and her father's house, and all
                                    she had, and they dwelt in the midst of Israel until this present day: because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to
                                    spy out Jericho. At that time, Josue made an imprecation, saying:</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And the Lord was with Josue, and his name was noised throughout all
