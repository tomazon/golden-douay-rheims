                           to the Christian faith, and were now reduced to the greatest want. It is for the support of their brethren in Palestine that
                           the charitable contributions here mentioned by St. Paul, were raised in the Churches of Macedon. (Calmet) --- In the Greek

                           in our alms: first, the zeal and good-will with which we give our alms; secondly, the greatness of our charities, that is,
                           if they be proportionate to our means. If you have little, give a little, but with good-will; if you have much, give also
                           much, but with equal benevolence and zeal. God measures the extent of our charity by the greatness of our zeal, not requiring
                           of us what we have not, but what we have to spare, relieving others, without overcharging ourselves. (Bible de Vence) ---

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich, he
                                    became poor for your sakes: that through his poverty you might be rich.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And in this I give counsel: for this is profitable for you, who have

                                    in the heart of Titus.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation: but being more careful, of
                                    his own will he went unto you.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 We have sent also with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel
