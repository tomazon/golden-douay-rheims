                           The most ancient idols were not finely carved, but only rough stones. The Phrygian goddess, sent to Rome by Attalus, was a

                           Some confine this to the sacrifices, which each person might offer, where he thought proper, till the ark was fixed at Silo.
                           But many other parts of the ceremonial law, seem not to have been in force till the Hebrews crossed the Jordan, Amos v. 25.
                           Circumcision was omitted, as well as most of the festivals. Several laws were, however, designed for the people during their
                           sojournment, such as those which regard the order of judgment, the cleanness of the camp, the purification of women, and of
                           those who had touched a dead body, &amp;c., Exodus xviii. 25., Numbers v. 2., and Leviticus xv. 31. It was not left to their
                           option to observe or to neglect the sabbath, (Numbers xv. 32,) the loaves of proposition, or the perpetual fire, &amp;c.,

                           Hebrew, "Yet thou mayst kill and eat the flesh which thy soul desireth in all thy gates, with which the Lord thy God hath
                           blessed thee, the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roe buck," &amp;c. (Haydock) --- The Vulgate translates
                           ver. 22 in this sense, intimating that these meats did not contract any such peculiar sanctity, as to exclude those who were
                           unclean, ver. 20., and Leviticus xvii. 3. Fagius pretends, that only the clean were allowed as yet to eat of such meats, though
                           the unclean might eat in the promised land what was lawful, without bringing the beast to be slain before the tabernacle.
                           But this opinion seems to have no solid foundation. Unclean beasts could never be eaten. (Calmet) --- But those which had
                           any defect, were excluded from being sacrificed, Leviticus xxii. 22. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           These were of an extraordinary nature, destined for feasts, chap. xiv. 22., and Leviticus xxvii. 30. The usual tithes belonged
                           entirely to the Levitical tribe. (Calmet) --- <I>First-born,</I> or the most excellent, ver. 11., and Exodus xii. 11, 12.

                           If the thing was vowed to the Lord without restriction, it fell to the share of the priests alone: but if the person specified

                           and are hereby authorized to follow the same regulations, and to eat the flesh, whether they be clean or otherwise, provided
                           they abstain from the blood. See Leviticus xvii. 3. (Calmet) --- The custom of bringing the beasts to be slain before the

                           This must be understood of those who had contracted only a smaller stain, which did not communicate the uncleanness to others,

                           See Genesis ix. 4. Blood maintains the life of animals, and it would seem cruel to begin to eat them before they were perfectly

                           no one has dared to retrench any thing from, (the sacred books) or to make any addition to them. We look upon them as of divine
                           authority,....and we would lay down our lives, if necessary, to defend them. (Calmet) Among us, who believe that the law was
                           first given by the will of God, nothing is pious but the exact observance of it. For who can introduce any change, or invent
                           any thing better?" (Chap. iv. 2.) Christ is <I>full of grace and truth,</I> John i. He has fulfilled the law and the prophets.
