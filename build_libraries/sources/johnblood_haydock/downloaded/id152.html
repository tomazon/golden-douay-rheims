                           They are the sons of God, by this new grace of adoption, by which also they call God, <I>Abba;</I> that is to say, <I>Father,</I>
                           whereas under the former law of Moses, God rather governed his people <I>by fear;</I> they were his <I>servants,</I> we are
                           his <I>sons;</I> and if sons, also <I>the heirs of God,</I> with the promise of an eternal inheritance in his kingdom,<I>
                           provided we suffer </I>for Christ's sake, as he suffered for us. And surely the short sufferings in this world have no proportion,
                           nor can be put in balance with the <I>future</I> endless glory, which is promised and prepared for us in heaven. (Witham)
                           --- <I>Abba</I> is a Syriac word, which signifies my father. This is properly the word of free and noble children; for amongst
                           the Hebrews, the children of slaves were not allowed to call their fathers<I> Abba,</I> nor their mothers <I>Imma.</I> This
                           kind of expression was very rarely used under the old law. The Hebrews called the Almighty their Lord, their God, their Salvation,
                           their King, their Protector, their Glory, &amp;c. but seldom their father, scarcely ever, except in the case of Solomon, who
                           was a particular figure of the Messias, the true Son of God. On this account God said to him: "He shall call me Father and
                           God; and I will be to him a Father, and will treat as my first-born." But it is the property of the Christian to call the
                           Almighty his Father with confidence indeed, yet tempered with a filial awe; remembering at the same time that he is his judge.
                           (Calmet) --- Mat. Polus says that not any one of the just dared to call God, my <I>Father,</I> before the coming of Christ,
                           as this favour was reserved for the time of the gospel. (In this location.) (Haydock) --- St. Chrysostom[1] takes notice,
                           that God was also called the Father of the Israelites, and they his <I>children,</I> in the Old Testament, when God rather
                           governed his people by fear of punishments, and promises of temporal blessings, but not in that particular manner as in the
                           new law. (Witham) --- <I>The Spirit himself,</I> &amp;c. By the inward motions of divine love, and the peace of conscience,
                           which the children of God experience, they have a kind of testimony of God's favour; by which they are much strengthened in
                           the hope of their justification and salvation; but yet not so as to pretend to an absolute assurance, which is not usually
                           granted in this mortal life: during which we are taught to <I>work out our salvation with fear and trembling.</I> (Philippians
                           ii. 12.) And <I>that he who thinketh himself to stand, must take heed lest he fall.</I> (1 Corinthians x. 12.) See also Romans
                           xi. 20, 21, 22. (Challoner) --- <I>He hath given to us,</I> says St. John, (chap. i. 12.) <I>the power,</I> or dignity, <I>of
                           being the sons of God.</I> Christ taught us to pray, and to begin our prayers with <I>our Father,</I> &amp;c. (Matthew vi.
                           9.) (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           occasion of his sin made subject to vanity, that is, to a perpetual instability, tending to corruption and other defects;
                           so that by a figure of speech, it is here said to groan and be in labour, and to long for its deliverance, which is then to
                           come, when sin shall reign no more; and God shall raise the bodies, and united them to their souls, never more to separate,
                           and to be in everlasting happiness in heaven. (Challoner) --- <I>Waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God.</I> That is,
                           for the time after this life, when it shall be made manifest that they are the sons of God, and heirs of the kingdom of his
                           glory. Several interpreters understand all creatures whatsoever, even irrational and inanimate creatures of this world, which
                           are represented as if they had a knowledge and sense of a more happy condition, of a new unchangeable state of perfection,
                           which they are to receive at the end of the world. See 2 Peter i. 13; Apocalypse xxi. 1. Now every insensible creature is
                           figuratively brought in <I>groaning</I> like a woman in labour, <I>waiting,</I> and wishing for that new and happy state;
                           but in the mean time <I>unwillingly made subject to vanity,</I> i.e. to these changeable imperfections of generations and
                           corruptions, which then they shall be <I>delivered from.</I> (Witham) --- <I>The creature,</I> &amp;c. The creatures expect
                           with impatience, and hope with confidence, to see a happy change in their condition; they flatter themselves that they will
                           be delivered from the captivity of sin, to which man has reduced them, and enter into the liberty of the glory of the sons
                           of God. Not that the inanimate creation will really participate the happiness and glory of the elect; although in some sense
                           they may be said to have part in it, since they will enter into a pure, incorruptible and perfect state to the end of ages.
                           They will no longer be subject to those changes and vicissitudes which sin has brought upon them; nor will sinful man any
                           longer abuse their beauty and goodness in offending the Creator of all. St. Ambrose and St. Jerome teach that the sun, moon,
                           and stars will be then much more brilliant and beautiful than at present, no longer subject to those changes they at present
                           suffer. Philo and Tertullian teach that the beasts of prey will then lay aside their ferocity, and venomous serpents their

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 *For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear: but

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen, is not hope: For

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 But if we hope for that which we see not: we wait for it with patience.</font></p>
