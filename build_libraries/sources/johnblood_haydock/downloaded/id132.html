                           ceremonies of the Jewish law, and <I>of the Gentiles,</I> that is, of such as till that time had been heathens, and idolaters;
                           so that here three sorts of persons were converted by St. Paul: 1. <I>Jews;</I> 2. <I>worshippers</I> of the true God that
                           were not Jews; and 3. <I>Gentiles.</I> In this book of the Acts, mention is several times made of <I>worshippers,</I> to wit,
                           of God, by which many understand Jewish <I>proselytes:</I> but as they neither were Jews already, nor perhaps ever designed
                           to become Jews, we may distinguish two sorts of the Jewish proselytes. Some were <I>proselytes to the Jewish religion,</I>
                           by a submission to circumcision, and to all the precepts and ceremonies of the Mosaic laws. These are also by some called
                           <I>proselytes of the covenant,</I> being as much Jews as they who had been always so. Others are called <I>proselytes of the
                           gate,</I> or proselytes to the <I>God of the Jews,</I> but not to the religion of the Jews. Of such seems to have been Cornelius,
                           the centurion, (Acts x.) Lydia, (Acts xvi. 14.) and Titus Justus (Acts xviii. 7.) Such also seems to have been the eunuch
                           of Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians, (Acts viii.) Naaman, the Syrian, after he was cured of his leprosy, (4 Kings v. 17.)
                           and many others, that lived in Judea, and in other countries. These, therefore, are called <I>worshippers,</I> meaning of
                           the true God, though they embraced not the legal precepts and ceremonies of the Jews. See Monsr. Heure's Dictionary. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           of religion into one of temporal policy. The accusation of raising up a new power in opposition to Cæsar's, had been sufficiently
                           refuted and disavowed before Pilate by the author of our religion, and was therefore too gross to be repeated now. My kingdom,
                           says our blessed Saviour, is not of this world. There is no necessary connection between spiritual and temporal power. It
                           is thus that the abettors of persecution are never at a loss for pretexts, when necessary. Mad zeal is not scrupulously nice

                           In flying from the face of persecution in due season, St. Paul imitated the instruction and example of his master. When his
                           labours are unsuccessful in one place, he renews them in another, and wherever he is, his object is always the same, to announce
                           the truth to the Jews first, then to the Gentiles. (Denis the Carthusian)</FONT></P><B>

                           judges of their pastors, the people of the priests, and lay men and women of St. Paul's doctrine. The Ber&#339;ans did not
                           read the Old Testament (and the New was not then published) to dispute with the apostles, or to sanction his doctrines: but
                           it was a great comfort and confirmation to the Jews that had the Scriptures, to find, even as St. Paul said, that Christ was
                           God, crucified, risen, and ascended to heaven; which by his expounding they understood, and never before, though they read
                           them, and heard them read every sabbath. So it is a great comfort to a Catholic to see in the Scriptures the clear passages
                           that prove the truth of his tenets, and shew the grounds for his hopes. But this by no means authorizes him to be judge of
                           the true pastors of the Church, whom he is commanded by Jesus Christ to hear and obey, and from whom they are to learn the
                           genuine sense of the Scriptures.</FONT></P><B>

                           was no future state of retribution. The latter denied that man had liberty of action, and maintained, that all things happened
                           by destiny and fatal necessity. These were the two opposite sects St. Paul had to contend with. (Calmet) --- The Stoics believed
                           in the immortality of the soul, and came the nearest to the Christian religion: but both Stoics and Epicureans, with all pagan
                           philosophers, denied the resurrection of bodies; hence St. Augustine says, the faith of a resurrection is peculiar to Christians.

                           altar they designed to worship every god of any nation, who was not come to their knowledge: or to worship that great God
                           hinted at in the writings of Plato: or as others conjecture, that God of the Jews, of whom they might have heard such wonders,
                           and whose name the Jews themselves said to be unknown and ineffable. However, from this inscription St. Paul takes an occasion,
                           with wonderful dexterity, with sublime reflections, and with that solid eloquence, of which he was master, and which he employed,
                           as often as it was necessary, to inform them, and instruct them, concerning the works of the one true God, of whom they had
                           little knowledge, by their own fault: that this one true God <I>made the world, and all things in it:</I> that from <I>one</I>
                           man he raised all mankind: that his presence is not confined to temples made <I>by the hands of men,</I> being every where,
                           and in all creatures, preserving them every moment: that in him <I>we live, move, and have our being,</I> or subsist: that
                           it is he, who hath <I>determined</I> the <I>time, limits,</I> or bounds of every empire, and kingdom, and of every man's life:
                           that this true God, who made, preserves, and governs all things in <I>heaven and on earth,</I> cannot be like to gold, silver,
                           or any thing made by the art, or fancy of men. He puts them in mind that according even to one of their own heathen poets,
                           Aratus, men themselves are the <I>offspring of God,</I> being blessed with a being and knowledge above all other creatures
                           in this world: who by the light of reason ought to <I>seek God,</I> and by considering the visible effects of Providence over
                           the world, and the creatures in it, might come to the knowledge of this one God, the author of all, at least to an imperfect
                           knowledge of him, as men <I>find</I> out things <I>by feeling,</I> or as it were, groping in the dark. He then adds, (ver.
                           30.) that having, as it were, <I>overlooked,</I> and permitted men for many ages to run on in this ignorance and blindness,
                           in punishment of their sins, (this their ignorance of one true God, the author of all things, being wilful and inexcusable)
                           now the same true God hath been pleased to <I>announce to all men,</I> that henceforward they acknowledge, and worship him,
                           that they repent, and <I>do penance</I> for their sins. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           are not for God, but for man. It is the latter who derives assistance from them. The same may be observed of all exterior
                           acts of worship. They are serviceable, inasmuch as they proceed from, or powerfully assist, interior devotion, by the impressions
                           which exterior objects leave upon the soul. The reciprocal action of one upon the other, in our present state of existence,
                           is great and inevitable. (Haydock) See chap. vii. above, ver. 48. --- God, indeed, dwelleth in the temple, yes, and in the
                           soul of the just man, but he is not confined there, as the idols were to their temples. Hence the prayer of Solomon at the
                           consecration of the temple: if heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thy immensity, how much less this house, which
                           I have erected? God dwelleth there, then, to receive the prayers and sacrifices of the faithful, but not as <I>though he needed
                           any thing.</I> See ver. 25. --- God is not contained in temples; so as to need them for his dwelling, or any other uses, as
                           the heathens imagined. Yet by his omnipresence, he is both there and every where. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           says: "What writing does for readers, that a picture does for the ignorant; for in it they see what they ought to follow,
                           and in it they read, who know no letters." And he sharply rebukes Serenus's indiscreet zeal for removing pictures, instead

                           to that dignity. It is the same person, who, observing the convulsions of nature, which paid homage, as it were, to its God,

                                    but Silas and Timothy remained there.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens, and receiving
                                    a commandment from him to Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they departed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 *Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was excited
                                    within him, seeing the city given up to idolatry.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the Jews, and with them

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers disputed with him, and
                                    some said: What is it that this babbler would say? But others: He seemeth to be a preacher of new gods: because he preached
                                    to them Jesus, and the resurrection.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying: May we

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 For thou bringest certain new things to our ears: We would know, therefore,
                                    what these things mean.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 (Now all the Athenians, and strangers that were there, employed themselves
                                    in nothing else but either in telling or in hearing something new.)</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 But Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: Ye men of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 Being, therefore, the offspring of God, we must not suppose the Divinity
                                    to be like unto gold or silver, or stone, the graving of art, and device of man.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And God, indeed, having overlooked the times of this ignorance, now
