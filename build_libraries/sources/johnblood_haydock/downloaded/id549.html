                           God regulated the lots, as he had authorized Jacob and Moses to foretell how the country should be divided. By this method,
                           he precluded every pretence of discontent among the tribes. Each of them drew a ticket, on which a certain portion of land
                           was described; or perhaps in one urn the names of the tribes, and in another the lands were specified, (Calmet) and the tickets
                           were drawn by two persons of irreproachable character, probably by Eleazar and Josue. (Haydock) (Numbers xxvi. 54.) --- Only

                           all the forces, as it is mentioned by anticipation, chap. x. 28. But there seems to be no need of this, as Caleb might attack
                           them a second time with his own family and the assistance of the tribe of Juda, after they had seized those places again,
                           while Josue was in the north. Hebron was granted to him without drawing lots. When he was besieging Cariath Sepher, he promised
                           his daughter to the person who should first enter; and Othoniel, his brother, or nephew, obtained her in marriage, chap. xv.
