                           In this instance we see how unfounded are the judgments of men. As if the misfortune itself were not sufficient to endure,

                           of the soldier who was to guard him. In most Greek copies we read: <I>the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain

                           terminates the history of St. Paul, as contained in the Acts of the Apostles. The other actions of this great apostle, for
                           want of being recorded, are involved in much obscurity. That he obtained his liberty again, and made many voyages to carry
                           the light of the gospel into many countries, is certain: but nothing is known as to the manner or time. He finished his labours
                           by martyrdom, being beheaded at Rome in the 66th of the Christian æra [the year A.D. 66], and the 13th of Nero. What a degree
                           of virtue might we not attain, were we animated by the spirit and courage of a St. Paul. Let us at least try to imitate his
                           example; and, if in dangers and difficulties we cannot clothe our souls in adamant, as he did, we may certainly avoid yielding
                           ingloriously to every light impression. Let us at an humble distance tread in his footsteps and live so that we may navigate
                           in safety the boisterous ocean of life, and by the grace of Jesus Christ arrive at the port, where danger is no more to be
                           apprehended. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lv. in Act. ad finem.[at the end.])</FONT></P></FONT><FONT size=2 face=Arial></FONT>

                                    their minds, they said he was a god.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever, and
                                    of a bloody flux. To whom Paul entered in: and when he had prayed, and laid his hands on him, he healed him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Which being done, all that had diseases in the island came, and were
                                    healed:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 Who also honoured us with many honours, and when we were&nbsp;setting

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 *And after three months, we sailed in a ship of Alexandria, that had

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 From thence coasting, we came to Rhegium: and after one day, the south

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 Where finding brethren, we were invited to stay with them seven days:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And from thence, when the brethren had heard of us, they came to meet
                                    us as far as Appii-forum and the Three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he gave thanks to God, and took courage.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And when we were come to Rome, Paul was permitted to dwell by himself,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And after the third day, he called together the chief of the Jews.
                                    And when they were assembled, he said to them: Men, brethren, I, having done nothing against the people, or the custom of
                                    our fathers, was delivered up a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Who when they had examined me, would have let me go, for that there
                                    was no cause of death in me:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 But the Jews opposing it, I was forced to appeal to Cæsar, not that
                                    I had any thing to accuse my nation of.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 For this cause, therefore, I desired to see you, and to speak to you.
                                    Because that for the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 But they said to him: We neither received letters concerning thee
                                    from Judea, neither did any of the brethren that came hither, relate or speak any evil of thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 But we desire to hear from thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning
                                    this sect, we know that it is every where gainsayed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came very many to him
                                    to his lodgings; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, out of the law
                                    of Moses and the prophets, from morning till evening.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And some believed the things that were said: but some believed not.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 *Saying: Go to this people, and say to them: With the ear you shall

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 For the heart of this people is grown gross, and with their ears have

                                    and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 Be it known, therefore, to you, that this salvation of God is sent
