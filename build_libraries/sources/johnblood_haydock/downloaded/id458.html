                           seems, however, to connect the burning of some with the destruction of many more, who had eaten the quails, as if both judgments
                           took place at the same encampment. Septuagint render the Hebrew, "and a mixt rabble among them, desired greatly; and sitting,

                           of this wicked world. (Challoner) --- This verse may relate a different history from the preceding ones, as the punishment
                           was of another kind. (Du Hamel) --- The murmurers were burnt to death. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           The Nile abounds in fish, which they might catch freely. The fish of the lake M&#339;ris, brought a considerable revenue to
                           the king of Egypt. (Herodotus, ii. 149.) The Hebrews had dwelt also near the Mediterranean Sea. Fish was formerly in greater
                           esteem than it is at present. The priests of Egypt abstained from it, (Herodotus, ii. 37,) and the people from such as had
                           scales, and from eels, because they believed they were sacred. (Herodotus, ii. 72). Porphyrius and Ovid even maintain that
                           they refrained from all fish, as well as the Syrians. But they had not probably carried their superstition so far, in the
                           days of Moses. --- <I>Garlic.</I> These things are much more delicious and wholesome in hot countries. The Greeks fed much
                           on cucumbers and garlic. (Aristophanes) --- The Turks still delight in them, eating the former raw with sour milk, (which
                           would be very dangerous in our climate), and onions, which are as good as our pears. (Spon. Bellon. iii. 18, &amp;c.) The
                           wounded Machaon feasts upon onions, &amp;c. (Homer, Iliad ix.) The Egyptians afterwards scrupled to eat leeks and onions.

                           Sat. xv.) But in the earlier ages Moses represents them as accustomed to such food. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           (Calmet) --- Moses fears the anger of God falling upon the people. (Haydock) --- It is very wonderful that the Hebrew text

                           woman; and this absurd peculiarity is more absurdly accounted for, by saying that Moses was "so exasperated during this his
                           address to the divine Being, as to be incapable of pronouncing both syllables!" The same mistake occurs [in] 1 Kings xxiv.

                           senators or counselors. (Challoner) --- Calmet calls this in question. (Dissert. on the Police, &amp;c.) Moses chose these
                           senators from among the officers, whom he had before set over the people, (Exodus xviii.) or from those who had superintended
                           their affairs in Egypt, according to the Rabbins, (Exodus iii. 14,) who say that the traditions explaining the law were entrusted
                           to them. (Jarchi, &amp;c.) --- <I>Ancients;</I> a title of authority in the East. See Genesis l. 7. It was not so necessary

                           received a great increase, when they were filled with the spirit of God. (Calmet) --- They were thus authorized to decide

                           of God, so that these ancients received what was sufficient for them, while Moses suffered no diminution. Thus one lamp communicates
                           light to another, without being impaired. (Origen, hom. vi.) Theodoret (q. 18,) also adds, that a person confers baptism on
                           thousands, and yet loses no part of the grace himself. Selden (Syn. ii. 4,) shews that the Jews explain this spirit of a certain
                           emanation of divine light, or inspiration, which causes the prophets to speak. They have not in general, a distinct belief

                           there must have been sufficient quails for one hundred days. But Moses tells us that each one collected at least ten times
