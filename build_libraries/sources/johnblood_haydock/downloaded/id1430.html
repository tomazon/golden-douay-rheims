                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 Then Machabeus himself first taking his arms, exhorted the rest to
                                    expose themselves together with him, to the danger, and to succour their brethren.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And when they were going forth together with a willing mind, there
                                    appeared at Jerusalem a horseman going before them in white clothing, with golden armour, shaking a spear.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Then they all together blessed the merciful Lord, and took great courage:
                                    being ready to break through not only men, but also the fiercest beasts, and walls of iron.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 So they went on courageously, having a helper from heaven, and the
                                    Lord, who shewed mercy to them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And rushing violently upon the enemy, like lions, they slew of them
                                    eleven thousand footmen, and one thousand six hundred horsemen:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And put all the rest to flight; many of them being wounded, escaped
                                    naked: Yea, and Lysias himself fled away shamefully, and escaped.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And as he was a man of understanding, considering with himself, the
                                    loss he had suffered, and perceiving that the Hebrews could not be overcome, because they relied upon the help of the Almighty
                                    God, he sent to them:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And promised that he would agree to all things that are just, and
                                    that he would persuade the king to be their friend.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Then Machabeus consented to the request of Lysias, providing for the
                                    common good in all things; and whatsoever Machabeus wrote to Lysias, concerning the Jews, the king allowed of.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 For there were letters written to the Jews from Lysias, to this effect:

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 John, and Abesalom, who were sent from you, delivering your writings,
                                    requested that I would accomplish those things which were signified by them.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Therefore whatsoever things could be reported to the king, I have
                                    represented to him: and he hath granted as much as the matter permitted.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And we have heard that the Jews would not consent to my father to

                                    to allow them to live after their own laws.</font></p>

                                    we have ordained and decreed, that the temple should be restored to them, and that they may live according to the custom of
                                    their ancestors.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 Thou shalt do well, therefore, to send to them, and grant them peace,
