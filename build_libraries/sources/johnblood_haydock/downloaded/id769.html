                           <i>For them that shall be changed,</i> i.e., For souls happily changed, by being converted to God; (Challoner) or it may allude
                           to the variety of speakers here introduced. (Berthier) --- Protestants leave <i>shoshannim,</i> which some translate, "on
                           the lilies," (Aquila; St. Jerome) or "instrument of six strings." (Calmet) --- <i>The beloved,</i> viz., our Lord Jesus Christ.
                           (Challoner) --- Hebrew, "of loves;" or of the young women, friends of the bride, (<i>yedidoth</i>) who sung the Epithalamium,
                           as we see in the 18th Idyl of Theocritus. The Jews formerly explained this psalm of the Messias, as well as all the Fathers
                           after the apostles, Hebrew, i. 8. Many passages cannot refer to Solomon's marriage with the daughter of Pharao, though some
                           might be referred to that event, as a figure of Christ's union with his Church. (Calmet) --- The whole had better be understood
                           of Christ, (Berthier) being intended for the instruction of all converts from paganism and schism. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           invoking the muses. (St. Jerome) --- <i>Swiftly.</i> I have not to meditate. (Calmet) --- The Holy Ghost moves my tongue,
                           (2 Peter i. 21.) as fast as my hands can write, Jeremias xxxvi. 18., and 4 Esdras xiv. 39. (Haydock) --- High mysteries, in
                           honour of the great king, occupy my thoughts, and to him I refer this canticle. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           of his word. (St. Jerome) --- The young women here address the spouse. --- <i>Therefore,</i> I say, (Rabbins) or "because"
                           God hath chosen thee freely. Solomon was styled the beloved, (2 Kings xii. 25.) and was highly favoured, Wisdom viii. 20.,
                           and 3 Kings iv. 29., &amp;c. But this was only a figure of Jesus Christ, (Calmet) whose hypostatical union was an effect of
                           gratuitous predestination, (St. Augustine, præd. xv.) though his other graces were merited. (St. Chrysostom) (Sa) (Calmet)

                           but he only wanted enemies to be so. The sword of Christ is his word, (Hebrews iv. 12.) anger, (Apocalypse xix. 15.; Calmet)
                           or human nature. (St. Jerome) --- Some translate, "and ride," because kings were mounted on chariots, and governed their people
                           with the reins of justice, &amp;c. (Robertson) --- <i>Justice.</i> These titles are eagerly desired by monarchs; as martial
                           prowess, clemency, and justice, (Calmet) render them objects of terror, and of love. (Haydock) --- Christ conquered by his
                           miracles, mildness, &amp;c., (Calmet) propagating the truth, and punishing the rebellious. (Worthington) (Psalm ii. 8.)</font></p><b>

                           clear, that the Messias is here styled God, (Hebrews i. 8.) though some of the Jews would evade this proof by saying, "God
                           is thy throne," 1 Paralipomenon xxix. 23. Even Munster translates, <i>O Deus,</i> and the Jew Agesila, <i><u>o Thee</u>.</i>
                           Elohim is never addressed to any one by the prophets, but to the true God, (Berthier) and this title alludes to the judicial
                           character of Christ, (Acts x. 42.; Calmet) of whose kingdom there shall be no end, Luke i. 33. --- Calvin is very bold in
                           asserting, that David spoke properly of Solomon, as if the apostle had applied the text to our Saviour only in the mystical
                           sense; whereas many things cannot belong to the former, and the Chaldean and Fathers expound this psalm of Christ and his
                           Church. --- Solomon did not persevere in wisdom, and his beauty was equalled by that of Absalom, &amp;c. (Worthington) ---
                           Crellius and Grotius in vain attempted to weaken this proof of Christ's divinity, as a Jew, who disputed with Origen, did.

                           verb, as being spoken of the Deity. (St. Irenæus iii. 6.) (Bossuet) (Du Hamel) --- "O Elohim, thy Elohim," (Haydock) which
                           implies more than one person in God. (Berthier) --- Many king might be preferred to Solomon; but Christ was raised above all.
                           (Worthington) --- <i>Fellows.</i> In consequence of the free gift of God, in uniting the human nature to the second person,
                           the Messias advanced in glory; (Haydock) or rather the prophet speaks of his subsequent merits, which entitled him to the
                           greatest felicity. --- <i>The oil of gladness,</i> alludes to the reward of his labours. <i><u>Dia touto</u></i> seems to
                           require this sense, though the Hebrew may be rendered, "because." (Berthier) --- Either the cause or the effect may be meant.
                           (Menochius) --- Solomon was chosen before many of his elder brothers; but Christ was anointed by the Holy Ghost, Acts x. 38.

                           in chests of ivory, with odoriferous herbs. (Haydock) --- The ancients admired such garments, Genesis xxvii. 27., and Amos
                           iii. 15. --- They had been given, together with the ivory boxes, as a present to Solomon at his marriage, and might give him

                                    <P>My tongue <I>is </I>the pen of a scrivener that writeth swiftly.</P>
