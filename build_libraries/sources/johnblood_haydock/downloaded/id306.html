                           bound him for a thousand years.</I> I shall give the reader an abridgment of what St. Augustine has left us on this chapter,
                           in his 20th book de Civ. Dei[City of God]. From the 5th to the 16th chap., (t. vii. p. 578 et seq.) he treats upon these difficulties:
                           What is meant by the first and second resurrection; by the binding and chaining up of the devil; by the thousand years that
                           the saints reign with Christ; by the first and second death; by Gog and Magog, &amp;c. As to the <I>first resurrection,</I>
                           chap. vi., he takes notice on the 5th verse, that <I>resurrection</I>[1] in the Gospels, and in St. Paul, is applied not only
                           to the body but also to the soul; and the <I>second resurrection,</I> which is to come, is that of the bodies: that there
                           is also a <I>death of the soul,</I> which is by sin; and that the <I>second death</I> is that of soul and body by eternal
                           damnation: that both bad and good shall rise again in their bodies. On those words, (ver. 6) <I>Blessed is he that hath part
                           in the first resurrection; in these the second death hath no power.</I> Such, saith he, (chap. ix.) as have risen from sin,
                           and have remained in that resurrection of the soul, shall never be liable to the second death, which is damnation. Cap. vii.
                           p. 580, he says that <I>some Catholics not understanding rightly the first resurrection,</I> have been led into <I>ridiculous
                           fables,</I>[2]<I> </I>and this by the interpretation which they put on the <I>thousand years;</I> as if the first resurrection
                           implied <I>a resurrection of the bodies</I> of the martyrs and saints, who should live <I>on the earth with Christ</I> for
                           a thousand years before the general resurrection, in all <I>manner of delights.</I> This was the opinion of those called Millenarians:
                           this, saith he, might seem <I>tolerable in some measure,</I>[3] if taken for spiritual delights, (for we ourselves were once
                           in these sentiments) but if for carnal pleasures, it can only be <I>believed by carnal men</I>. He then expounds what may
                           be understood by the <I>binding</I> and chaining of the devil for a thousand years; (Cap. vii. &amp; viii, p. 581) that the
                           thousand years, meaning a long time, may signify all the time from Christ's first coming[4] to his second at the end of the
                           world, and to the last short persecution under antichrist. The devil is said to be <I>bound,</I> that is, his power much <I>lessened</I>
                           and restrained, in comparison of the great and extensive power he had over all nations before Christ's incarnation; not but
                           that he still tempts many,[5] and raiseth persecutions, which always turn to their greater good; and that towards the end
                           of the world he shall be let loose, as it were, for a short time, and permitted with his infernal spirits to exercise his
                           malice against mankind, to try the patience of the elect, and to shew the power of God's grace, by which his faithful servants
                           shall triumph over the devil. (N. B.[<EM>Nota Bene,</EM> Note Well?])&nbsp;What St. Augustine adds divers times in these chapters:
                           "Let no one," says he, "imagine[6] that even during that short time, there shall be no Church of Christ on the earth: God
                           forbid: even when the devil shall be let loose, he shall not be able to seduce the Church." Cap. ix, p. 586, he expounds those
                           words, (ver. 4-5) <I>I saw the souls of them that were beheaded....and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years....This
                           is the first resurrection:</I> i.e. the first resurrection is while the devil is chained up for the space of a thousand years.
                           He takes notice that the <I>present state of the Church</I> is many times called <I>the kingdom of God,</I> and that the <I>Church
                           of Christ reigns now with Christ,</I> both in the living saints and in those who are dead, in the souls of the martyrs, and
                           of others, who having lived and died piously, now reign with Christ, not yet <I>in their bodies,</I>[7] <I>but their souls
                           reign with him.</I> On those words of the 4th verse: <I>who had not adored the beast, nor his image, nor received his mark,</I>
                           he only gives this exposition, as agreeable to the Christian faith, that by the <I>beast</I> may be understood the multitude
                           of wicked sinners in general, and the <I>image of the beast</I>[8] those who are of the Church in outward appearance and profession
                           only, and not by their works. When it is said (ver. 5) that the <I>rest of the dead lived not till the thousand years were
                           finished:</I> they lived not, says he, as to their souls, when they should have lived; and therefore not being happy in heaven,
                           when their <I>bodies shall rise, it shall not be to life, but to judgment and damnation, which is the second death</I>. Cap.
                           xi, he expounds the 7th and 8th verses, where it is said that <I>Satan shall be loosed....and seduce the nations which are
                           over the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog,</I>[9]<I> and shall gather them together to battle</I>. This, says St.
                           Augustine, will be <I>the last persecution</I> at the approach of the day of judgment, which the whole city, or the whole
                           Church of Christ dispersed through the universe, will suffer from the whole city of the devil. Neither need Gog and Magog
                           be taken for a particular[10] barbarous people, but such as are dispersed in a manner in every nation, and who shall then
                           break out by the instigation of Satan into an open hatred and persecution against the faithful servants of God; as it is said,
                           (ver. 8.) <I>they ascended upon the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints,</I> where we cannot literally
                           understand one camp, one city, or one place, but the Church every where dispersed. Cap. xii, he expounds the 9th verse, where
                           he takes <I>fire</I> to signify, metaphorically, <I>the firm resistance</I> and constancy of the good, and the <I>fire</I>[11]
                           of their zeal, which devoured as it were the wicked; or we may understand with others, the temporal <I>fire</I> of God's judgments
                           in this world against the wicked, but not the last eternal fire; because the eternal fire comes <I>not down from heaven</I>
                           but the wicked are cast into it below. Cap. xiii, he teacheth that the last persecution[12] of antichrist, here mentioned,
                           shall&nbsp; last but three years and six months; i.e. a little while. Cap. xiv and xv, he expounds the 10th and following
                           verse, of the devil being cast into the lake of fire, after the last persecution of antichrist. By <I>the beast</I> he understands,
                           as before, the city or multitude of all the wicked; and by the <I>false prophet,</I> either antichrist or the outward appearance
                           of faith in them that have none. Then follows the last judgment, where it is said that <I>the books are opened,</I> and also
                           that <I>another book was opened.</I> By the first book, may be understood men and their consciences; and by the <I>other book,
                           the book of life,</I> that[13] <I>of eternal predestination.</I> Thus far S. Augustine, where we see that he delivers the
                           common Catholic doctrine, that by the thousand years, so often mentioned in this chapter, he understands all that time in
                           which the souls of the martyrs, and of all other saints, reign happy with Christ in heaven, till after the general resurrection
                           they receive a full and complete happiness, both as to soul and body. A false exposition of these <I>thousand years</I> gave
                           occasion to the mistake, the error, and heresy of those called the Millenarians, which Mede and Dr. W. have followed. Papias,
                           who lived soon after, or perhaps with St. John, was the chief promoter of this mistake; a man, says Eusebius, of "little judgment
                           and capacity,"[14] who misconstrued the discourses which he heard. He was followed by divers writers in the second, third,
                           and fourth century, who did not hold with Cerinthus and his followers, that the saints should rise before the general resurrection,
                           and reign with Christ on earth for a thousand years in all manner of <I>sensual pleasures;</I> but in <I>spiritual delights,</I>
                           in the city of Jerusalem, built anew after that glorious manner described in the next chapter. Now though this opinion had
                           several considerable abettors, of which I find these seven: Papias, St. Justin[St. Justin&nbsp;Martyr], St. Irenæus, Tertullian,
                           Nepos, (a bishop, in Egypt; in Eusebius, lib. vii. chap. xxiv.) Victorinus Petabionensis, Lactantius, and Severus Sulpitius:
                           yet were there always other learned Catholic writers who rejected it as a fable. Of this number was Caius, a priest, at Rome,
                           about the end of the second age[century]; Origen, in his prologue on the Canticles; St. Denys, of Alexandria, who in the third
                           age[century] wrote to confute Nepos; (see Eusebius, lib. vii. History of the Church, chap. xxiv., who treats it as <I>a fable
                           </I>) St. </FONT><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">Basil,[15] who calls it an <I>old wife's tale,</I> and a
                           Jewish fiction, Epist. 293; St. Gregory of Nazianzus, Orat. 52; St. Epiphanius, St. Jerome, Philastrius, Theodoret, who place
                           this opinion among the heresies and heretical fables: so that this could never be looked upon as the constant doctrine and
                           tradition of the Church. The bishop of Meaux[Bossuet] takes notice, that Mede either mistook or falsified the text of St.
                           Justin,[16] who, in his Dialogue with Tryphon, holds that opinion of a <I>thousand years reign;</I> but adds, "I also told
                           you, that many who are Christians of pious and sound sentiments, do not own this to be true." Thus we read in the Greek, as
                           well as in the Latin translation: but Mr. Mede quite changes the sense, by adding a negative in this manner; <I>but many who
                           are <B>not</B> of this pure and holy doctrine,</I> &amp;c. We may observe that St. Justin&nbsp;says in the next page, that
                           they who own not the resurrection of the body, and say that souls go to heaven without any future resurrection, are not to
                           be accounted Christians, but are to be looked upon as Sadducees and unbelievers. Which is very true. And he adds, that he,
                           and others who <I>think right</I> with him, know that there will be a resurrection of the flesh, and a rebuilding of Jerusalem
                           for a thousand years, which St. Justin himself judged grounded on the prophets, Isaias, Ezechiel, &amp;c. So that not to make
                           St. Justin contradict himself, he mentions three opinions: the first is the heresy of those who absolutely denied the future
                           resurrection of the dead: these were not Christians, but unbelievers, Sadducees, &amp;c. The second was of those who held
                           that the martyrs and saints should rise, and reign for a thousand years in their bodies on the earth; this, which was his
                           own opinion, he calls <I>the right and true doctrine.</I> But thirdly, he does not condemn those pious Christians who, as
                           he had said before, disowned this thousand years reign, for this would be to contradict himself. (Witham) --- In the above
                           chapter, what man can reflect without trembling, that the devil has the rage of a dragon, the cunning of an old serpent, the
                           malice of a calumniator, and that he is a most implacable enemy? On the other hand, what man is there that does not feel consolation
                           in the reflection, that Jesus Christ has vanquished this savage fiend, and bound him in fetters, by limiting the exercise
                           of his rage and malice? Some understand this chaining of the dragon of the reign of Constantine, and particularly after the
                           defeat of Licinius; (see above, [Apocalypse] chap. xii. 18.) and the thousand years of the intermediate period between Constantine
                           and antichrist, when the devil will again be let loose, but for a short time, only three years and a half. (Bible de Vence)
                           --- <I>Bound him,</I> &amp;c. The power of Satan has been very much abridged by the passion of Christ; for a thousand years;
                           that is for the whole time of the new testament, but especially from the time of the destruction of Babylon or pagan Rome,
                           till the new efforts of Gog and Magog against the Church, towards the end of the world. During which time the souls of the
                           martyrs and saints live and reign with Christ in heaven, in the first resurrection, which is that of the soul to the life
                           of glory, as the second resurrection will be that of the body, at the day of&nbsp;general judgment. (Challoner) </FONT></P>
