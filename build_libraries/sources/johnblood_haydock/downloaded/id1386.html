                           <i>Take.</i> Before (chap. iii. 17.) God made the choice, (Calmet) as he does here, ver. 7. He confirms the authority of those
                           who are appointed to govern. --- <i>Meanest.</i> Literally, "last," (Haydock) which seems to denote such as are chosen without
                           regard to their dignity or obscurity in life, Genesis xlvii. 2., and 3 Kings xii. 31. (Calmet) --- Pastors are not excused
                           from admonishing the people for fear of danger or despair of reclaiming them, as each one is bound to do his duty. (St. Jerome)

                           proves faithless and silent, as in this instance. (Haydock) --- The people were persuaded that none suffered except for some
                           fault, ver. 10.; Jeremias xxxi. 30., Daniel xiii. 52., and Genesis xliv. 16. The author of the Book of Job takes great pains
                           to remove this mistake. God sometimes sends crosses for a trial, (Calmet) and to increase the merit of his servants; though
                           it be very true, (Haydock) "no one is miserable except he deserve it." (St. Augustine)</font></p><b>

                           will to save all. He knocks at the door of our heart, (Apocalypse iii. 20.) and if man do what depends on him, nothing will
                           be wanting on the part of God. (St. Thomas Aquinas, [Summa Theologiae] i. 2. q. 109. and 112.) (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           before. Some think (Calmet) that the messenger came also to announce what happened after the death of Godolias. (Sanctius)
                           --- <i>Captivity.</i> Here it is evident that the prophet dates from that event, chap. i., &amp;c. (Haydock) --- As he prophesied
