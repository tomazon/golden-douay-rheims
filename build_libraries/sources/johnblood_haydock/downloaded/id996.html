                           <i>Asor Haddan</i> sent a priest to instruct these people, but Salmanasar had transported them into the country. (Calmet)
                           --- They continued for some time worshipping idols alone, and afterwards they consented to pay the like adoration to the Lord,
                           4 Kings xvii. 24, &amp;c. (Haydock) --- It is clear, from their petition, that they had as yet no temple. The first was erected
                           by them on Garizim, by leave of Alexander the Great, as a retreat for Manasses, brother of the Jewish high priest, and others
                           who would not be separated from their strange wives. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xi.) --- Yet the Samaritan Chronicle, lately
                           published, seems to give a higher antiquity to that temple, and pretends that a miracle declared in favour of the place. (Calmet)
                           --- The fathers indeed adored there, (John iv. 20., and Genesis xii. 6,) and Josue erected an altar on Hebal, but the Samaritan
                           copy says it was to be on Garizim, Deuteronomy xxvii. 4., and Josue viii. 30. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>You,</i> &amp;c. Literally, "It is not for you and us to build." But why might not these people assist in the work, as
                           well as king Hiram or Darius? (Haydock) --- Schismatics and heretics must not communicate in sacrifices with Catholics, (Worthington)
                           nor must the latter have society with them, in matters of religion. The Jews feared lest the Samaritans might introduce the
                           worship of idols, or claim a part of the temple, or at least boast of what they had done. (Tirinus) --- They were aware of
                           the insincerity of these people. (Menochius) --- The permission was moreover only granted to the Jews: (Calmet) but Cyrus
                           had exhorted all to contribute; (chap. i. 4,) and Darius, as well as his pagan governors, were not repelled with disdain,
                           chap. vi. 13. This treatment caused the Samaritans to be more inveterate, though the Jews were always more unwilling to come
                           to a reconciliation. (Haydock) --- "For the Scripture did not say, the Samaritans have no commerce with the Jews," says St.
                           Chrysostom in John iv. The Jewish authors inform us, that "Ezra, &amp;c., gathered all the congregation into the temple, and
                           the Levites sung and cursed the Samaritans,...that no Israelite eat of any thing that is a Samaritan's, nor that any Samaritan
                           be proselyted to Israel, nor have any part in the resurrection," &amp;c. (R. Tanchum) (Lightfoot i. p. 598.) (Kennicott) ---
                           If this were true, it would be carrying their resentment too far; as we ought to promote the conversion of the greatest reprobates.
                           But we have no reason to condemn such great men. They knew the character of the Samaritans, and wished to bring them to a
                           sense of their duty, by this rebuke. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           fed from his table. Salt is put for all their emoluments; (Calmet) and hence the word <i>salary</i> is derived. (Pliny, [Natural
