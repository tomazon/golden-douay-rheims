                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">7 Now when Apollonius had given the king notice concerning the money that
                                    he was told of, he called for Heliodorus, who had the charge over his affairs, and sent him with commission to bring him the
                                    foresaid money.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">8 So Heliodorus forthwith began his journey, under a colour of visiting
                                    the cities of Celosyria and Phenicia, but indeed to fulfill the king's purpose.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">9 And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteously received
                                    in the city by the high priest, he told him what information had been given concerning the money: and declared the cause for
                                    which he was come: and asked if these things were so indeed.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">10 Then the high priest told him that these were sums deposited, and provisions
                                    for the subsistence of the widows and the fatherless:</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">11 And that some part of that which wicked Simon had given intelligence
                                    of, belonged to Hircanus, <I>son </I>of Tobias, a man of great dignity; and that the whole was four hundred talents of silver,
                                    and two hundred of gold:</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">12 But that to deceive them who had trusted to the place and temple which
                                    is honoured throughout the whole world, for the reverence and holiness of it, was a thing which could not by any means be
                                    done.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">13 But he, by reason of the orders he had received from the king, said,
                                    that by all means the money must be carried to the king.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">14 So on the day he had appointed, Heliodorus entered in to order this
                                    matter. But there was no small terror throughout the whole city.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">15 And the priests prostrated themselves before the altar in their priests'
                                    vestments, and called upon him from heaven, who made the law concerning things given to be kept, that he would preserve them
                                    safe, for them that had deposited them.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">16 Now whosoever saw the countenance of the high priest, was wounded in
                                    heart: for his face, and the changing of his colour, declared the inward sorrow of his mind.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">17 For the man was so compassed with sadness and horror of the body, that
                                    it was manifest to them that beheld him, what sorrow he had in his heart.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">18 Others also came flocking together out of their houses, praying and

                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">19 And the women, girded with haircloth about their breasts, came together
                                    in the streets. And the virgins also that were shut up, came forth, some to Onias, and some to the walls, and others looked
                                    out of the windows.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">20 And all holding up their hands towards heaven, made supplication.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">21 For the expectation of the mixt multitude, and of the high priest, who

                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">22 And these indeed called upon almighty God, to preserve the things that

                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">23 But Heliodorus executed that which he had resolved on, himself being

                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">24 But the spirit of the Almighty God gave a great evidence of his presence,
                                    so that all that had presumed to obey him, falling down by the power of God, were struck with fainting and dread.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">25 For there appeared to them a horse, with a terrible rider upon him,
                                    adorned with a very rich covering: and he ran fiercely and struck Heliodorus with his fore-feet, and he that sat upon him
                                    seemed to have armour of gold.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">26 Moreover there appeared two other young men, beautiful and strong, bright
                                    and glorious, and in comely apparel: who stood by him, on either side, and scourged him without ceasing with many stripes.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">27 And Heliodorus suddenly fell to the ground, and they took him up, covered
                                    with great darkness, and having put him into a litter they carried him out.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">28 So he that came with many servants, and all his guard, into the aforesaid
                                    treasury, was carried out, no one being able to help him, the manifest power of God being known.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">29 And he indeed, by the power of God, lay speechless, and without all
                                    hope of recovery.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">30 But they praised the Lord because he had glorified his place: and the
                                    temple, that a little before was full of fear and trouble, when the Almighty Lord appeared, was filled with joy and gladness.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">31 Then some of the friends of Heliodorus forthwith begged of Onias, that
                                    he would call upon the Most High to grant him his life, who was ready to give up the ghost.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">32 So the high priest, considering that the king might perhaps suspect
                                    that some mischief had been done to Heliodorus by the Jews, offered a sacrifice of health for the recovery of the man.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">33 And when the high priest was praying, the same young men in the same
                                    clothing stood by Heliodorus, and said to him: Give thanks to Onias the priest: because for his sake the Lord hath granted
                                    thee life.</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">34 And thou having been scourged by God, declare unto all men the great

                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">35 So Heliodorus, after he had offered a sacrifice to God, and made great
                                    vows to him, that had granted him life, and given thanks to Onias, taking his troops with him, returned to the king. </FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">36 And he testified to all men the works of the great God, which he had

                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">37 And when the king asked Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to be sent
                                    yet once more to Jerusalem, he said:</FONT></P>
                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">38 If thou hast any enemy or traitor to thy kingdom, send him thither,

                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">39 For he that hath his dwelling in the heavens, is the visitor and protector

                                    <P><FONT size=3 face="Times New Roman,Times,serif">40 And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of the treasury,
