                           The leper was not left to his own judgment to mix with society, as soon as he perceived himself cleansed. He had to send for
                           a priest; and one of the most discerning among those who made it their employment to study in the court of the tabernacle,
                           was commissioned to examine him. (Grotius) --- The sacrifice was offered without the camp, (Calmet) if it may be called a
                           sacrifice. (Menochius) --- That of Christ's body was not yet instituted, which supplies all the rest. (St. Augustine, contra
                           adv. i. 19.) (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           wet, as it as to fly away. (Calmet) --- The cedar prevents putrefaction, the hyssop is very odoriferous, the scarlet and the

                           accustomed to set birds at liberty in honour of their gods. Demosthenes accuses Conon of having eaten those which had been
                           used in his purification. Bonfrere believes that Moses does not here prescribe any sacrifice. Why then is a priest employed

                           even to the <I>feet,</I> Isaias vii. 20. (Haydock) --- Probably with a pair of scissors. (Calmet) --- The Egyptians priests
                           did so every third day, that nothing impure might be concealed. (Herod., ii. 37.) The greatest caution was requisite to prevent
                           the return of the leprosy; and therefore, after the first purification, (ver. 4,) the leper is not allowed to go home, till
                           a sufficient time has elapsed to ascertain whether he be radically healed, and then he must offer a sacrifice, ver. 10. (Haydock)
                           --- But why so many prescriptions for a disease so involuntary, (Calmet) which must have already caused the unhappy sufferer
                           so much pain? (Haydock) --- The Rabbins assert, that the leprosy was sent to punish some secret transgression, particularly
                           some pride or detraction; as they maintain, that every illness is in punishment of some offence. (Abarbanel.) (Grotius) ---
                           If [It?] was often the effect of intemperance or negligence; and the sacrifices were exacted, to make some reparation to God
                           for remaining in the camp and near the tabernacle, at the commencement of the disorder. (Calmet) --- This foul cutaneous disease
                           was also very infectious, and the law was designed to impress people with a horror of it, and to teach them to prevent its
                           ravages as much as possible. (Haydock) --- A sparrow is slain, and the hair shaved, to indicate that all sinful affections
                           must be cut off by the true penitent, while the sparrow, which is sent away into the desert, reminds him that he must live
                           a stranger to pleasure, and perfectly mortified. (Du Hamel) --- <I>Days;</I> without having any communication with his wife.
