                           accustomed to make this reply as often as this epistle was read. When we recall to our mind the excess of corruption that
                           had reigned in the city of Corinth under paganism, excess attested by profane authors, and which St. Paul brings to their
                           recollection, (1 Corinthians vi. 9.) we are all astonishment that in the short space of four years the gospel had operated
                           amongst the faithful of this church, such a prodigious change in their manners, and that they were become capable of receiving
