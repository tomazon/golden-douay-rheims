                           Mention is made in the gospels, of a woman who was a sinner, (Luke vii.) of Mary of Bethania, the sister of Lazarus, (John
                           xi. and xii; Mark xiv; Matthew xxvi.) and of Mary Magdalene, who followed Jesus from Galilee, and ministered to him. Many
                           think all this to belong to one and the same person: others think these were three distinct persons. See the arguments on
                           both sides in Alban Butler's Lives of the Saints, July 22d; and also more at large in the dissertations upon the three Marys,

                           --- The Greek word is <i><u>epitropou</u>.</i> It was the custom of the Jews, says St. Jerome, that pious women should minister
                           of their substance, meat, drink, and clothing, to their teachers going about with them. But as this might have given cause
                           of scandal among the Gentiles, St. Paul mentions that he allowed it not. (1 Corinthians ix. 5. 12.) They thus ministered to
                           our Lord and his apostles of their worldly substance, from whom they received spiritual riches.</font></p><b>

                           This is not a voluntary confession, which merits a reward, but a forced acknowledgment, extorted against their wills. Like
                           fugitive servants, who, when they meet their masters, think of nothing but of deprecating punishment. The devils think our
                           Lord is come down upon earth to judge them. (St. Jerome) --- The torment from which this devil desires to be freed, is the
                           pain and affliction he would suffer by being forced to yield to the power of Christ, in leaving the man; not the general torment
                           of hell, to which he knew he was unchangeably and irrevocably condemned. He was also tormented with the fear, lest he should
                           be now consigned to those eternal pains before his time, as it is expressed in St. Matthew. For, though the evil spirits are
                           unavoidably condemned, and already suffer the chief torments of hell, yet the rigorous fulfilment of all is deferred to the
                           day of judgment. (Jansenius, conc. Evang.)</font></p><b>
