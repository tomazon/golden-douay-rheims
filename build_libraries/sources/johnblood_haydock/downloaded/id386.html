                           yet they could not take these away: God being pleased to abridge in this the power of Satan. So we see they could not afterwards

                           <i>Pharao hardened his own heart.</i> By this we see that Pharao was himself the efficient cause of his heart being hardened,
                           and not God. See the same repeated in ver. 32, <i>Pharao hardened his heart at this time also;</i> likewise chap. ix. 7, 35,
                           and chap. xiii. 15. (Challoner) --- This is the constant doctrine of the holy fathers, St. Augustine, ser. 88, de Temp. q.
                           18, 28, 36; St. Basil, orat., "that God is not the author of evil;" St. Chrysostom, hom. 67, in Jo.; &amp;c. Hence Origen,
                           periar. 3, says, "The Scripture sheweth manifestly that Pharao was hardened by his own will; for God said to him, <i>thou
                           wouldst not: if thou wilt not dismiss Israel</i>." Even the priests of the Philistines were so well convinced of this, that
                           they said, (1 Kings vi. 6,) <i>Why do you harden your hearts?</i> God therefore hardened them only by not absolutely hindering
                           their wickedness, and by punishing them with less severity, as they did not deserve to be corrected like dear children, Hebrews
                           xii. --- <i>Perdition is from thyself,</i> <font size="3">Osee xiii. 9. As cold naturally congeals water, so we of ourselves
                           run to evil. </font>Thus God <i>cast Pharao into the sea,</i> by permitting, not by forcing, him to enter, Exodus xv. 4. How
                           shocking must then the blasphemous doctrine of Zuinglius, (ser. de provid. 5,) Calvin, (Instit.&nbsp;8, 17,) &amp;c., appear,
                           who attribute every wicked deed to God, though they pretend at the same time that he is not unjust, even when he commands
                           and impels a man to commit murder or adultery.&nbsp;<i>Idem facinus puta adulterium...quantum Dei est auctoris, motoris, impulsoris
                           opus est, crimen non est; quantum hominis est, crimen ac scelus est.</i> (Zuinglius, sup.) The light of reason may suffice
                           to confute such absurdity. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           confess, that Moses is something more than themselves. (Calmet) --- Thus God interferes, whenever a contest of miracles, real
                           or apparent, might lead any sincere seeker astray. He caused the priests of Baal to be confounded; (3 Kings xix,) and Simon
                           Magus, flying in the air, was hurled down at the prayer of St. Peter. (Hegesip.) Cyrola, the Arian patriarch, attempting to
                           deceive the people, by giving sight to a man whom he bribed to feign himself blind; and Calvin, who wished to have the honour
                           of raising a man to life, at Geneva, by the like imposition, were both deservedly covered with confusion; while, of those
                           unhappy men who joined in the collusion, one lost his sight, and the other his life. (Gregory of Tours, ii. Hist. 3; Bolsec.)
                           On such occasions, we are admonished to be on our guard, and to adhere to the old religion. (Deuteronomy xiii.; Matthew xxiv.)

                           they derived from them. (Cicero, N. Deor. i.) They sometimes sacrificed animals; though, at first, "they offered only prayer
                           and incense." (Macrobius, Satur. i. 7; Genesis xliii. 16.) Their belief in the transmigration of souls, perhaps, induced them
