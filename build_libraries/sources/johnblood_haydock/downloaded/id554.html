                           Thus was verified the prediction of Jacob, that Simeon and Levi, who had been too much united for the destruction of Sichem,
                           should be scattered among their brethren, Genesis xxxiv., and xlix. 6. The tribe of Simeon was not very numerous, Numbers
                           xxvi. 14. Yet all his cities are not here enumerated, but only such as served to point out the limits. The Jews suppose that
                           this tribe occupied the cities of Juda only as long as the latter pleased, and that it was driven out of them in the days
                           of David, (1 Paralipomenon iv. 31.; Rabbins ap. Mas.) or at least under the reign of Ezechias, when it was forced to seek
                           fresh settlements in Gador and Seir, 1 Paralipomenon v. 39. It was, however, led into captivity by Salmanasar along with the
                           other nine tribes, in the sixth year of Ezechias, 4 Kings xvii. 6. The lot of Simeon was not in the centre of Juda, but only
                           within his limits, (Calmet) either on the south, (Cellarius) or on the west side, (Calmet) or on both. (Haydock) --- <I>And

                           so famous for the miracles of Elias, 3 Kings xviii. 20. Josephus (Jewish Wars ii. 17,) places it 120 stadia south of Ptolemais.
                           This range of mountains extended northward through the tribes of Issachar and of Zabulon. Pliny ([Natural History?] v. 17,)
                           speaks of a promontory and of a town of this name. Here also the god Carmel was adored, having an altar, but no temple or
                           image, as the ancients had decreed. <I>Nec simulacrum Deo aut templum, (sic tradidere majores) ara tantum et reverentia.</I>
                           (Tacitus, Hist. ii. 78.) --- Vespasian consulted the priest Basilides. Carmel means "the vineyard of the Lord," or the excellent
                           vineyard, &amp;c. It was so rich and beautiful as to become proverbial. The spouse compares the head of his beloved to Carmel,
                           chap. vii. 5. Isaias (xxxii. 15,) foretels that the deserts shall be equal to Carmel. It was covered with wood and fruit.
                           (St. Jerome in Isaias x. 18., and Jeremias iv. 26.) The city, which was built upon this mountain, and which Pliny calls by
                           the same name, was formerly styled Ecbatana. The oracle had denounced to Cambyses that he should die at Ecbatana, and he concluded
                           that the city of Media was meant; but it was "that of Syria," says Herodotus, (iii. 64,) where he died. --- <I>Labanath.</I>
                           Hebrew leaves out the conjunction. --- <I>Sihor</I> means a "troubled" river, (chap. xiii. 3,) or brook, which probably ran
                           near the white promontory mentioned by Pliny, (v. 19,) near Tyre. <I>Labanath</I> signifies "white."</FONT></P><B>

                           The Tyrian priests claim a very high antiquity; whereas Josephus (Antiquities viii. 2,) allows that the city was founded only
                           200 years after Josue, on which supposition this name must have been added by a subsequent writer. The matter, however, is
                           so uncertain, that nothing can be concluded. It was a colony of Sidon, Isaias xxiii. 12. Old Tyre was on the continent; the
                           new city was built in an island, where the temple of Jupiter Olympius formerly stood. Alexander made a road between the two
                           cities, when he besieged New Tyre: which, on that account, may be considered either as an island, or as part of the continent.
                           He used for this purpose the ruins of the old city, which he threw into the sea. Hiram had formed a similar road to the temple
                           of Jupiter. (Dius. ap. Josephus, contra Apion i.) Whether Nebuchodonosor besieged the Old or the New Tyre, soon after he had
                           taken Jerusalem, authors are not agreed. St. Jerome (in Ezechiel xxviii., and Amos i., &amp;c.) seems to think that he attacked
                           the new city; whereas Marsham believes that it was built only after the other had fallen a prey to the arms of the Chaldeans.
                           It was only five or 700 paces from the continent. <I>Tyrus quondam insula præalto mari septingentis passibus divisa, nunc
