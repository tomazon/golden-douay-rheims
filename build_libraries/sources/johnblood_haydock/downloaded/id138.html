                           shall strike thee, thou whited wall.</I>[1] These words are rather by way of a prophecy. (Witham) --- <I>Whited wall.</I>
                           That is, hypocrite, for pretending to judge me according to law; whereas, against all sense of justice, thou strikest me before
                           my condemnation; nay, even without giving me a hearing. The Fathers admire, on this occasion, the greatness of mind and freedom
                           St. Paul exhibited, in reproving the great. (Tirinus) --- This expression was not the angry words of an irritated man, nor
                           the effect of personal resentment, but the just freedom which insulted innocence may lawfully use in its own defence. (Haydock)
                           --- It was likewise a prophecy of what was going to happen. To those who do not consider it, it may seem a curse; but to others
                           a prophecy, as it really was. (St. Augustine, lib. i. cap. 19. de Verb. Dni.) --- For St. Chrysostom relates that the high
                           priest, being thunderstruck by this answer, became speechless and half deaf; so that not being able to reply a single word,
                           the bystanders did it for him. (Tirinus) --- It was also, as Ven. Bede says, to shew that the Jewish priesthood was to be
                           destroyed, as now the true priesthood of Christ was come and established. (Beda in hunc locum. [Ven. Bede on this place.])</FONT></P><B>

                           knew not,</I> &amp;c. Some think St. Paul here speaks ironically, or to signify that now he could be no longer high priest,
                           since the Mosaic law, with its rites and ceremonies, was abolished. But St. Chrysostom rather judges that St. Paul, having
                           been long absent from Jerusalem, might not know the person of the high priest, who was not now in the sanhedrim but in the
                           place whither the tribune had called the council, and who did not appear with that habit, and those marks which distinguished
                           him from others. (Witham) --- It seems rather surprising that St. Paul did not know that he was the high priest. The place
                           which he held in the council, one would suppose, would have been sufficient to have pointed him out. The apostle's absence
                           from Jerusalem is perhaps a sufficient reason to account for his not knowing this circumstance; especially, as the order of
                           succession to the priesthood was at that time much confused and irregular, determined by favour of the Roman emperor, or by
                           purchase. (Calmet) --- At all events, any difficulties we may now find in assigning a probable or true reason, are merely
                           negative arguments; and therefore too futile to be an impeachment of the apostle's veracity. (Haydock) --- St. Cyprian supposes
                           that St. Paul, considering the mere shadow of the name of priest, which Ananias then held, said: I knew not, brethren, that
                           he is high priest. (Ep. lxv. 69. nu. 2.) St. Chrysostom says, that the apostle here shews the wisdom of the serpent; but that
                           in his preaching, teaching, and patience, he used the simplicity of the dove.</FONT></P><B>

                           am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees.</I>[2] It may signify only a disciple of the Pharisees, though the common Greek copies
                           have <I>of a Pharisee.</I> (Witham) --- The address of the apostle in this is great. Knowing the different dispositions of
                           his judges, he throws disunion into their councils, in order to draw himself from danger. Such innocent artifices are allowed
                           in the defence of a just cause. It is one of our Saviour's counsels, to use the prudence of the serpent. St. Gregory, in his
                           Morality, (lib. xxxiv. cap. 3. and 4.) and St. Thomas Aquinas in his Sum. Theol. (2. 2. quæst. 37. art. 2.) observe, that
                           on similar occasions you may, without sin, cause divisions among the wicked; because their union being an evil, it is consequently
                           a good thing that the enemies of peace and righteousness should be divided in sentiments and interests. It must, however,
                           be acknowledged that this principle is very easily stretched beyond its proper limits, and therefore ought not to be acted
                           upon but with the greatest caution and prudence. (Calmet) --- St. Paul knew from divine revelation that he was to go to Rome;
                           but this did not hinder the apostle from taking every prudent care of his own life; as we may see from the following chapter.</FONT></P><B>

                           degree of iniquity this nation is come. When any good is in contemplation, none are found to undertake it; whilst all, even
                           the priests too, are ready to concur in any wicked design. (St. Chrysostom, in Act. hom. xlix.) --- To take an unlawful oath
                           is one sin; but to keep it, is another and greater sin: as when Herod, to keep his oath, put to death John the Baptist. (Matthew

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And Paul knowing that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees,
                                    cried out in the council: Men, brethren, *I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees: concerning the hope and resurrection of the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 And when he had said this, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Now a great clamour was raised. And some of the Pharisees rising up,
                                    contended, saying: We find no evil in this man: what if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an Angel?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And when there arose a great dissension, the tribune, fearing lest
                                    Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to
                                    bring him into the castle.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And the night following the Lord standing by him, said: Be constant:
                                    for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And when it was day, some of the Jews assembled together, and bound
                                    themselves with a curse, saying: that they would neither eat, nor drink, till they had killed Paul.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And they were more than forty men that had made this conspiracy.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 They came to the chief priests, and the ancients, and said: We have
                                    bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing, till we kill Paul.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Now, therefore, do you with the council signify to the tribune, that
                                    he bring him forth to you, as if you meant to know something more certain concerning him. And we, before he come near, are
                                    ready to kill him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And when Paul's sister's son had heard of their lying in wait, he
                                    came, and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 Then Paul calling to him one of the centurions, said: Bring this young
                                    man to the tribune, for he hath something to tell him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 So he took him, and brought him to the tribune, and said: Paul, the
                                    prisoner, desired me to bring this young man to thee, who hath something to say to thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And the tribune taking him by the hand, went aside with him privately,
                                    and asked him: What is it that thou hast to tell me?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And he said: The Jews have agreed to desire thee, that thou wouldst
                                    bring forth Paul to-morrow into the council, as if they meant to inquire something more certain concerning him:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 But do not thou give credit to them: for there lie in wait for him
                                    more than forty men of them, who have bound themselves by oath neither to eat nor to drink till they kill him: and they are
                                    now ready waiting for thy promise.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 The tribune, therefore, dismissed the young man, charging him to tell
                                    no man, that he had made known these things to him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Then having called two centurions, he said to them: Make ready two
                                    hundred soldiers, to go as far as Cæsarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, for the third hour of the night:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And provide beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe
                                    to Felix, the governor.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 (For he feared lest perhaps the Jews might take him away by force,
                                    and kill him, and he should afterwards be slandered, as if he was to receive money.)</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 <i>And </i>he wrote a letter after this manner: Claudius Lysias, to
                                    the most excellent governor, Felix, greeting.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 This man being seized by the Jews, and ready to be killed by them,
                                    I rescued coming in with the soldiers, having understand that he is a Roman:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And wishing to know the cause which they objected to him, I brought
                                    him forth into their council.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 Whom I found to be accused of questions of their law: but having nothing
                                    laid to his charge worthy of death, or of chains.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And when it was told me that they had prepared an ambush for him,
                                    I sent him to thee, signifying also to his accusers to plead before thee. Farewell.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 Then the soldiers, according as it was commanded them, taking Paul,
