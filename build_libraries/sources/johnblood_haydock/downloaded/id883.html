                           <i>Libanus.</i> So it was called, on account of the many cedar pillars brought from that mountain; or because many trees and
                           shrubs were planted in the vicinity. (Calmet) --- Libanus might also be seen from it, and refreshing breezes be felt. (Ar.[Arbuthnot?]
                           Mont.[Montanus?]) --- The palace stood on the eastern part of Sion, and to the west of the temple. (Menochius) --- The vale
                           between them had been filled up, at a vast expense, and a sort of bridge erected, which was called Mello. Thus the palace
                           of David, on the west of Sion, and this of Solomon, served to protect the temple, and to keep the citizens in awe. (Salien)
                           --- Sanchez declines giving the dimensions of this palace, as they are not satisfactory. (Menochius) --- Here Solomon resided,
                           and was served in gold, (Calmet) adorning his palace with shields and targets of the same precious metal, chap. x. 16, 21.
                           --- <i>Cubits.</i> The more sacred part of the temple was only 60, 20, and 30 cubits, chap. vi. 2. But there were various
                           other appendages and towers. This palace must have been very extensive. --- <i>And four.</i> Hebrew, "upon four rows of cedar
                           pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars." (Haydock) -- One row of these might be rather pilasters, against the wall; (ver.
                           3,) so that there would be three covered galleries, before the apartments, each supported on 15 pillars. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           nearer the palace. Guards would be stationed in the other. (Haydock) --- This is the idea which travellers have given us of
                           the palaces in the East. They consist of various apartments, galleries, and courts. Under the outward porch there are guards
                           standing, in a double row; and hence there is a communication with other parts of the house, and with the apartments of the
                           women, which are far removed, and inaccessible to strangers. The women still continue to have separate tents, or apartments;
                           as they had in the days of Sara, Esther, Herodias, &amp;c., Genesis xxiv., Esther i. 11., and Matthew xiv. 8. (Calmet) ---

                           on all the four sides, made of three courses of fine large stones, with the fourth of cedar beams, till the whole was completed.

                           is not unusual with regard to imperfect numbers, ver. 1. But Jeremias (lii. 21,) agrees with this passage; and the book of
                           Paralipomenon may not have included a cubit of <i>solid</i> metal at the base or plinth. (Cornelius a Lapide) --- The rest
                           was hollow. The chapiters of five cubits, and the bases, which were perhaps as large, are not contained in the 18 cubits,
                           which might otherwise appear to be disproportionate with the circumference of 12 cubits. The Egyptian pillars are sometimes
                           very thick and low; and their temples bear a great resemblance with that of Solomon, than with those of the Greeks and Romans.

                           <i>Of lily-work,</i> seems also transposed. Calmet would translate, Hebrew, "and he made pomegranates, two rows round each

                           (or <i>lily</i>) at the top of the pillars, above, and over-against the body, which was beyond the nets." The rose seemed
                           to grow out of the pillar. The chapiters were not square, but of a circular form. Pelletier supposes that these pillars were
                           of the ancient Doric order. It is certain that all the chapiter was not in the form of a lily, as the Hebrew would now insinuate,
                           but only the top part of it, chap. v. 22. The long addition of <i>one of the crowns,</i> &amp;c., may be unnecessary, if the
