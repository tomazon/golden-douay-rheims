                           Lord</I> now, by his angel, delivers in an intelligible manner, the ten <I>words,</I> or commandments, which contain the sum
                           of all the natural law, and may be reduced to the two precepts of charity, Matthew xxii. 40; Mark xii. 31. How these commandments
                           are to be divided into ten, the ancients are not perfectly agreed. We follow the authority of St. Augustine, (9. 71,) St.
                           Clement of Alexandria, (strom. 6,) and others, in referring three of the precepts to God, and seven to our neighbour. Protestants
                           adopt the Jewish method, of making four commandments of the first table, and six of the second; as they divide our first into
                           two, and unite the 9th and 10th; though it surely must appear rational to admit a distinct precept, for an internal as well
                           as for an external object; and the desires of committing adultery or theft, require a distinct prohibition no less than the
                           external actions. Whereas the forbidding to have strange gods, or to worship images, or creatures of any description, is exactly
                           of the same tendency. For no one can worship an idol, without admitting a strange god. The latter part, therefore, of the
                           first commandment, or the second of Protestants, is only a farther explanation of what had gone before, as Moses himself clearly
                           insinuates, ver. 23, <I>You shall not make gods of silver,</I> &amp;c.</FONT></P><B>

                           nor serve them.</I> That is, all such as are designed for <I>idols</I> or <I>image gods,</I> or are worshipped with <I>divine
                           honour.</I> But otherwise images, pictures, or representations, even in the house of God, and in the very sanctuary, so far
                           from being forbidden are expressly authorized by the word of God. See Exodus xxv. 15, &amp;c.; chap. xxxviii. 7; Numbers xxi.
                           8, 9; 1 Chronicles xxviii. 18, 19; 2 Chronicles iii. 10. (Challoner) --- Protestants insidiously translate "any graven image,"
                           though pesel, eidolon, glupton, and sculptile, in the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, denote a graven thing or idol. They will,
                           however, hardly condemn his majesty for having his representation stamped upon the coin of the nation, nor so many of our
                           wealthy noblemen, who adorn their rooms with the choicest efforts of painting and of sculpture. They know that the object
                           of prohibition is the making and adoring of <I>idols.</I> But they probably wish to keep the ignorant under the stupid delusion
                           of supposing, that Catholics are idolaters, because they have images, and that they themselves are not, though they have them
                           likewise at home; and even in their churches admit the absurd figures of the lion and the unicorn, stretching their paws over
                           the tables of the law, instead of the pious representations of Jesus expiring on the cross, &amp;c., which were set up by
                           their Catholic ancestors. Let them read, and adopt herein <I>just weights and measures,</I> proposed to them by Thorndike,
                           one of their most discerning and moderate teachers. In the mean time, we will assure them, that we abhor all idols; both those
                           made with hands, and those which are formed by the head of heretics, who set up their own fancies and delusions, to be adored
                           instead of the true God. Our general councils of Nice and of Trent define what we ought to believe on this head; and the matter
                           is so fully explained in our catechisms and books of instruction, as well as from our pulpits, that no person can well remain
                           in ignorance. If we perform various actions of respect before pictures, which are also done in honour of God, can any man
                           of sense infer, that we look upon both with equal respect? Do we not read of the people falling down to shew respect to the
                           king, and supreme worship to God, by the same act of the body? (Haydock) --- Altars and sacrifice we reserve solely for God,
                           as St. Augustine (contra Faust. xx. 21,) well observes. Other indifferent practices must be determined by the intention. ---
                           <I>Latria,</I> or supreme worship, can be given to none but the Deity. But we shew our respect and veneration for his servants
                           in glory, by an inferior service called <I>Dulia,</I> giving <I>honour to whom honour</I> is due. How profane and impious
                           must the words of the first reformers appear, who, after saying most falsely, that "papists make the Virgin Mary a god, (Luther.
                           postil.) and worship images in heathenish manner," (Melanct. Loc. com.) attribute various fictitious crimes to the blessed
                           Virgin and other saints! (Centuriators of Magdeburg; Calvin, &amp;c.) They knew that all the saints abhorred their impiety;
                           and therefore, in revenge, they vilify the saints, and condemn all the doctors and fathers of the Church, since the death
                           of the apostles, as guilty of superstition and idolatry. (Haydock) --- "By this occasion, dead creatures, and bloodless half
                           worm-eaten bones, began to be honoured, invocated, and worshipped with divine honour. All which the doctors of the Church
                           not only winked at, but also set forward." (Centuriators of Magdeburg, C. vi.) What is then become of the promises of God,
                           to teach all the <I>truth</I> by the mouths of his pastors? (Matthew xxviii, &amp;c.) Let others judge, whether we ought to
                           pay greater deference to Saints Jerome, Augustine, Gregory, &amp;c., or to Luther, Calvin, and the Centuriators of Magdeburg.
                           But some will even admit that images were commanded by God, chap. xxv. 18, &amp;c. Hence they lay great stress upon the words
                           <I>to thyself;</I> as if all images were forbidden that man should make, without the express sanction of God. So Parkhurst
                           Lexic. But those who are conversant in Hebrew, know that these words have no such import; and if things were inseparable from
                           idolatry, they could not be sanctioned by God. (Haydock) --- No creature must be represented as a deity. But sovereign worship,
                           both internal and external, must be given to the great Author of all good, while we abstain from every superstitious act,
                           and from all dealings with the devil and false religions. (Calmet) --- Protestants, therefore, who only forbid <I>images,</I>
                           diminish God's law. Were not the idols of Chanaan, Chamos, &amp;c., which represented nothing in nature, also condemned?</FONT></P><B>

                           Protestants translate again, with the same view, as in the preceding verse, "thou shalt not bow down thyself to them," in
                           condemnation of Catholics, who kneel before the cross. But do not they kneel, when they receive their sacramental bread, or
                           when they ask for their parents' blessing? Did not St. John, and other saints, bow down out of respect to angels? And were
                           these all idolaters! We are forbidden, therefore, to shew any respect to strange gods. But we must honour the true God in
                           his saints, referring all the glory to him. (Haydock) --- <I>Hate me.</I> Those who do not imitate their wicked ancestors,
                           need not fear being involved in their punishment. (Menochius) (St. Augustine, q. 42; St. Gregory, mor. 15. 22; St. Jerome
                           in Ezechiel xviii.) --- Sometimes, indeed, God takes away the lives of children and of subjects, to punish the sins of parents
                           and of kings; but this may be no real detriment to the deceased. (Haydock) --- Grotius thinks, that this menace is directed
                           against idolaters. Others believe, it may be placed at the conclusion of each of the commandments. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           might suffice to have obviated the mistake of Josephus, and of the Jews, in our Saviour's time, who looked upon them as indifferent,
                           provided they were not carried into effect. They render us guilty in the sight of God, (Matthew v. 28,) whenever we give consent
                           to them, as even Ovid and the pagan philosophers acknowledged. (Grotius) --- At the conclusion of this 10th commandment, we
                           find five verses in the Samaritan copy and version, as well as in the Arabic, and a sufficient vacant space is left in an
                           ancient Syriac manuscript translated from the Hebrew, which induce Kennicott (Dis. 2. p. 97,) to conclude that they are genuine;
                           particularly as they explain what law was to be engraven on the two stones set up by Josue, which the Hebrew leaves ambiguous.
                           They are as follows, repeated, for the most part, Deuteronomy xxvii. 2. "And it shall come to pass, when the Lord thy God
                           shall bring thee into the land of the Chanaanites, whither thou goest to possess it, then thou shalt set thee up great stones;
                           and thou shalt plaster them with plaster, and shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law. --- And it shall come
                           to pass, when ye are passed over the Jordan, ye shall put these stones, which I command you this day, upon Mount Gerizim.
                           --- And thou shalt build there an altar to the Lord thy <FONT size=3>God,</FONT> an altar of stones; thou shalt not lift up
                           any iron tool upon them. --- Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God&nbsp;<FONT size=3>of whole stones, and shalt offer
                           thereon burnt-offerings to the Lord thy God</FONT>, and shalt sacrifice peace-offerings; and thou shalt eat there, and rejoice
                           before the Lord thy God. --- That mountain is on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of
                           the Chanaanites, which dwell in the flat country over-against Gilgal, beside the plain of Moreh, near Sichem." This particular
                           designation of <I>Gerizim,</I> makes Calmet suspect, that it is an interpolation of the Samaritans. But Kennicott hesitates
                           not to lay the blame of omission upon the Jews; as he endeavours to shew, that they have corrupted Deuteronomy xxvii. 4, substituting
                           <I>Hebal,</I> instead of Gerizim. "Certainly the Jews <I>might omit,</I> as easily as the Samaritans <I>might insert.</I>"

                           Iron was not used about the tabernacle or temple, as brass was more common. Altars raised in haste, like that, Deuteronomy
                           xxvii. and Josue viii. 30, and that which was designed for the ratification of the covenant, (chap. xxiv. 4,) were required
                           to be of this construction, unpolished and simple, as was the altar erected, 1 Machabees iv. 47. But other altars were not

                           These were afterwards allowed in the temple, Ezechiel xliii. 17. The Egyptians made use of their pyramids for altars; and
                           some suppose, that the high places of Juda were of a similar nature, and exposed the priests, who wore long robes without
                           breeches, to the danger of being seen, chap. xxviii. 42. The steps allowed by God were therefore very low, and enclosed with
                           boards, after the Greek fashion. Such were used by the priest and priestess of Jupiter. (Servius in Æneid iv. 646.) Linen
