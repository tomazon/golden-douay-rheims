                           heard a great voice.</I> Bossuet explains the pouring out of the seven vials in this manner. The five first he supposes to
                           have taken place under the reign of Valerian and Gallien; the sixth he supposes to have been poured out during the reigns
                           of Valerian, Dioclesian, and Julian; and the seventh under Honorius and the Alani. (Bossuet) --- All commentators, however,
                           seem to agree that the great city mentioned in the 19th verse, is to be understood of Rome, and that the plagues which are
                           here foretold, are denounced against her. (Calmet, Pastorini, &amp;c.) --- <I>Go and pour out the seven vials,</I> &amp;c.
                           According to the exposition followed by the bishop of Meaux[Bossuet], all these seven vials are already past, being punishments
                           and judgments exercised against the heathen emperors, from the time of Valerian even to the time of Julian, at whose death
                           it might be said, (ver. 17) <I>it is done.</I> Idolatry is destroyed, as to its public worship. Here in particular, by the
                           drying up of the Euphrates, and by the armies of the East, these interpreters understand those of the Persians, who first
                           gave the great shock to the empire in Valerian's time, and by whom afterwards Julian the apostate was defeated, and killed.
                           By the great Babylon they also understand idolatrous Rome; and by the islands and mountains sunk by earthquakes, they understand
                           the destruction of divers kingdoms. According to another interpretation, (which is very common) all these judgments are to
                           come before the end of the world; and will be in a manner literally executed about antichrist's time. At the first vial, men
                           shall be struck with ulcers and wounds, not unlike to the sixth plague of Egypt. At the second and third vial, the sea and
                           fountains shall be turned into blood, as in Egypt. At the fourth vial shall be excessive scorching heats, tormenting men,
                           and burning every thing for their use. At the fifth vial darkness, like that of Egypt. At the sixth vial, (ver. 12.) the Euphrates
                           dried up, to open a passage for the armies from the East, to come and join the forces of antichrist. And the three unclean
                           spirits like frogs, may signify devils sent by the dragon, or chief of the devils, to excite the wicked to all manner of unclean
                           abominations. They are here said to be gathered together in a place called Armagedon, perhaps with an allusion to Mageddon,
                           in the tribe of Manasses, where the two kings of Israel, Ochozias and Josias, perished. (4 Kings ix. 21.) And they are brought
                           in only to signify a place of great destruction. See also Zacharias xii. 11. At the seventh vial, a voice, <I>it is done,</I>
                           i.e. the reign of the wicked in general, and of antichrist, is at an end. (Witham)<BR></P></FONT><B>

                           the first.</I> From hence it appears that the first vial was poured out indiscriminately upon the good equally with the wicked.
                           But behold the different consequences that follow: those that have the mark of the beast are afflicted with a sore and grievous
                           wound, which is said in allusion to the madness, fury, and despair with which the wicked were afflicted, whilst St. John's
                           omitting to say any thing of the just, shews that they bore it with resignation and joy. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           the second.</I> On pouring out the vial follows the divine judgment. There appears blood, like that of a dead man. This passage,
                           Pastorini is of opinion alludes to the Arian heresy, which, like blood, flowed in vigorous circulation whilst in health and
                           strength, gradually retarded its motion, as in a dying man, and was at last totally lost and stopped, like the circulation
                           in a dead man. Hence every living soul died in the sea. (Pastorini) --- Calmet interprets it as a prediction of the calamities
                           which befell the Roman empire, during the invasion of the Persians on the east, and the Goths and other barbarous nations
                           on the west. </FONT></P><B>

                           over the Roman states, cries out, (ver. 5, 6.) <I>thou art just,</I> &amp;c. (Pastorini)</FONT></P><B>

                           to ashes, and the whole town to flames. Hence it appears how the Greeks were scorched with great heat; and how they blasphemed

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">1 And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven Angels:
                                    Go, and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">2 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth, and there
                                    fell a sore and most grievous wound upon the men, who had the mark of the beast; and upon them who adored his image.</font></p>

                                    blood as of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 And the third poured out his vial upon the rivers, and the fountains

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And I heard the Angel of the waters, saying: Thou art just, O Lord,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 For they have shed the blood of the saints and prophets, and thou hast
                                    given them blood to drink; for they deserve it.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And the fourth Angel poured out his vial upon the sun, and it was given
                                    to him to afflict men with heat, and fire:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name
                                    of God who hath power over these plagues, neither did they penance to give him glory.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And the fifth Angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast:
                                    and his kingdom became dark, and they gnawed their tongues for pain:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And they blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 And the sixth Angel poured out his vial upon that great river Euphrates:
                                    and dried up the water thereof, that a way might be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And I saw from the mouth of the dragon, and from the mouth of the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 For they are the spirits of devils working signs, and they go forth

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And he shall gather them together into a place, which is called in
