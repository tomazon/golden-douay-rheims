                           the divine oracles; (Menochius) and his authority must have had great weight, since David began to take precautions, only
                           after he had heard that Achitophel had joined the rebels; and Absalom was persuaded (Calmet) to perpetrate so foul and unnatural
                           a crime publicly, no one daring to make any opposition. Chusai was silent; as he was aware that, if he began to contradict
                           this counsellor at first, he would only incur suspicion. (Haydock) --- The unjust commonly endeavour by all means to attach

                                    thence a man of the kindred of the house of Saul, named Semei, the son of Gera; and coming out, *he cursed as he went on.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of king David:

                                    Let him alone, and let him curse: for the Lord hath bid him curse David: and who is he that shall dare say, why hath he done
                                    so?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And the king said to Abisai, and to all his servants: Behold my son,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And when Chusai, the Arachite, David's friend, was come to Absalom,
                                    he said to him: God save thee, O king; God save thee, O king.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And Absalom said to him: Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Why wentest

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And Chusai answered Absalom: Nay: for I will be his whom the Lord
                                    hath chosen, and all this people, and all Israel, and with him will I abide.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 Besides this, whom shall I serve? is it not the king's son? As I have

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And Absalom said to Achitophel: Consult what we are to do.</font></p>

                                    whom he hath left to keep the house: that when all Israel shall hear that thou hast disgraced thy father, their hands may

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 *So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the house; and he
