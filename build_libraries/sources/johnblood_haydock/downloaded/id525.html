                           or better adapted to the subject. Moses calls those who never die to witness what he asserts, as if to insinuate that these
                           truths ought never to be forgotten. See Numbers iv. 6. Virgil (Æneid xii.) imitates this style, <I>Esto nunc sol testis &amp;
                           hæc mihi terra precanti,</I> (Calmet) which he puts in the mouth of Æneas, to whom Latinus replies, <I>Hæc eadem Ænea, terram,

                           penetrate your hearts. (Haydock) --- Chaldean, "may my discourse be as delightful as the rain." Septuagint, "may my apophthegm
                           (or sententious discourse, Calmet) be expected with earnestness, like rain," when the soil is thirsty. (Haydock) --- Preachers

                           this and the former term in the original, of "a stormy and vehement shower," while others attach this idea only to the last
                           part of the sentence. (Calmet) --- The lawgiver wishes to engage the hearts of his audience by mildness, though he is forced
                           also to thunder, in order to rouse their attention, ver. 15. (Haydock) --- Sound doctrine produces much fruit in good dispositions,

                           or idolatry. The fidelity of God is contrasted with the infidelity of his people, who deserve not to be called his children.
                           The Septuagint, Chaldean, Syriac, and Arabic, seem to have read in a different manner from what the Hebrew does at present.
                           (Calmet) --- As it stands it is quite unintelligible: <I>Corrupit, non filii ejus, macula eorum.</I> Two letters have been
                           carelessly inserted, and <I>la</I> has been placed after <I>lu,</I> contrary to the Samaritan text, which is perfectly clear:
                           "They are corrupted, they are not his, <I>but filii maculæ,</I> children defiled." (Houbigant, prol. 75.) --- Capellus (p.
                           288,) condemns the Septuagint as he follows a wrong punctuation, and translates, "they did not sin against him, reprehensible
                           children;" whereas, it more properly signifies, "they sinned, not his, <I>but</I> children deserving reprehension, (<I>or</I>
                           children of blame, they did not belong or stick close to him) being a crooked and perverse generation." (Haydock) --- Their
                           wickedness cannot be attributed to God. He is no less powerful and holy, though they have given themselves up to the service
                           of idols. (St. Augustine, q. 55.) (Calmet) --- He had given them all necessary instructions and assistance; so that, finding
                           them always prone to evil, the more favours he heaped upon them, he was on the point of exterminating all the guilty at once,

                           He suffered the people of Chanaan to occupy as much land as would be requisite for the Israelites. Septuagint, "according
                           to the number of the angels of God." Hence many of the ancients gathered that there were seventy angel guardians of provinces,
                           and as many languages; while others did not pretend to determine the exact number. But the version which they have followed,
                           is in opposition to all the rest. (Calmet) --- They have also disputed on this occasion, whether the elect will be equal in
                           number to the good angels, as St. Gregory thinks; (hom. 34, in Luke xv.) or they will only fill up the places of those who
                           have fallen. See Mag. Sent. ii. 9. Abenezra observes, that interpreters understand this text as alluding to the dispersion
                           of nations, (Genesis xi.) when God decreed that the land of the seven nations should belong to and be sufficient for the Israelites.
                           (Amama) (Haydock) --- The Hebrew may be rendered, "He fixed the limits of each people. At that time the children of Israel
                           were few in number, (<STRONG>9</STRONG>) when the Lord chose his people," &amp;c. Long after the division of the earth, (which
                           the Lord had ordered, Acts xvii. 26,) the Israelites were very few in number, as Jacob observes, Genesis xxxiv. 30. See chap.
                           xxvi. 5., and Psalm civ. 9, 12. (Calmet) --- But this explication does not satisfy Houbigant, (p. 76, Prol.) no more than
                           that of Le Clerc. He is convinced that a word has been transposed, and another left out, as the Samaritan copy has Israel
                           twice, and he would therefore translate, "He divided his people according to the number of the sons of Israel." In his eternal
                           decrees, He allotted twelve portions of land in Chanaan to the descendants of Jacob, and these Josue was ordered to mark out
                           for them. See Josue iv. 5. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Hebrew literally, "the cord," in allusion to the ancient method of dividing lands with a cord. Herodotus (ii. 6,) observes,
                           that the length of one, in the Upper Egypt, was 60 stadia, or 7700 paces, while it was only half as much in the Lower Egypt.</FONT></P><B>

                           ones to fly, and when she sees them exhausted, she takes them upon her back. This similitude shews the extreme affection of
                           God towards his people. Hebrew and Chaldean may also be, "as an eagle makes (Calmet; or stirs up) her nest, hatches her young,

                           fertile countries east of the Jordan, where there were several high mountains. (Haydock) --- But when this canticle should

                           Moses in singing the canticle, as his colleague in office, to whom the obligation of withdrawing the people from idolatry
