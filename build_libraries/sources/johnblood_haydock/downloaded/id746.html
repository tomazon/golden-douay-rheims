                           20, and 25. --- St. Jerome, "the morning stag." (Haydock) --- Many of the titles are almost inexplicable, and this is one
                           of the most puzzling; (Calmet) but is of no service for understanding the psalm, which certainly speaks of Jesus Christ, as
                           the apostles have quoted several texts, and Theodorus of Mopsuesta was condemned for asserting that it was only accommodated
                           to him. (Conc. v. col. 4.) (Berthier) --- Grotius comes too near this system, by explaining it of Christ only in a figurative
                           sense. We ought to do quite the reverse, if we allow that some verses regard David, as a figure of the Messias; (Calmet) or
                           rather, as the same person speaks throughout, we must understand the whole of Him. (Berthier, t. ii.) --- The Jews were formerly
                           of the same opinion, (Lyranus) but seeing the use which was made of this psalm by Christians, they have explained it of David,
                           or of the miseries of the nation. Septuagint seem to intimate that this psalm was sung at the morning service, (Calmet) or
                           referred to the coming, or resurrection of our Saviour, (St. Augustine; Worthington; Psalm iii. 6.; Menochius) after the long
                           night of infidelity. (Didymus) --- He is represented as the hart, or beautiful hind, whom the Jews hunted unto death, ver.
                           17. Some band of musicians might be styled, after "the morning hind," as another seems to be after "the mute dove;" (Psalm
                           lv.) and <I>the wine presses,</I> or "band of Geth;" (Psalm viii., &amp;c.) though we cannot pretend to give a reason for
                           these titles. Many, who are unwilling to confess their ignorance, say that these terms allude to some musical instrument,
                           or favourite song, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- It would be as well to speak plainly that these things are hidden from us. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B></B>

                           would now read, <I>Eli....lama</I> (or <I>lamach.;</I> Tirinus) <I>hazabtani;</I> (Calmet) and in our method, <I>ali....lome

                           But it must be admitted (Haydock) that the true pronunciation is irretrievably lost. The Masorets vary from the ancient versions,
                           (Masclef.; Capel; Houbigant; Mr. C. Butler, Hor. Bib. 4 edit. p. 69.) and from one another; so that after being at the immense
                           labour of learning their rules, we shall be no more secure of attaining the truth. (Haydock) --- It were, therefore, greatly
                           to be wished that the learned would agree about some characters to express uniformly the Hebrew in modern languages, as it
                           would greatly facilitate the knowledge of the sacred writings. (Kennicott, Diss. i. p. 243.) --- We have only attempted to
                           use such as might inform the reader what letters were in the original; and yet we are sorry to find that <I>z,</I> or the
                           long <I>a</I> and <I>e</I> are often printed without the mark above; which shews the inconvenience of so many points, introduced
                           by the Masorets. (Haydock) --- <I>Look upon me,</I> are words admitted by Christ, "because (says Eusebius) they are not in
                           Hebrew." But this reason is not conclusive, as he might have left them out, though they were in the original. The Septuagint
                           may have rendered one <I>ali,</I> in this sense, "to me," as they have not added <I>my</I> to the first mention of <I>God:</I>
                           or, they may have anticipated from ver. 20 (Berthier) this explication. Christ speaks with reference to his sacred humanity,
                           as his divinity suspended its beatific influence, that he might drink the bitter chalice. (Theodoret; St. Jerome) --- He also
                           speaks the language of his afflicted members, who think they are abandoned. (St. Augustine) Calmet) --- <I>Sins.</I> That
                           is, the sins of the world, which I have taken upon myself, cry out against me, and are the cause of all my sufferings. (Challoner)
                           --- An ancient psalm of St. Germ. reads "lips," instead of <I>sins.</I> Hebrew, "roaring." (St. Jerome) (Calmet) --- "Prayer,"
                           Sixtine Edition. "Why art thou so far from helping me, <I>and from </I>the words of my roaring?" (Protestants) (Haydock) ---
                           The Septuagint seem to have read <I>shagathi,</I> whereas the Hebrew places the <I>g</I> after the <I>a,</I> or they have
                           substituted the cause for the effect; as sin was certainly the cause of Christ's affliction, and of his Father's not granting
                           present relief. Indeed our Saviour did not ask for it, but only expressed the sentiments of suffering nature, which he corrected
                           by the most perfect submission, to teach us how to behave. (Berthier) --- God is the God of all creatures, but more particularly
                           of Christ, by personal union. (Worthington) --- The latter tenderly expostulates, (Haydock) that he is not comforted like
                           other saints, (Matthew xxvii. 46.) since he had undertaken to die for the sins of the world, and reputed them as his own.
                           (Worthington) --- <I>Delicta nostra sua delicta fecit, ut justitiam suam nostram justitiam faceret.</I> (St. Augustine) ---
                           He speaks in the name of his members. (St. Thomas Aquinas, 3. p. q. 15. a 1.) --- Christ could commit no sin: (1 Peter ii.
                           21., and 2 Corinthians v. 21.) but as long as he had taken our iniquities upon himself, to expiate with his own blood, he
                           could not be at ease till he had perfected the work. David was convinced that his own sins were punished by the rebellion
                           of Absalom, as Nathan had declared, 2 Kings xii. 10. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B></B>

                           My cry proceeds not from impotent rage, Luke iv. 28. (Eusebius, Agel.) (Menochius) --- I know that thou wilt grant my request.
                           (Calmet) --- I shall not cry in vain. (Theodoret) --- It is not for my own folly that I suffer. (Geneb.) --- "Many cry and
                           are not heard, yet it is for their advantage, and not out of folly." (St. Augustine) --- Christ prayed on the cross, as he
                           had done in the garden, to have the bitter chalice removed. But this was not blameable, as it was done with entire submission.
                           (Worthington) --- The cry of the lips, or of human nature, which would be free from suffering, was not heard: (Haydock) because
                           the cry of the heart, which desired that the justice of God should be satisfied, was much louder; and this petition was granted
                           by Him who denied nothing to his Son, John xi. 41. (Calmet) --- This should be our model. Submission and perseverance will
                           always be crowned. Hebrew has now <I>d</I> instead of <I>r,</I> in the word <I>dumiya,</I> "silence," which is also good;
                           "there is no silence for me." In the night (Berthier) of death, (Haydock) God granted the petition. (Berthier) --- Aquila
                           gives this idea, <I>non tacebis,</I> as St. Jerome observes: "thou wilt do what I desire." Hebrew may also mean: I have no
                           rest, <I>or</I> I cry incessantly. (Calmet) --- The prayer of Christ for relief, was conditional. He absolutely desired God's
                           will to be accomplished, and thus he was heard, ver. 25., and Hebrews v. 7. He was our pattern. (St. Augustine, ep. 120.)

                           he is God. Why a worm? because a mortal, born of the flesh, without generation." The ancient naturalists supposed that worms
                           were not generated; and though this be now deemed inaccurate, the Fathers applied this notion to <I>confirm</I> the doctrine
                           of our Saviour's being born of a virgin, which had been clearly revealed. (Calmet) --- <I>People.</I> God afforded Christ
                           no exterior (Haydock) or common consolation, while the wicked persecutors treated him as a worm. (Worthington) --- The rights
                           of humanity are respected in the greatest criminals. But the enemies of our Lord added insult to torments, Isaias lii. 14.
                           (Berthier) --- It would be difficult to apply this to David. For even in the depth of his misery, when reviled by Semei, and
                           dishonoured by Absalom, he was attended by the priests, and by a powerful army. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B></B>

                           dogs, as they are by St. Paul, Philippians iii. 2. (St. Jerome) --- The evangelists could scarcely have explained the authors,
                           and manner of our Saviour's death more particularly; so that we might entitle this "the Passion of Jesus Christ, according

                           like a lion," &amp;c., in some editions only; which shews the antiquity of this variation, (Haydock) as the author, Joseph
                           the blind, is supposed to have lived in the 4th century, though this is uncertain. (Calmet) --- All the ancient versions of
                           the Septuagint, Syriac, &amp;c., agree with us, as the Protestants do likewise. Even the Masora intimates that <I>cari</I>
                           has not here the sense "of like a lion," as it has [in] Isaias xxxviii. 13; and, though it might be pointed so as to signify
                           the same as <I>caru,</I> they have rejected that punctuation, and obstinately maintain their reading, in opposition to many
                           manuscripts seen by Ben. Chaim, &amp;c. (Berthier) --- Kennicott mentions another manuscript in the Bod. Lib. which has <I>caru,</I>
                           with <I>cari</I> in the margin; and observes that Dr. Pocock, nevertheless, maintains the accuracy of the Hebrew edition in
                           this, as well as in every other instance, asserting that <I>car</I> is <I>perfodit,</I> and <I>cari</I> the part.[participle?]
                           Benoni, <I>perfodientes,</I> with the <I>m</I> omitted. "But as this omission is very irregular, and never proper but before
                           a suffixed pronoun, or in construct.; and as the ancient versions express it....as a verb, there seems to be but little doubt
                           that this word was originally <I>cru</I> or <I>caru,</I> with an <I>a</I> inserted to express the kametz." (Dis. 1. p. 500.)
                           The proposed interpretation would be rejected by the Jews, while they would exult in their error being countenanced by us.
                           (Calmet, Diss.) --- This reason is perhaps (Haydock) weak, as their conversion is not expected; if by means of it, the Hebrew
                           Bible may be reconciled with the versions; "the council....hath besieged me, digging my hands." (Berthier) --- But this expedient
                           is at least doubtful; (Haydock) suggested only by Protestants who maintained the integrity of the Hebrew text, which is now
                           given up; and the Jews seem inexcusable, though the variation might originally arise (Calmet) from a mistake of transcribers.
                           (Houbigant) --- They ought not to have rejected <I>caru</I> even from the margin, which they confess was once in the text,
                           as it is still in very correct copies. Drusius informs us that a Jew threatened Bomberg, when he designed to adopt this correction,
                           that if he did, he would prevent any of his brethren from purchasing a single copy. The pusillanimity of Christians, and the
                           obstinacy of the Jews, keep therefore the text in its present state. (Amam, p. 461.) --- Ximenes had the courage to insert
                           <I>caru</I> in his Polyglot. (Calmet) --- In the edition of St. Jerome, 1533, <I>caru</I> appears indeed in the margin; as
                           he translated <I>fixerunt,</I> "they pierced," and <I>cru</I> in that of Mont. with <I>o</I> over <I>cari,</I> perhaps as
                           a sign that the former was formerly in the margin, or should be translated, as it is by Pagnin, <I>foderunt; </I>though Mont.
                           alters it for <I>circumdederunt me, sicut leo manus meas,</I> in obedience to the Jews. (Haydock) --- Thus we behold what
                           dissensions the alteration of a single <I>u</I> or <I>i</I> may occasion; (Psalm xv. 10.) and yet these are letters which
                           the Jews seem to have treated with little ceremony, (Haydock) changing in 100 instances, (Calmet) or omitting them, since
                           the introduction of the vowel points; (Houbigant) and they are so easily mistaken, that the greatest attention is requisite
                           to make the distinction. However, <I>one jot or one tittle shall not pass of the law till all be fulfilled,</I> Matthew v.

                           <I>Brethren.</I> So Christ styles his disciples, principally (Calmet) after his resurrection, Matthew xxviii. 10., John xx.
                           17., and Hebrews ii 11. St. Paul quotes this passage, which may convince us that this psalm relates to our Saviour alone;
                           and he informs us, that we are brethren of Christ, because we spring from Adam, (Berthier) and are adopted by God: whence
                           the apostles assume the title of children of God, after baptism, Romans viii. 15., and 29., and Ephesians i. 5. (Calmet) ---

                           --- St. Augustine here refutes the Donatists, who pretended that God's church was confined to a small part of Africa, and
                           that he had abandoned the Catholic Church. He shews that this conduct would be injurious to God, and contrary to his solemn

                           <I>Great Church;</I> the Catholic Church, dispersed throughout the world, in which many adore God in spirit and truth. (St.
                           Jerome) --- Here Jesus Christ praises his Father by the mouth of his priests and faithful, in whom the spirit works. Hebrew,
                           "From thee <I>shall proceed</I> my praise," in the great Church. (Calmet) --- Protestants, "congregation." (Haydock) --- The
                           Vulgate may have the same meaning, as the desire to <I>praise</I> comes from God. The Church which Jesus founded immediately
                           after his resurrection, to <I>pay his vows,</I> must last unto the end; otherwise this service would be interrupted. This
                           can only be verified in the Catholic Church, as she alone can prove her uninterrupted existence. She alone is spread throughout
                           the earth, united under the same pastors, and partaking of the same sacraments. If the Church failed after three or four centuries,
                           the vows of Christ must have ceased. Yet he assures us, that he will pay them as long as his kingdom shall continue, ver.
                           29. --- <I>Fear him.</I> Houbigant would substitute "thee." This change of persons is however very proper and remarkable,
                           as Christ no longer addresses his Father, but gives a description of the worship which should be exhibited in his Church.
                           (Berthier) --- The eucharistic sacrifice is the vow here specified, which Christ offers by his priests daily. It is the only
                           sacrifice of the new law, and the most perfect means of acknowledging God's supreme dominion, &amp;c. (St. Augustine; St.
                           Jerome, &amp;c.) (Calmet)</FONT></P><B></B>

                           <I>Poor.</I> Hebrew <I>hanavim,</I> means also, "quiet and modest men," such as our Saviour calls <I>poor in spirit,</I> Matthew
                           v. 3. These alone ought to partake of the holy sacraments. (Haydock) --- The psalmist may allude to the feasts prescribed
                           by the law, (Deuteronomy xii. 7., and xxvi. 11.) and imitated in the love-feasts of the primitive Christians. The sacrifices
                           of thanksgiving were symbols of that of the blessed Eucharist, of which the Fathers explain this text. (Theodoret; St. Augustine,
                           &amp;c.) (Calmet) --- Indeed, as it speaks of the times of the new law, this must be the meaning. (Haydock) --- It describes
                           that part of the Christian worship, which consists in participating of those sacred mysteries which give life to the humble
                           and worthy receiver, John vi. Protestants explain this eating, to mean "instruction." But that may be given any where; and
                           the psalmist alludes to the public service, which is to be performed in the midst of the Church. Calmet would understand it
                           of David, and of the sacrifices of the old law: which throws all into confusion. (Berthier) --- The apostles clearly refer
                           the text to Jesus Christ, who promised to institute the blessed Eucharist, after he had fed the multitudes, (John vi.) and
                           he fulfilled his promise at the last supper. (St. Augustine, ep. cxx. 27.) --- This holy doctor observes, that the rich, or
                           the <I>fat ones, have eaten and have adored,</I> (ver. 30.) but yet are not filled, because they disdain to be humble. He
                           speaks not of mere bread and wine, which cannot be lawfully <I>adored;</I> nor of Christ's body on the cross, or in heaven,
                           which "is not eaten, but as it is in the forms of bread and wine on <I>Christ's table,</I> the altar." (Worthington) --- Those
                           who approach unworthily sign their own condemnation, which they bear about in their bodies. (Haydock) --- <I>Their.</I> Hebrew,
                           "your," though St. Jerome, Chaldean, Syriac, &amp;c., agree with us. The sense is the same. My friends shall partake of the
                           victims in abundance, after my restoration. "But the text is more naturally explained of the food....which we receive in the
                           blessed Eucharist," and which imparts life eternal. The strong may partake, but they must first become mean in their own eyes.
                           (Calmet) --- The faithful and humble only derive benefit from this great sacrament. Its effect is a glorious resurrection
                           in eternal life. (Worthington) --- The sounder Protestants maintain that Christ is to be <I>adored</I> "in the symbols, before
                           receiving." (Thorndike) See Answer to Slack, p. 14.</FONT></P><B></B>

                           <I>Remember.</I> Our Saviour says, <I>Do this in remembrance of me.</I> (Haydock) --- We must recollect what Christ has suffered
                           and done for us, what was the condition of the world at his coming, and what the behaviour of his first disciples. These reflections
                           will surely fill our breasts with love, admiration, and shame. The first Christians met together to break bread, they preached
                           the word, and brought many to the faith. (Berthier) --- We cannot explain this of David, except in a very exaggerated sense.
                           But all is clear if we understand it of Jesus Christ, whose faith many nations have embraced, assembling to celebrate his
                           sacred mysteries, and the festivals of his birth, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- The Gentiles shall enter into themselves, when they

                           is often observed, Psalm vi. 6., and Isaias xxxviii. 18. (Calmet) --- Chaldean, "the Lord will not give life to the wicked;
                           but the race of Abraham shall praise him." Others again explain it of Jesus Christ, "because he has not spared his life,"

                           sometimes signifies "because," and though it is not clear that it has this meaning here, the explication is very beautiful.
                           None of the Greek versions admit the negation. They agree with the Vulgate; only Theodotion reads, "his soul;" making the
                           prophet speak instead of the Messias. It is suspected that the Septuagint read <I>i</I> instead of <I>v,</I> and <I>lu</I>

                           1 Paralipomenon xi. 20., in Hebrew we read that Abisai had "no (<I>la</I>) name among the three;" whereas it ought to be the
                           reverse, (<I>lu</I>) <I>ei nomen inter tres,</I> "he was renowned," &amp;c. (Berthier) --- St. Jerome agrees with the present
                           Hebrew, "and his soul shall not live." Protestants, "and none can keep alive his own soul." Symmachus, "whose soul shall live,
                           and seed shall serve him." (Haydock) --- "The Messias shall live for God, and his posterity shall serve him," (Berthier) as

                                    <P>And they have looked and stared upon me. 19 *They parted my garments amongst them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.</P>
                                    <P>20 But thou, O Lord, remove not thy help to a distance from me; look towards my defence.</P>
                                    <P>21 Deliver, O God, my soul from the sword: my only one from the hand of the dog.</P>
                                    <P>22 Save me from the lion's mouth; and my lowness from the horns of the unicorns.</P>
                                    <P>23 *I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I praise thee.</P>
                                    <P>24 Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: all ye, the seed of Jacob, glorify him.</P>
                                    <P>25 Let all the seed of Israel fear him: because he hath not slighted nor despised the supplication of the poor man.</P>
                                    <P>Neither hath he turned away his face from me: and when I cried to him he heard me.</P>
                                    <P>26 With thee is my praise in a great church: I will pay my vows in the sight of them that fear him.</P>
                                    <P>27 The poor shall eat and shall be filled; and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: their hearts shall live for ever
                                    and ever.</P>
                                    <P>28 All the ends of the earth shall remember, and shall be converted to the Lord.</P>
                                    <P>And all the kindreds of the Gentiles shall adore in his sight.</P>
                                    <P>29 For the kingdom is the Lord's; and he shall have dominion over the nations.</P>
                                    <P>30 All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: all they that go down to the earth shall fall before him.</P>
                                    <P>31 And to him my soul shall live: and my seed shall serve him.</P>
                                    <P>32 There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come: and the heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that
                                    shall be born, which the Lord hath made.</P></FONT></FONT>
