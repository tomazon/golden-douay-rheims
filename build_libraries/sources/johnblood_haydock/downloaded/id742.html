                           This title is almost wholly taken from the book of Kings, except <i>Unto the end for;</i> instead of which we read, <i>And
                           David spoke,</i> &amp;c., [2 Kings xxii.] (Haydock) which are the words of the inspired writer; so that Ferrand is very rash
                           in rejecting both these titles. David wrote this psalm after he had subdued the Moabites, &amp;c. (Calmet) --- He was inspired
                           to write it (Worthington) twice, with some variations, (Berthier) 74 in number, (Aberbanel) or many more, if we believe Kennicott,
                           who lays them to the charge of transcribers, perhaps, (Haydock) with greater reason. (Calmet) --- We cannot doubt but this
                           psalm regards David. But there are some passages which refer to Jesus Christ and his Church more directly; and in general,
                           David must here be considered as only (Berthier) the figure of the Messias, and of the just in his Church. (Worthington) ---
                           James Paine has endeavoured to prove, with great ingenuity, that the whole must be explained of Jesus Christ, and that the
                           name of <i>Saul</i> stands for "the grave;" as the points which are of modern date, only need to be changed. Thus the sufferings
                           of our Saviour, and the punishment of the Jews in the last siege of Jerusalem are described; and thus it is clear that St.
                           Paul (Romans xv. 9.) has cited this psalm in it proper sense. (Berthier) --- See ver. 10, 41. --- Sts. Jerome and Augustine
                           explain it of the victories of David, of the Messias, and of his Church. (Calmet) --- <i>Saul</i> may be particularly mentioned,
                           because he was the most powerful. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           in the Psalms, giving the sense of the Hebrew. (Worthington) --- Others attribute the variations to David, or to the mistake
                           of transcribers. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Firmament.</i> Hebrew, "rock and my citadel, and my deliverer. My God, (<i>or</i> strong one) my rock." St. Jerome, "my
                           strong one." The two words which are rendered "my rock," are <i>salhi</i> and <i>metsudathi.</i> (Haydock) --- David frequently
                           retired to such places for safety. The idea was beautiful and striking. Such a multiplicity of titles shews the gratitude
                           (Calmet) and affection which David felt. (Calmet) --- Here are nine, and we may add the three metaphorical Hebrew terms, "rock,
                           citadel, and buckler." Can we refuse to love One from whom we have received so many favours? --- <i>And in,</i> &amp;c. These
                           words are most probably cited by St. Paul, (Hebrews ii. 13.) though they occur also in Isaias viii. 18. --- <i>Protector.</i>
                           Hebrew, "buckler." (Berthier) --- <i>Horn.</i> This title is given to Jesus Christ, Luke i. 69. It is an allusion to beasts
                           which attack their opponents with their horns (Theodoret; Deuteronomy xxxiii. 17.) being an emblem of strength (Worthington)
                           and glory. (Calmet) --- <i>And my,</i> &amp;c. (2 Kings) <i>he lifteth me up and </i>is <i>my refuge; my Saviour, thou wilt
                           deliver me from iniquity.</i> Hebrew, "violence."</font></p><b>

                           <i>Praising.</i> Hebrew, "praised;" and (2 Kings) <i>the Lord, who is worthy to be praised.</i> (Haydock) --- Chaldean agrees
                           here with the Septuagint and Vulgate, which seems more natural. (Calmet) --- The sense is the same. (Berthier)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Sorrows...iniquity.</i> Hebrew, "cables....Belial." By these figurative expressions, David declares to what dangers he
                           had been exposed. They seem to be more applicable to our Saviour's agony. (Berthier) --- The wicked were constantly laying
                           snares for both. We have the same idea enforced in the next verse. (Haydock) --- The words are put into the mouth of fallen
                           man, in <i>the mass</i> for Septuagesima[the third Sunday before Lent]. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           past, they seem to be as well expressed here as they are in Duport's Greek Psalms. (Berthier) --- Both are true; as David
                           had prayed, and would continue to pray, for God's protection; otherwise he would have deserved to lose it. We must always
                           pray, and never faint. (Haydock) --- <i>Temple,</i> "from my heart;" (St. Augustine) from the tabernacle at Gabaon, (Lyranus)
                           or from heaven. (Chaldean) (Eusebius) (Calmet) --- Earnest prayer is the best remedy against temptations and affliction. God

                           Yet he displayed his power on the mountains, as if he had been displeased <i>with them,</i> or with the <i>enemies</i> (ver.
                           4.) whom he would thus strike with awe. (Haydock) --- These expressions are not to be taken in a gross literal sense. (Calmet)
                           --- God shewed himself as earnest in the protection of David, (Haydock) as if he had been in a rage; (Calmet) or as if the
                           elements had all conspired to defend him. (Theodoret) --- This most pompous description (Calmet) alludes to the wonders wrought
                           at Sinai, and the terrors which would happen at the death and resurrection of Christ, and at his last coming. Some moderns
                           think that the overthrow of the Babylonians, and other enemies of God's people, are also denoted. The sinner, touched by divine
                           grace, implores mercy, and feels the remorse of conscience, the ropes or <i>sorrows of hell,</i> and a dread of God's just
                           judgments hanging over him. (Berthier) --- These cause the most haughty and obstinate to tremble. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           The chosen people rejected Christ, (Calmet) while the nations were converted. The reprobation of the former was prefigured

                           yet they fall away. Thus we often see priests outdone in piety by simple laics. (Berthier) --- David continues in the comparison
                           of a tree which bears no fruit; (Calmet) thus <i>lying,</i> as it were, and frustrating the just expectations of the owner.
                           Subjects do the like, when they revolt; (Isaias xxx. 9.) and thus deserve the title of <i>strange.</i> Protestants, "the strangers
                           shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places;" (St. Jerome) "shall flow away, and be contracted in their straits;"
                           while I shall be at large, ver. 37. The last verb <i>gachregu,</i> (Haydock) occurs no where else. It may signify "shall be

                           David was too well informed to delight in sentiments of revenge, 3 Kings iii. 11. Jesus Christ takes vengeance on his enemies,
                           but this is done without passion. The love of justice is his only motive. David approves of this conduct. (Calmet) --- <i>Enraged

                                    Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: and he said: [2 <i>Kings</i> xxii.]</p>
                                    <p>2 I will love thee, O Lord, my strength:</p>

                                    <p>My protector, and the horn of my salvation, and my support.</p>
                                    <p>4 Praising, I will call upon the Lord: and I shall be saved from my enemies.</p>
                                    <p>5 The sorrows of death surrounded me: and the torrents of iniquity troubled me.</p>
                                    <p>6 The sorrows of hell encompassed me: and the snares of death prevented me.</p>
                                    <p>7 In my affliction I called upon the Lord, and I cried to my God:</p>
                                    <p>And he heard my voice from his holy temple: and my cry before him came into his ears.</p>
                                    <p>8 The earth shook and trembled: the foundations of the mountains were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with
                                    them.</p>
                                    <p>9 There went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed from his face: coals were kindled by it.</p>
                                    <p>10 He bowed the heavens, and came down, and darkness <i>was </i>under his feet.</p>
                                    <p>11 And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; he flew upon the wings of the winds.</p>
                                    <p>12 And he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about him: dark waters in the clouds of the air.</p>
                                    <p>13 At the brightness <i>that was</i> before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire.</p>
                                    <p>14 And the Lord thundered from heaven, and the Highest gave his voice: hail and coals of fire.</p>
                                    <p>15 And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: he multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.</p>
                                    <p>16 Then the fountains of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were discovered:</p>
                                    <p>At thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the spirit of thy wrath.</p>
                                    <p>17 He sent from on high, and took me: and received me out of many waters.</p>
                                    <p>18 He delivered me from my strongest enemies, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
                                    <p>19 They prevented me in the day of my affliction: and the Lord became my protector.</p>
                                    <p>20 And he brought me forth into a large place: he saved me, because he was well pleased with me.</p>
                                    <p>21 And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; and will repay me according to the cleanness of my hands:</p>
                                    <p>22 Because I have kept the ways of the Lord; and have not done wickedly against my God.</p>
                                    <p>23 For all his judgments are in my sight: and his justices I have not put away from me.</p>
                                    <p>24 And I shall be spotless with him: and shall keep myself from my iniquity.</p>
                                    <p>25 And the Lord will reward me according to my justice: and according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.</p>
                                    <p>26 With the holy thou wilt be holy; and with the innocent man thou wilt be innocent:</p>
                                    <p>27 And with the elect thou wilt be elect: and with the perverse thou wilt be perverted.</p>
                                    <p>28 For thou wilt save the humble people; but wilt bring down the eyes of the proud.</p>
                                    <p>29 For thou lightest my lamp, O Lord: O my God, enlighten my darkness.</p>
                                    <p>30 For by thee I shall be delivered from temptation; and through my God I shall go over a wall.</p>
                                    <p>31 As for my God, his way is undefiled: the words of the Lord are fire-tried: he is the protector of all that trust in
                                    him.</p>
                                    <p>32 For who <i>is </i>God but the Lord? or who <i>is </i>God but our God?</p>

                                    <p>36 And thou hast given me the protection of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath held me up:</p>
                                    <p>And thy discipline hath corrected me unto the end: and thy discipline, the same shall teach me.</p>
                                    <p>37 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; and my feet are not weakened.</p>
                                    <p>38 I will pursue after my enemies, and overtake them: and I will not turn again till they are consumed.</p>
                                    <p>39 I will break them, and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet.</p>
                                    <p>40 And thou hast girded me with strength unto battle; and hast subdued under me them that rose up against me.</p>
                                    <p>41 And thou hast made my enemies <i>turn their</i> back upon me, and hast destroyed them that hated me.</p>
                                    <p>42 They cried, but there was none to save them, to the Lord: but he heard them not.</p>
                                    <p>43 And I shall beat them as small as the dust before the wind; I shall bring them to nought, like the dirt in the streets.</p>
                                    <p>44 Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the people; thou wilt make me head of the Gentiles.</p>
                                    <p>45 A people which I knew not, hath served me: at the hearing of the ear they have obeyed me.</p>
                                    <p>46 The children that are strangers have lied to me, strange children have faded away, and have halted from their paths.</p>
                                    <p>47 The Lord liveth, and blessed be my God, and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</p>
                                    <p>48 O God, who avengest me, and subduest the people under me, my deliverer from my enraged enemies.</p>
                                    <p>49 *And thou wilt lift me up above them that rise up against me: from the unjust man thou wilt deliver me.</p>
                                    <p>50 *Therefore will I give glory to thee, O Lord, among the nations, and I will sing a psalm to thy name.</p>
