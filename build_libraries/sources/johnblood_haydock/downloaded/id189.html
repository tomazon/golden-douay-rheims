                           and so it is understood by St. Chrysostom who gives these two expositions; first, that he was truly and literally in the middle
                           of the sea. Secondly, that he was floating or swimming in the sea after shipwreck, which seems the more common interpretation.
                           (Witham) --- St. Paul could have avoided that disgrace, as a Roman. See Acts xxiii.; but in Acts xvi. he refused to claim
                           his privilege, that he might have an opportunity of converting the guard of the prison. (Pastorini)</FONT></P><B>
