                           Matthew: and so they are in the Protestant Testament. Yet St. Augustine in his Enchiridion, (chap. i. tom. 6, p. 240,) says
                           there were read seven petitions in St. Matthew and only five in St. Luke. We may also take notice, that though in the Greek
                           copies here in St. Luke are all seven petitions of the Lord's prayer, yet the doxology, <I>for thine is the kingdom,</I> &amp;c.
                           is omitted in all Greek copies, and by the Protestants; which is a new argument and proof, that the said doxology is an addition

                           does not teach us to pray for afflictions of the body, but always enjoins us to pray, that we may not enter into temptation.

                           in prayer. A friend comes to borrow of another friend at an unseasonable hour; his request is refused; he insists, and obtains,
                           by his perseverance, what he could not have gained without it. Thus also the Almighty wishes to be importuned; he wishes us
                           to pray with zeal and perseverance. This is the model we ought to follow. (Calmet) --- God would not exhort us so earnestly
                           to pray, unless he was ready to grant our petitions. Let us blush at our sloth: he is more ready to give than we are to receive.

                           Ambrose) --- For as long as they were in Egypt, they lived after the manners of the Egyptians, and were the habitation of
                           the unclean spirit; but it was expelled from them, when they slew the paschal lamb in figure of Christ, and escaped destruction
                           by sprinkling themselves with its blood. (St. Cyril in St. Thomas Aquinas) --- But the evil spirit returned to his former
                           habitation, the Jews, because he saw them devoid of virtue, barren, and open for his reception. And their latter state is
                           worse than their former; for more wicked demons possessed the breasts of the Jews than before. Then they raged against the
                           prophets only; but now they persecute the Lord himself of the prophets: therefore have they suffered much greater extremities

                           could he deny, as Calvin impiously maintained, that his mother was blessed? By these words, he only wishes to tell his auditors

                           it; but by the Greek, the sense is, <I>give alms of what you have,</I> i.e. of your goods, according to your abilities; and
                           as Tobias said to his son, <I>If thou hast much, give much; if little, give a little willingly.</I> (Tobias iv. 9.) --- <I>All
                           things are clean unto you.</I> Not that alms without other pious dispositions, will suffice to your salvation; but that other
                           necessary virtues will be given you, by the mercies of God. (Witham) --- These are the means I propose to you to gain that
                           interior purity I am speaking of. But will alms suffice to expiate all sorts of crimes? Is it enough for the murderer, the
                           homicide, &amp;c. to give alms? Undoubtedly not. Our Saviour only compares alms-deeds with the exterior washing which the
                           Pharisees affected. As if he had said, "It is not by the washing in common water that you will take out the stains of your
                           souls, but by the works of charity. Charity will be more efficacious to cleanse you than all the waters of the rivers and
                           of the sea." Or, according to Euthymius, if you wish to cleanse yourselves truly, bring forth worthy fruits of penance, give
                           up ill acquired possessions; and as for the rest, redeem you sins by alms. Thus shall all things be made clean to you, as
                           well within as without the vase. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>
