                           his soul for money. (Witham) --- This truth is verified and illustrated by the example of Judas, in the gospel; of Ananias
                           and Saphira, in the Acts; of Demas, mentioned by St. Paul in his second epistle to Timothy; and many others, who have made
                           shipwreck of their faith through eagerness to gain riches. Whoever seeks visible and terrestrial goods with great avidity,
                           cannot be supposed to retain much faith in things that are celestial and invisible. He quits a future real and substantial

                           the particulars. (Witham) --- Timothy had made profession of his faith at his baptism, at his ordination, and during the whole
                           course of a life which, through many labours and persecutions, had been dedicated entirely to promote the faith. (St. Thomas

                           Timothy, keep that which is committed</I>[11]<I> to thy trust.</I> He does not mean his charge of bishop, nor the graces of
                           God, but the true and sound doctrine delivered to him either by writing or word of mouth, according to the common interpretation.
                           See St. Chrysostom, Vincentius Lirinensis, Commonitorii, chap. xvii. This is confirmed by the following words, <I>avoiding
                           the profane novelties</I>[12] <I>of words:</I> (in the Greek empty, vain, babbling). The apostle here condemns new words,
                           which change the doctrine; but sometimes to express the ancient doctrine, new words may be found necessary, as those of trinity,
                           incarnation, consubstantiality, transubstantiation, &amp;c. as St. Athanasius, St. Augustine, and others observed. See 2 Timothy
                           i. 14. --- <I>Oppositions of knowledge falsely so</I>[13] <I>called.</I> St. Chrysostom understands in particular the errors
                           of the Gnostics, so called from the same Greek word, who were the successors of Simon Magus. But they perhaps not having the
                           name when St. Paul wrote, we may rather understand heretics in general, who all pretend to an uncommon knowledge in Scriptures,
                           when they follow their own private judgment, and so <I>fall</I> from the faith. (Witham) --- Keep the deposit, viz. <I>of
                           faith,</I> which has been committed to thee. Throughout this whole epistle the apostle beseeches Timothy, in the most earnest
                           manner, as a guardian of the faith, to preserve it without change. He every where condemns sects, heresies, and changes in
                           faith. It would be well for the modern religionists, to inform us and themselves, why St. Paul is so particular in insisting
                           upon union of faith, under pain of damnation, if it was the intention of Christ that men <I>should</I> differ on questions
                           of religion. Let them tell us what St. Paul means, or else say plainly that they differ from the apostle's religion, and have
                           formed theirs upon a more liberal scale. (Haydock)</FONT></P>
