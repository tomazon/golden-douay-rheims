                           <i>David.</i> Jesus Christ, (St. Hilary, &amp;c.) or the pious king David, when he intended to build the temple. Solomon adopts
                           some of the verses at his dedication, (ver. 8., and 2 Paralipomenon vi. 41.; Haydock) and some have attributed the psalm to
                           him, to the captives, or to some prophet in the time of the Machabees, though the prophets then, in fact, appeared no longer.
                           (Berthier) See Psalm xliii., lxxiii., lxxvi., lxxxviii., and xcviii. --- The Jews allow, that some verses regard the Messias,
                           of whom the whole may be explained in a spiritual, (Calmet) or even in the second literal sense. (Berthier) --- It is usual
                           for David, Moses, &amp;c., to speak of themselves in the third person. (Worthington) --- <i>Meekness.</i> Hebrew also, "humility,"
                           (Calmet) or "affliction," (St. Jerome) as the prophet might have all this in view. David gave abundant proofs of his humility
                           (2 Kings vii. 2, 13.; Berthier) and moderation, and was greatly afflicted all his life. (Haydock) --- <i>Blessed are the meek,</i>
                           Matthew v. Christ has set before us his own example.</font></p><b>

                           <i>Jacob.</i> Probably after he had removed the ark to Sion. (Berthier) --- What is omitted in one place, is thus explained
                           elsewhere. (Calmet) --- David had a most earnest desire to build the temple; and though the honour was reserved for his son,
                           he prepared the materials. (Worthington) --- He acknowledges that without God, he cannot perform his vow. (Berthier) --- We
                           have engaged to be the temples of God. (St. Augustine)</font></p><b>

                           of God's justice, if he proves faithless. (Calmet) --- He vows to take no rest, till he might, if it so pleased God, find
                           a place to build a temple. (Worthington) --- This he discovered; yet was not permitted to execute his pious designs. How does
                           his fervour confound our neglect of salvation! (Haydock) --- Self-love shuts the door of our heart against Christ. (St. Augustine)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Temples.</i> This seems to have been in the copies of Septuagint and Theodotion. It is not correct to say that the former
                           added it by inspiration, as they were only interpreters. (Berthier) --- It was marked as an addition in the Hexapla. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Heard of it in Ephrata.</i> When I was young, and lived in Bethlehem, otherwise called Ephrata, I heard of God's tabernacle
                           and ark, and had a devout desire of seeking it; and accordingly I found it, at Cariathiarim, the city of the woods: where
                           it was, till it was removed to Jerusalem. See 1 Paralipomenon xiii. (Challoner) --- Or it was revealed to David, that the
                           temple should be built in that part of Jerusalem, which looked towards Bethlehem, and is surrounded with woods. All the plan
                           was laid before him, 1 Paralipomenon xxviii. (Worthington) --- But it is not probable that Jerusalem should be thus described,
                           and there is no proof that the threshing-floor of Ornan was woody. It seems rather, that the psalmist alludes to the ark,
                           first at Silo, secondly in the country of Ephraim, or the Ephratheans, (Psalm lxxvii. 60, 67., and Judges xii. 5.) for 328
                           years, and afterwards at Cariathiarim, for other 70. The captives may also recount its different stations, and pray that it
                           may be restored; though it seems never to have been placed in the second temple. --- <i>It,</i> (<i>eam</i>) the tabernacle,
                           which in Hebrew is feminine. (Calmet) --- Yet as the text has <i>tabernacles,</i> or "dwellings," <i>mishcanoth,</i> (ver.
                           5.) and as the Mosaical tabernacle was kept at Silo or Gabaon, and was not with the ark at Cariathiarim, we may perhaps suppose,
                           that the psalmist alludes to the ark, (Haydock) or to the thing indefinitely, (Berthier) where the glory of the Lord was displayed.
                           St. Jerome and Houbigant have "him," the God of Jacob. (Haydock) --- The Fathers explain it of Jesus Christ, (Theodoret) who
                           was born at Bethlehem, (Worthington) and was prefigured by the temple, (Calmet) styled "the fields of wood." Hebrew <i>sede
                           yahar,</i> to intimate the great extend and quantity of wood used in it; though (Haydock) Cariathiarim, "the city of the woods,"
                           may be meant. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           with the ark where thou sanctifiest thy people. He contemplates a higher mystery, the coming of the Messias, and his glorious
                           resurrection. (Worthington) --- The same words were repeated, when the ark was removed in the desert, and by Solomon, as they
                           might be also by the captives. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           but he speaks thus to testify their free-will, and his desire to preserve the temporal throne of David, at least till the
                           coming of the Messias, if the Jews had proven faithful. (Berthier)</font></p><b>
