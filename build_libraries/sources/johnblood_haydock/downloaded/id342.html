                           <P><STRONG>Notes &amp; Commentary:</STRONG></P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 1.</STRONG> <I>Fear not.</I> He might naturally be under some apprehensions, lest the four kings should attempt
                           to be revenged upon him. --- <I>Reward,</I> since thou hast so generously despised earthly riches. (Haydock) --- Abram was
                           not asleep, but saw a vision of exterior objects, ver. 5.</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 2.</STRONG> <I>I shall go.</I> To what purpose should I heap up riches, since I have no son to inherit them?
                           Abram knew that God had promised him a numerous posterity; but he was not apprized how this was to be verified, and whether
                           he was to adopt some other for his son and heir. Therefore, he asks modestly, how he ought to understand the promise. ---
                           <I>And the son,</I> &amp;c. Hebrew is differently rendered, "and the steward of my house, this Eliezer of Damascus." We know
                           not whether Eliezer or Damascus be the proper name. The Septuagint have "the son of Mesech, my handmaid, this Eliezer of Damascus."
                           Most people suppose, that Damascus was the son of Eliezer, the steward. The sentence is left unfinished, and must be supplied
                           from the following verse, <I>shall be my heir.</I> The son of the steward, <I>filius procurationis,</I> may mean the steward
                           himself, as the son of perdition denotes the person lost. (Calmet)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 6.</STRONG> <I>Reputed</I> by God, who cannot judge wrong; so that Abram increased in justice by this act
                           of faith, believing that his wife, now advanced in years, would have a child; from whom others should spring, more numerous
                           than the stars of heaven. (Haydock) --- This faith was accompanied and followed by many other acts of virtue, St. James ii.
                           22. (Worthington)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 8.</STRONG> <I>Whereby,</I> &amp;c. Thus the blessed Virgin Mary asked, how shall this be done? Luke i. 34,
                           without the smallest degree of unbelief. Abram wished to know, by what signs he should be declared the lawful owner of the
                           land. (Haydock)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 9.</STRONG> <I>Three years,</I> when these animals have obtained a perfect age.</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 12.</STRONG> <I>A deep sleep,</I> or ecstasy, like that of Adam, chap. ii. 21, wherein God revealed to him
                           the oppression of his posterity in Egypt, which filled him with such <I>horror</I> (Menochius) as we experience when something
                           frightful comes upon us suddenly in the dark. This <I>darkness</I> represented the dismal situation of Joseph, confined in
                           a dungeon; and of the Hebrews condemned to hard labour, in making bricks, and obliged to hide their male children, for fear
                           of their being discovered, and slain. Before these unhappy days commenced, the posterity of Abram were exposed to great oppression
                           among the Chanaanites, nor could they in any sense be said to possess the land of promise, for above 400 years after this
                           prophetic sleep. (Haydock)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 13.</STRONG> <I>Strangers, and under bondage,</I> &amp;c. This prediction may be dated from the persecution
                           of Isaac by Ismael, in the year of the world&nbsp;2112, till the Jews left Egypt, 2513. In Exodus xii., and St. Paul, 430
                           years are mentioned; but they probably began when Abram went first into Egypt, 2084. Nicholas Abram and Tournemine say, the
                           Hebrews remained in Egypt full 430 years, from the captivity of Joseph; and reject the addition of the Septuagint which adds,
                           "they and their fathers dwelt in Egypt, and in Chanaan." On these points, we may expect to find chronologists at variance.</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 14.</STRONG> <I>Judge</I> and punish the Egyptians, overwhelming them in the Red sea, &amp;c. (Haydock)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 16.</STRONG> <I>Fourth,</I> &amp;c. after the 400 years are finished; during which period of time, God was
                           pleased to bear with those wicked nations; whose iniquity chiefly consisted in idolatry, oppression of the poor and strangers,
                           forbidden marriages of kindred, and abominable lusts. (Leviticus xviii; Deuteronomy vi. and xii.) (Menochius)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 17. </STRONG><I>A lamp,</I> or symbol of the Divinity, passing, as Abram also did, between the divided beasts,
                           to ratify the covenant. See Jeremias xxxiv. 18.</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 18.</STRONG> <I>Of Egypt,</I> a branch of the Nile, not far from Pelusium. This was to be the southern limit,
                           and the Euphrates the northern; the two other boundaries are given, Numbers xxxiv. --- Perhaps Solomon's empire extended so
                           far. At least, the Jews would have enjoyed these territories, if they had been faithful. (Menochius)</P>
                           <P><STRONG>Ver. 19.</STRONG> <I>Cineans,</I> in Arabia, of which nation was Jethro. They were permitted to dwell in the tribe
                           of Juda, and served the Hebrews. --- <I>Cenezites,</I> who probably inhabited the mountains of Juda. --- <I>Cedmonites,</I>
                           or <I>eastern</I> people, as their name shews. Cadmus was of this nation, of the race of the Heveans, dwelling in the environs
                           of mount Hermon, whence his wife was called Hermione. He was, perhaps, one of those who fled at the approach of Josue; and
                           was said to have sowed dragons' teeth, to people his city of Thebes in Beotia, from an allusion to the name of the Hevites,
                           which signifies serpents. (Calmet) --- The eleven nations here mentioned were not all subdued; on account of the sins of the
                           Hebrews. (Menochius)</P></FONT></FONT>
