                           <i>Uncle of Abimelech,</i> i.e., Half-brother to Gedeon, as being born of the same mother, but by a different father, and
                           of a different tribe. (Challoner) --- The wife of Joas might have been married to a person of the tribe of Issachar, by whom
                           she had Phua, who was half-brother of Gedeon. (Haydock) --- Thola was cousin-german of Abimelech. (St. Augustine, q. xlvii.,
                           &amp;c.) The Israelites elected Thola for their judge, (Abulensis) out of respect to Gedeon, (Cornelius a Lapide) that he
                           might put an end to the commotions which had been excited by the tyrant. (Menochius) -- Joatham might be passed over on account
                           of his youth. The Septuagint and Chaldean have "Thola, the son of Phua, the son of his uncle by the father's side," which
                           may be true, if the brother of Gedeon adopted him; or this <i>uncle</i> might refer to Abimelech. The uncertainty arises from
                           the Hebrew <i>Dodo,</i> which may be taken as a proper name. "Phua, the son of Dodo;" (Pagnin; Protestants, &amp;c.; Haydock)
                           or as denoting a relation, the paternal uncle of Abimelech, or of Thola, (Bonfrere, &amp;c.; Calmet) or simply "his kinsman."
                           The Hebrew, Septuagint, &amp;c., assert that Thola "arose to defend <i>or</i> to save Israel." He seems to have kept all quiet
                           during the 23 years of his administration. --- <i>Samir.</i> Septuagint Alexandrian reads "Samaria;" but the city was not
                           built till the reign of Amri. There was a city on a mountain, (Haydock) called Samir, in the tribe of Juda, (Josue xv. 48,)
                           different from this. (Menochius) --- People were at liberty to dwell where they pleased, out of their own tribe. (Calmet)
                           --- This judge was buried among the Ephraimites. (Haydock) --- But we know not the exact place where Samir stood. (Calmet)
                           --- There seems, however, to be no inconvenience in allowing that there was a town in the vicinity of Sichem, long before
                           Amri made Samaria the capital of his kingdom; (see 3 Kings xiii. 22., and xvi. 24,) and here Thola might reside. He was probably
                           the eldest, or of the second branch, of Issachar, (Numbers xxvi. 23, ) of great nobility and virtue, and the 10th judge of
                           Israel.</font></p><b>

                           <i>Years.</i> S. Severus says 22, making the reign of Jair of equal length. <i>Cum æque viginti &amp; duos annos principatum
                           obtinuisset.</i> But this is contrary to all the best chronologers. The fidelity of the Israelites seems to have been of no
                           longer continuance at this period than usual, as we find that they relapsed into idolatry again, at least after the death
                           of Jair, within 45 years after they had been scourged by the tyrant Abimelech, ver. 6. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Havoth Jair.</i> This name was now confirmed to these towns, which they had formerly received from another Jair, Numbers
                           xxxii. 41. (Challoner) --- Sixty are there specified, and only 30 here, which might either be the same, or different from
                           those villages to which the former Jair had left his name. Grotius thinks that judge Jair was the son of Segub, who left 23
                           cities to him. These, with seven belonging to his grandfather, Hesron, make up the number here specified, 1 Paralipomenon
                           ii. 22. --- The Hebrew does not say that these 30 cities were called after the judge: "they had 30 cities, which are called
                           <i>Havoth Jair,</i>" &amp;c. (Calmet) --- Some copies of the Septuagint add "two" to the number of sons, asses, and cities,
                           as if there had been 32 of each. In other respects they agree with the original. It was formerly a mark of distinction to
                           ride on fair asses, chap. v. 10. (Haydock) --- St. Jerome thinks that horses were prohibited, as they were in Egypt, without
                           the king's leave. But we nowhere find this law recorded , (Calmet) and it is not universally true that it existed. (Menochius)
                           (Hieropolit. iii. 15.) --- Some have inferred from Jair's children having 30 cities, that he exercised a sovereign authority
                           over Israel: but he might only give his children the authority of magistrates in them, as Samuel did, 1 Kings viii. (Estius)
                           --- We know not by what means Jair was raised to the chief command, nor what he did for the benefit of the people. He is supposed
                           to be the same who is called <i>Bedan,</i> 1 Kings xii. 11. Serarius; Usher, &amp;c.); though others think that Bedan is a
                           title of Samson. He was of the tribe of Manasses in Galaad. Having kept the people under due restraint during his administration,
                           they burst forth, like a torrent, at his death, and, on all sides, abandoned themselves to a multiplicity of idols, so that
                           God made some difficulty in restoring them again to favour. (Haydock) --- Cornelius a Lapide thinks that they had begun to
                           relapse 18 years before the death of Jair, and were, consequently, chastised by the Ammonites. Serarius is of a contrary opinion,
                           though Houbigant rather inclines to the former sentiment, as it is not said that Jair gave rest to the land, nor more than
                           Samgar. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Camon</i> is placed in Galaad by Adrichomius, though St. Jerome mentions another, six miles from Legion, where he supposes
                           that Jair was buried. It seems more natural to say that he was interred in his own country, on the east side of the Jordan.
                           (Bonfrere) --- It is, probably the same city as Hamon (1 Paralipomenon vi. 16,) and Hammothdor, Josue xxxi. 32. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           Amalec, in their attacks upon the Israelites. As for Chanaan, which other editions of the Septuagint retain, we know that
                           they were domestic enemies, like thorns in the sides of Israel, Josue xxiii. 13. All the persecutions, which the Hebrews had
                           to undergo, are not particularized in this book. (Calmet) --- They were grievously tormented in Egypt, they had to contend
                           with the Amorrhites at their first entrance into the land. (Haydock) --- The Ammonites and Amalecites had assisted Eglon before,

                           probably were the auxiliaries of Jabin. (Calmet) --- But the Chanaanites were ready to fall upon every weak spot, living in
                           various parts of the country, (Haydock) and continually tempted the people of Israel to abandon the service of God. (Calmet)</font></p><b>
