                           that the Father is with him, plainly distinguishing the two Persons. The Father is truly the Father, and the Son truly the

                           had called and declared God to be his Father; but they had a mind to make him own it again, that they might accuse him as
                           guilty of blasphemy. --- <I>Neither me do you know, nor my Father:</I> you will not own me to have been always his Son, nor
                           him to have been always my Father, but <I>did you know me</I> to be his Son, always proceeding from him, <I>you would know

                           here Christ says, <I>If you did know me, you would know my Father also:</I> not that the Father is the Son, or the Son the
                           Father, but because the Father is like the Son. (St. Augustine) --- Here might the Arians, and all who maintain that Christ
                           is a mere creature, blush; for if he were a creature, how can any one who knows him likewise know God? Therefore is Christ

                           art thou? Jesus said to them: The beginning,</I>[3]<I> who also speak to you.</I> This text and the construction of it is
                           obscure, both in the Latin and in the Greek. St. Augustine and some of the Latin Fathers, expound it in this manner: <I>I
                           am the beginning</I> of all things, who now being made man, speak to you. But this does not seem the construction, if we consult
                           the Greek text; (where <I>the beginning</I> is not in the nominative, but in the accusative case) and therefore St. Augustine
                           having considered more attentively the Greek, thinks that something must be understood, as <I>believe me to be the beginning:</I>
                           he looks upon this to be the sense and the construction, as being connected with what was said two verses before; to wit,
                           <I>if you believe not that I am he,</I> the true Messias, <I>you shall die in your sins.</I> "That they might," says St. Augustine
                           (tract. 38, num. 11, p. 560) "know what they were to believe," he made them this answer, as if he had said: believe me to
                           be the beginning, the cause, the author of all things, who am now become man, and speak to you. Other later interpreters are
                           of opinion that <I>the beginning</I> is here a Grecism, and signifies that same as <I>at first,</I> or from the beginning.
                           The sense therefore and construction may be, I am, what I said and told you at first, and from the beginning; that is, I am
                           your Messias, the true Son of God, sent into the world, &amp;c. (Witham) --- The Pharisees, indignant at the liberty with
                           which Jesus spoke to them, demand of him in a rage, Who art thou, to speak to us in this imperious manner, to say that we
                           shall die in our sins? Jesus answered them, that he was the <I>Beginning,</I> Author, Creator, and Ruler of all things. This
                           is the more orthodox and more becoming interpretation. Or, I am, in the first place, what I have already told you; viz. (ver.
                           12.) I am the light of the world; he that followeth me, walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life. Or, it
                           may mean, I am what I have always from the beginning told you. I am the Son of God, the Messias, &amp;c. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>
