                           contains some more reasons why Christians should love one another. We are all the servants of the same God, believe the same
                           mysteries, and receive the same sacraments, whoever may be the dispenser of them. --- <I>One faith.</I> As rebellion is the
                           bane of commonwealths and kingdoms, and peace and concord the preservation of the same; so is schism, and diversity of faith
                           or fellowship in the service of God, the calamity of the Church: and peace, unity, and uniformity, the special blessing of
                           God therein. St. Cyprian, in his book on the unity of the Church, writeth thus: "One Church, for one is my dove. This unity
                           of the Church, he that holdeth not, doth he think he holdeth the faith? He that withstandeth or resisteth the Church, he that
                           resisteth Peter's chair, upon which the Church was built, doth he trust that he is in the Church?" And again, Ep. xl. "There
                           is one God, and one Christ, and one Church, and one chair, by our Lord's voice founded upon Peter. To set up another altar,
                           or to constitute another priesthood, besides the one altar and the one priesthood, is impossible. Whosever gathereth elsewhere
                           scattereth. It is adulterous, it is impious, it is sacrilegious, whatsoever is instituted by man to the breach of God's disposition.
                           Get ye far from such men: they are blind, and leaders of the blind." St. Hilary also applies this text against the Arians
                           thus: "Perilous and miserable it is that there are now among them as many faiths as wills, and as many doctrines as manners;
                           whilst modes of faith are written as men will, or as they will, so are understood. Whereas the one truth teaches there is
                           but one God, one Lord, one baptism, and also one faith: hence whilst more faiths are made, they begin by falling from that
                           which is the only faith, and end in having no faith at all." (St. Hilary, lib. ad Constantium Augustum.)</FONT></P><B>

                           his free gifts upon us; to shew, says St. Chrysostom, that it was not according to any merit of ours. The words also shew
                           that Christ is the giver and author of graces, and consequently the true God. (Witham) --- We must endeavour by all means
                           in our power to preserve this unity, especially by avoiding jealousy, or being envious of the graces which have been given

                           led captivity captive.</I>[1] St. Jerome and others expound these words of Christ's delivering the pious souls that had died
                           before his ascension, and which were detained in a place of rest which is called Limbus Patrum [i.e. Limbo of the Fathers;
                           sometimes called paradise (Luke xxiii. 43.), Abraham&#8216; bosom (Luke xvi. 22.), or prison (1 Peter iii. 19.)]. --- <I>He

                           --- <I>Wherefore he,</I> David, in Psalm lxvii., makes use of these words, in order to shew that these gifts were gratuitous,
                           and that no person had a right to complain that another had received more: after this the apostle proceeds to shew that Christ
                           even descended to the lower parts of the earth, in order to teach us humility; whence he concludes that we ought to be humble
                           and live in union with our brethren, which is the chief subject of the present chapter. (Tirinus)</FONT></P><B>

                           of the full and perfect age of Christ. Of the ancient interpreters, some expound this of what shall happen in the next world,
                           after the resurrection, when all the elect shall have bodies every way perfect; and as some conjecture, (when all who rise
                           by a happy resurrection) shall seem to be about thirty, of the stature and age of Christ when he suffered. But others, especially
                           the Greek interpreters, understand this verse of a spiritual perfection in this life, by which the members of Christ's mystical
                           body <I>meet in the unity of faith,</I> and increase in grace and virtue by imitating Christ, and following his doctrine and
                           example. And this seems more agreeable to what follows: <I>that we may not now be children, tossed to and fro by the wickedness,</I>[3]
                           <I>of men.</I> The Greek word, as St. Jerome observes, may signify by the <I>deceit</I> or fallacy of men; by <I>illusion,</I>
                           says St. Augustine. And St. Chrysostom tells us it is spoken by a metaphor, taken from those who cheat at dice, to gain all
                           to themselves, to draw men into <I>errors</I> and heresies. Such, about that time, were the disciples of Simon the magician.
                           (Witham) --- Every one must labour to become perfect in the state in which he is placed, by increasing in the knowledge and
                           love of God, which knowledge and love of God constitute the full measure of a Christian. (St. Chrysostom) --- St. Augustine
                           also admits to another interpretation of this place, but prefers the former. According to him, it may mean: that all people,
                           at the resurrection, will be raised in such a state as they would have had if they lived to the age of Christ, viz. thirty-three
                           years. (St. Thomas Aquinas) --- This text of the apostle, assuring to the one true Church a perpetual and visible succession
                           of pastors, in the ministry, successors of the apostles, warranted the holy Fathers in the early ages of the Church, as it
                           does Catholics of the present day, to try all seceders by the most famous succession of the popes or bishops of Rome. See
                           this in St. Irenæus, lib. iii. chap. 3; Tertullian, in præscript. Optatus. lib. ii. contra Parmen.; St. Augustine, contra

                           a natural body, whose perfection depends on the harmony, union, and concurrence of all the different parts; and so in the
                           Church, of which Christ is the head, some are apostles, some prophets, &amp;c. and Christ hath been pleased to give them different
                           offices, talents, and gifts, for the edifying and increase of the whole body, which is his Church, that they may no longer

                           The obscurity of this verse my be thus explained: the apostle compares the mystical body of the Church, of which Christ is
                           the head, to the natural body of man; and as the head directs different members to different operations, according to their
                           various properties, so in the Church Christ distributes to each his proper office, that being all intent upon their relative
                           duties, all may grow up in charity and become perfect. (Estius)</FONT></P><B>

                           with a zeal against their blindness and malice. --- <I>Let not the sun go down upon your anger.</I> If moved to anger, return
                           without delay to a calmness of mind and temper. (Witham) --- Be angry when reason or necessity compels you; but even then,
                           so restrain your anger that you neither offend God nor scandalize your neighbour. Moreover, lay it aside as soon as you are
                           able, so that the sun go not down upon your anger. (Jansenius)</FONT></P><B>
