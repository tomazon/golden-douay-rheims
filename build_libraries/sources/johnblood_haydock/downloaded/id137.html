                           conversion. Still were these effects to be attributed to the desire of the sacrament of baptism, without which the council
                           of Trent defines that the forgiveness of sins, and the punishment due to them, are not obtained. It likewise added a new degree

                           29.) --- It was under Claudius that the abuse of buying the freedom of Rome was introduced. At first the name of a Roman was
                           esteemed much, and bought at a great price. Now (such is the emptiness and vanity of titles) it is refused, and despised;
                           nay, it is fled from, and reckoned disgraceful. (Salvian. De Gubern. Dei, lib. v.) --- If St. Paul, on this occasion, makes
                           use of his privilege, it is not that he was unprepared, or afraid to die for Christ; but because it was lawful to use ordinary
                           means to extricate himself from difficulties, and preserve himself for future services to religion. (Denis the Carthusian)</FONT></P>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And I said: What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me: Arise,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And he said: The God of our fathers hath preordained thee that thou

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And saw him, saying unto me: Make haste, and go quickly out of Jerusalem:
                                    because they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And I said: Lord, they know *that I cast into prison, and beat in

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And as they cried out, and threw off their garments, and cast dust

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 The tribune *commanded him to be brought into the castle, and to be

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And when they had bound him with thongs, Paul saith to the centurion
                                    standing by him: Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 Which the centurion hearing, went to the tribune, and told him, saying:
                                    What art thou about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And the tribune coming, said to him: Tell me, art thou a Roman? But
                                    he said: Yes.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And the tribune answered: I obtained the freedom of this city with
                                    a great sum. And Paul said: But I was born so.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 Immediately, therefore, they that were about to torture him, departed
                                    from him. The tribune also was afraid after he understood that he was a Roman citizen, and because he had bound him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 But on the next day, wishing to know more diligently, for what cause
                                    he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the priests to come together and all the council: and bringing forth
                                    Paul, he set him before them.</font></p>
