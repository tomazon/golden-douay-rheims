                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted,</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he sent to all the

                                    that could interpret it.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 Then at length the chief butler remembering, said: I confess my sin:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 The king being angry with his servants, commanded me and the chief

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream foreboding things to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the same captain

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be so.
                                    For I was restored to my office: and he was hanged upon a gibbet.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 Forthwith at the king's command Joseph was brought out of the prison,
                                    and they shaved him: and changing his apparel brought him in to him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And he said to him: I have dreamed dreams, and there is no one that
                                    can expound them: Now I have heard that thou art very wise at interpreting them:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 Joseph answered: Without me, *God shall give Pharao a prosperous answer.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 So Pharao told what he had dreamed: Methought I stood upon the bank

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And seven kine came up out of the river, exceeding beautiful and full

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And behold, there followed these, other seven kine, so very ill-favoured

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And they devoured and consumed the former,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And yet gave no mark of their being full: but were as lean and ill-favoured
                                    as before. I awoke, <i>and then </i>fell asleep again,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn grew up upon one stalk, full

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung of the stalk:</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 Joseph answered: The king's dream is one: God hath shewn to Pharao

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after them, and the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 Which shall be fulfilled in this order.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 Now therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man, and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 That he may appoint overseers over all the countries: and gather into

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 That shall now presently ensue: and let all the corn be laid up, under

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And let it be in readiness, against the famine of seven years to come,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 The counsel pleased Pharao, and all his servants.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 And he said to them: Can we find such another man, that is full of

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 *Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold, I have appointed thee over

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his hand:
                                    and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about his neck.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier proclaiming

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao: without thy commandment

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">45 And he turned his name, and called him in the Egyptian tongue the

                                    to the land of Egypt.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">46 (Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharao), and

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">47 And the fruitfulness of the seven years came: and the corm being bound
                                    up into sheaves, was gathered together into the barns of Egypt.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">48 And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">49 And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it was equal to the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">50 *And before the famine came, Joseph had two sons born: whom Aseneth,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">51 And he called the name of the first-born Manasses, saying: God hath

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">52 And he named the second Ephraim, saying: God hath made me to grow

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">53 Now when the seven years of the plenty that had been in Egypt were

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">55 And when there also they began to be famished, the people cried to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">57 And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy food, and to seek some relief
