                           pardon a poor fugitive slave, but I will not; I merely as a poor humble supplicant, forgetting all the dignity due to my apostleship,
                           my grey hairs, or my chains, beseech thee to pardon him. Nor can I for a moment doubt of obtaining my request, when I consider

                           as shew how much St. Paul has this affair at heart, and that he will look upon the favour he asks as done to himself. It is,
                           that thou wilt pardon Onesimus, whom I look upon and love as <I>my son,</I> and a most dear son, <I>whom I have begotten,</I>
                           a prisoner, and <I>in my chains.</I> (Witham) --- How great is the ingenuity shewn by St. Paul in this epistle, in obtaining
                           for Onesimus the pardon of his master, Philemon. Having in the preceding verse endeavoured by every argument which a real
                           tenderness and compassion could inspire, and making use of every expression that could conciliate the favour of Philemon,
                           to obtain his charitable request, he in this verse for the first time dares mention <I>Onesimus</I> by name; a name which
                           he was sensible must sound harsh in the ears of one who had received an injury from him. See how he endeavours to prevent
                           so unhappy an effect, by adding to the name every epithet that could any way tend to soften all feelings of asperity, and
                           excite compassion and pity. <I>I beseech thee then for my son, whom I have begotten, and that in my chains.</I> (Calmet) ---
                           The pardon I crave is not for your <I>slave,</I> but for my <I>son.</I> If in all antiquity there be any thing in the persuasive
                           kind of eloquence truly admirable, it is this short epistle in which there are contained almost as many arguments as words.</FONT></P><B>

                           him with me: but I have sent him back, thou being his master, nor would I do any thing in regard of thy servant, without thy
                           advice and consent, that if thou thinkest it fitting to send him back again to me, and to give him his freedom, it may be
                           without any constraint upon thee, without any necessity, thy voluntary and charitable act and deed. (Witham) --- St. Paul
                           here makes an allusion to the word <I>Onesimus,</I> signifying <I>useful</I> in the Greek. He was before unprofitable, he
                           says, to thee, contrary to the import of his name; but now he is truly an Onesimus, or <I>useful,</I> both to you and to me;
                           to you indeed, by his conversion, and the resolution he now makes to serve you faithfully the remainder of his life; to me
                           also, by the services he renders me in my chains. (Calmet) --- St. Jerome observes that some hypercritics pretended that this
                           subject was not deserving the solicitude of an apostle, and on that account questioned its author; but this reasoning is unworthy
                           of those who adore a God who did not refuse to die for rebellious and impious slaves. It shews pastors how solicitous they
                           should always be for the salvation of the meanest of their flock; yes, though they may appear obdurate, and dead and buried
                           in the pit of sin.</FONT></P><B>
