                           The Fathers, St. Augustine, (q. 56,) &amp;c., explain this of the Christian Church, rather than of the Synagogue. (Theodoret)
                           --- <I>Man of God.</I> A title given to a prophet, 1 Kings ii. 27., and ix. 6. The prophets often speak of things to come,
                           as if they were past, as we have seen in the conduct of Balaam, Numbers xxiv. 3. Moses here delivers his last testament, and
                           speaks as one no longer in the world, so that there is no reason to affirm that this chapter has been added by another hand;
                           (Calmet) though Kennicott thinks it probable. He suggests, that the first verses of this blessing have been corrupted in the
                           Hebrew and should be translated: <B>2. </B>He, Jehovah, came from Sinai, and he arose upon them from Seir; (Judges v. 4.)
                           <B>3. </B>He shone forth from Mount Pharan, and he came from Meriba-Cadesh. (Numbers xx. 1. 13.) From his right hand a fire
                           shone forth upon them. <B>4. </B>Truly he loved the people, and he blessed all his saints. <B>5.</B> For they fell down at
                           his feet, and they received of his words. <B>6.</B> He commanded us a law, the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. <B>7.</B>
                           And He became king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were assembled, together with the tribes of Israel. See (Dis.
                           i. p. 423,) the arguments which he produces in favour of this version. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           Habacuc iii. 3, mentions this apparition. See also Psalm lxvii. 9. --- <I>Saints.</I> God was accompanied by legions of angels,
                           when he delivered the law to the Israelites, who are styled a nation of saints, Numbers xvi. 3. Septuagint, "he hastened from
                           Mount Pharan, with ten thousands to Cades. At his right hand are his angels attending." (Haydock) --- <I>Kodesh</I> does not
                           mean <I>saints,</I> but holiness, or the city of Cades; and the preceding word, which Protestants translate, <I>with ten thousands,</I>
                           more probably refers to another title of the city, as it is specified Meriba-Cadesh, chap. xxxii. 51., and Ezechiel xlviii.
                           28. (Kennicott) --- <I>Law.</I> Chaldean, "from the midst of the fire he has given us a law, written with his own hand." We
                           may translate, "He hath shone from Mount Pharan, and multitudes accompanied him. The Holy One, who hath in his hand fire and
                           the law." See Isaias vi. 3. God conducted his people, like a victorious general, through the wilderness, frequently appearing
                           to them to strike terror into the rebellious. (Calmet) --- When he first descended upon Sinai, his glory shone on Pharan and
                           Seir, as it were in its progress thither. (Menochius) --- The <I>law</I> is styled <I>fiery,</I> not only because it was given
                           from the midst of flames, but also because it was to be put in execution with the utmost rigour. (Haydock) --- But <I>doth</I>
                           is Chaldean, and no where else used for the <I>law</I> in the books written before the captivity, nor is it acknowledged by
                           the Septuagint, Syriac, &amp;c. Perhaps it was originally <I>aur,</I> as it is in the Samaritan version, "<I>shone forth</I>,"
                           conformably to a similar passage, Habacuc iii. 4. "His brightness was as the sun, <I>horns,</I> or rather splendours (issuing
                           forth) from his hand," &amp;c. (Kennicott)</FONT></P><B>

                           (<I>populos</I>.) God loves and watches over all, but particularly (Calmet) over the nation which he has chosen. (Chaldean)
                           See Wisdom iii. 1., and Isaias xlix. 16. --- <I>Doctrine.</I> It was formerly the custom for disciples to sit at their master's
                           feet, (Acts xxii. 3,) as it is still in the eastern countries. (Bellon. iii. 12.) Septuagint, "and these are under thee;"
                           (Haydock) subject to thy orders. (Calmet) --- Hebrew is here extremely confused: "Yea, he loved the people; all his saints
                           <I>are</I> in thy hand, and they eat down at thy feet; <I>every one</I> shall receive of thy words." Moses here addresses
                           the Lord. How could he say therefore, <I>all his,</I> &amp;c.? whose <I>saints,</I> and in whose hand? The Vulgate and Chaldean
                           have not the same difficulty, as they read, <I>in his hand, bidu.</I> But the Syriac has, "and he blessed all his saints."
                           <I>Boroc</I> is not very unlike the present Hebrew <I>bidoc,</I> (Kennicott) <I>r</I> and <I>d</I> being frequently mistaken
                           for each other, and <I>i</I> as often neglected by the Hebrew copyists. (Haydock) --- The Samaritan version confirms this
                           alteration; and the text also has the <I>v, and,</I> at the beginning, which makes the whole to be clearly connected, particularly
                           if we allow that <I>c,</I> which stands for <I>thy,</I> has been substituted for <I>v, his,</I> in the following words, <I>thy
                           feet</I> and <I>thy words,</I> which ought to be <I>his,</I> as all the context speaks of God in the third person. This is
                           agreeable to the Vulgate and to the Septuagint also, in the last instance. In the former, the Hebrew is printed <I>thy foot,</I>
                           though the Samaritan and several manuscripts read <I>thy feet.</I> Instead of <I>yissa,</I> "he shall receive," (Haydock)
                           the plural ought to be substituted, <I>v</I> being omitted both at the beginning and end, as it is in the name of Benaihu,
                           1 Paralipomenon xi. 22. See 2 Kings xxiii. 20. The Samaritan, Syriac, and Arabic, read <I>and they received,</I> (Kennicott)
                           and the Vulgate, <I>they shall receive.</I> The Septuagint seem to refer this to Moses, "And Moses received from his words,
                           the law which he enjoined to us." (Haydock) --- That <I>Moses</I> should speak of himself, in this manner, seems very unaccountable,
                           and therefore a word may perhaps have crept in, on account of its resemblance with the following term, <I>Mursse.</I> If it
                           has not, Moses must have assumed the title of <I>king,</I> (ver. 5,) which he seems nevertheless to have disclaimed; (chap.
                           xvii. 14,) and there was none in Israel before Saul, 1 Kings viii. 7. (Kennicott) --- We may, however, suppose that he puts
                           these words in the mouths of the people, who would repeat this blessing after he was dead, and mention with gratitude, how
                           Moses had delivered to them so excellent a law, and administered the affairs of state with all the power and dignity of a
                           king. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           He expresses himself as if the people were speaking. The change of persons is very frequent in this discourse. --- <I>Inheritance.</I>

                           "And there shall be over the beloved a ruler," as (Haydock) some understand this of Moses, others of Saul, though it most
                           probably refers to God himself, who gave the law, and was acknowledged, in the most solemn manner, for the king of <I>Israel.</I>

                           This is conformable to the prophecy of Jacob, who deprived Ruben of his birth-right, on account of incest. He is even treated
                           with indulgence, in being permitted to form one of the tribes. Yet some copies of the Septuagint, Syriac, (Theodoret q. 42,)
                           and many interpreters, take this in a quite&nbsp;contrary sense, "let him be numerous, or not few;" the negation being supplied
                           from the former part of the verse, which is not unusual in Hebrew. See Genesis ii. 6., Psalm ix. 19., and Proverbs xxxi. 1,
                           &amp;c. The tribe of Ruben was in effect more numerous than those of Gad, Joseph, or Benjamin. Simeon receives no blessing,
                           probably on account of the crimes for which so many of that tribe were exterminated, (Numbers i. 23., and xxvi. 14.; Calmet,)
                           and particularly Zambri, one of the chief princes, Numbers xxv. (Worthington) --- But Grabe's Septuagint applies to Simeon
                           what the rest attribute to Ruben. "And let Simeon be many in number." No solid reason can be given why he should be passed
                           over entirely, as, notwithstanding the infidelity of some of his children, and his own cruelty in not endeavouring to rescue
                           Joseph, &amp;c., he was to form a tribe among his brethren. (Haydock) --- Some, therefore, imagine that he was to share in

                           was made. Josephus (Jewish Wars ii. 17,) says, that near the tomb of Memnon, a bed of such sand is found, about 100 cubits
                           long, which, though many vessels have been filled from it, has never been exhausted. See Pliny, [Natural History?] v. 19.,

                           while the Romans contented themselves with iron. (Josephus, Jewish Wars vii. 3.) --- But this custom was not peculiar to the
                           soldiers. People of all descriptions did the like, either for ornament, or to make their sandals last longer. Empedocles wore
                           brass at the bottom of his sandals; (Laert. viii.) and as one of them was thrown out from the top of Mount Etna, it was discovered
                           that he had destroyed himself in that volcano, to make people suppose (Calmet) that he was a god, and had gone up to heaven.
                           (Haydock) --- St. Clement of Alexandria (P&#339;d. ii.) complains, that some wore such gaudy ornaments in his days. (Calmet)
                           --- This passage is interpreted in a figurative sense by some, as if Aser would trample under his feet and despise the instruments
                           of war, (Jansenius) and would turn those metals to the purposes of agriculture. Others render the Hebrew, "Thy bars shall
                           be of iron and brass, and thy reputation (strength, repose, or sorrow,) shall endure as long as thy life; or May they," &amp;c.,
                           in the form of a wish. Moses desires that Aser may be secure against his enemies, as if he had a mind to insinuate, that this
                           tribe would be led captive among the first by Teglathphalasar, 4 Kings xv. 29. Many of the cities of this tribe were strongly
                           fortified. (Josephus) --- If we adopt <I>thy sorrow shall,</I> &amp;c., we must observe, that the neighbourhood of Ph&#339;nicians
                           exposed the people to continual incursions, (Calmet) and the king of Assyria at last came to complete their ruin. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>
