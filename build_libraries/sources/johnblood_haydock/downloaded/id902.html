                           enthusiasm which shewed that he was actuated by the divine spirit, to speak with all the authority requisite. The pagans strove
                           to imitate the true prophets, but the difference was very evident; no less than the spirit with which they were filled; the
                           former were agitated in a furious manner; the latter were composed and majestic. (Calmet)</font></p><i></i><b>

                           <i>Wall,</i> to Chamos, the idol of Moab; (Menochius) or to Moloc, to appease the wrath of the gods. Horrible blindness! The
                           pagans believed, that the most precious thing ought to be sacrificed in very imminent dangers. (Philo Biblius, following Eusebius,
                           præp. iv. 16.) --- The Ph&#339;nicians offered such victims to Saturn. Many devoted themselves to death for the safety of
                           the Roman republic; and some were ready to do so, to preserve the lives of Caligula and Nero, before they had given proof
                           of their evil dispositions. (Seutonius xiv.) --- It is thought that Sennacherib intended to treat his two sons in this manner,
                           if they had not prevented him. (Abulensis, in 4 Kings xix. 37.) --- Some imagine that Mesa sacrificed his son to the God of
                           Israel, in imitation of Abraham; (Josephus; Grotius) others, that he slew the son of the king of Edom, out of revenge. (Kimchi,
                           in Amos ii. 1.) --- The Hebrew is ambiguous. (Amama) --- But interpreters generally believe, that the heir of Mesa fell a
                           victim (Calmet) to his father's mistaken zeal, or to his desire to make the enemy retire, when they saw him reduced to such
                           a state of desperation. It had, at least, this effect. (Haydock) --- <i>Indignation,</i> at such a cruel action. (Menochius)
                           --- Septuagint, "there was great repentance" and sorrow. The text may also imply, that God was displeased at Israel for pushing
                           the king to such an extremity; or, they became an object of horror to the surrounding nations. (Calmet) --- The first explanation
                           seems the best; as the Israelites thought the king had been sufficiently punished, and therefore retired. They had no reason
                           to suspect that he would have given way to such madness, nor were they to blame for it. (Haydock)</font></p><font size="2"
