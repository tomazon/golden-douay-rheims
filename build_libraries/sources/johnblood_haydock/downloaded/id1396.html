                           prophet, ver. 12 to chap. xliv. 5., though what follows immediately seems to belong to the Lord, (Calmet) in whose name he
                           speaks. --- <i>Name.</i> God hath abandoned the synagogue, but will remain with his Church unto the end, Matthew xxiii. 38.,
                           and xxviii. 20. Yet the perfect Church, <i>without spot,</i> is the [Church] triumphant [in heaven]; (Ephesians v. 27.; Worthington)
                           though the Catholic Church, on earth, is ever holy and "the communion of saints." (Haydock) --- <i>Carcasses.</i> Idols, according
                           to some; or rather by the kings being buried on Sion. This is nowhere else reprehended; neither is their building too near
                           the temple, which the prophet here condemns, ver. 8. (Calmet) --- It seems, however, that if these things had been blameable,
                           such a number of pious and wise kings would not have acted thus, nor the prophets have neglected to admonish them of their
                           duty. The carcasses and houses here specified may have been vestiges of idolatry; or, in future, the tombs and palaces were
                           to be at a more respectful distance. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           on this base to avoid treading on the altar, when they placed the wood or victims. But it would be too low; and steps were
                           made for that purpose. The altar was ten, or rather twelve cubits high, and as many broad. Solomon's was ten high and twenty
                           broad. Herod's was a square of forty cubits, raised fifteen from the ground. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           --- Fire descending sometimes from heaven. (St. Jerome) (Worthington) --- It also appeared like a little <i>mountain</i> in

                           were used after the captivity: but it seems little attention was paid to the dimensions of the temple, &amp;c., given by Ezechiel.
                           (Calmet) --- Yet the prophets were present to see the laws of God executed, and never complain of their infringement in these
