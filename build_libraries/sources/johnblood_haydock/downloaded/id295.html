                           fifth Angel....and I saw a star,</I> &amp;c. This again may be to represent the confusion of all things in antichrist's time,
                           or it may signify the fall and apostacy of great and learned men from the Christian faith. Bossuet applies it to the fall
                           of Theodotus, of Byzantium, towards the end of the second age; but certainly no great stress can be laid on such arbitrary
                           applications, which it is no hard matter to invent, as may be seen by the different fancies we may meet with about the <I>locusts,</I>
                           &amp;c. (Witham) --- Here is a description of the rise and progress of the reformation. This trumpet begins with announcing
                           to us the fall of a star from heaven; a very just emblem of the apostacy of Luther, who in quality of a priest and religious
                           man is styled a star, but renouncing his faith and vows, may truly be said to have fallen from heaven upon the earth. (Pastorini,
                           hic.[here]) --- <I>To him</I> (i.e. to the Angel, not to the fallen star) <I>was given the key of the bottomless pit,</I>
                           which properly signifies hell. (Witham) </FONT></P><B>

                           the smoke,</I> &amp;c. Luther and his followers propagated and defended their new doctrines with such heat and violence, as
                           to occasion every where seditions and insurrections, which they seemed to glory in. Luther openly boasted of it. "You complain,"
                           said he, "that by our gospel the world is become more tumultuous; I answer, God be thanked for it; these things I would have
                           so to be, and wo to me if such things were not." --- <I>The sun was darkened,</I> &amp;c. The light of faith, which is the
                           word of God, may well be represented by the sun, according to that of the Psalm cxviii. 105., "Thy word, O Lord, is a lamp
                           to my feet, and a light to my paths." And as the air is the spring of man's respiration and life, it may be a just type of
                           morality, which gives spiritual life and worth to all human actions. By the sun, therefore, and air being darkened, we are
                           to understand faith and morality obscured and perverted by the novel doctrines of the reformers. (Pastorini,</FONT><FONT size=3

                           came out locusts;</I> devils, in antichrist's time, when the chief devil, <I>Abaddon, the destroyer,</I> shall be as it were
                           let loose. Others by locusts, understand the Goths and those barbarous people that made an irruption into the Roman empire,
                           in the time of Decius, about the year 250[A.D. 250]. Others again, by locusts, understand heretics, and especially those heretics
                           that spring from the Jews, and with them denied the divinity of our Saviour Christ, as Theodotus, Praxeas, Noetus, Paul of
                           Samosata, Sabellius, Arius, &amp;c. These were the great enemies of Christian religion, and instruments of the devil: they
                           tormented and infected the souls of men, stinging them like scorpions with the poison of their heresies. They had power for
                           five months, by which is signified for a short term, but had no power to hurt those who were sealed with the seal of God in
                           their foreheads. God protected, at least from sin, his faithful servants. It is to no purpose to give the reader divers fancies
                           and inventions about their shape, their heads, tails, hair, teeth, &amp;c. nor is it worth my while to confute such writers
                           as Mr. Willet, who, Brightman-like, makes Abaddon the pope, and the locusts to be friars mendicant. With this fifth trumpet
                           ended the first of the three woes, as we are told in ver. 12. (Witham) --- The locusts are commonly understood of heretics.
                           They are not able to hurt the green tree; that is, such as have a lively faith, working by charity; but only the reprobate.
                           The latter are represented as <I>prepared to battle,</I> as being ever ready to contend; they wear counterfeit gold on their
                           heads, for all is but pretence and fiction; in shape they are as <I>men,</I> in smoothness of speech as <I>women;</I> in fury
                           and rage against all that opposes them, as <I>lions;</I> their breasts and hearts are as hard as iron; they are full of noise
                           and shuffling; the sting of their pestiferous doctrine is worse than that of a scorpion; but their reign is generally but
                           for a short time. (Challoner) --- Heretics are compared to locusts, says St. Jerome, because they are a species of insects
                           extremely hurtful to mankind, as they occasion famine, eat up the harvest, and even strip the trees and the vines. With very
                           great propriety then may the locusts here mentioned be understood of the first reformers, not only on account of their rapacity,
                           but also for their number. Luther was their leader, by allowing every one to be his own interpreter of Scripture, the effects
                           of which we have described by Dudithius, a learned Protestant divine, in his epistle to Beza. "What sort of people are our
                           Protestants, straggling to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, sometimes to this side, and sometimes to
                           that? You may, perhaps, know what their sentiments in matters of religion are to-day; but you can never certainly tell what
                           they will be to-morrow. In what article of religion do these churches agree, which have cast off the bishop of Rome? Examine
                           all of them from top to bottom, and you will scarce find one thing affirmed by one, which is not immediately condemned by
                           another for wicked doctrine." The same confusion of opinions is thus described by an English Protestant, the learned Dr. Walton:
                           "Aristarchus heretofore could scarcely find seven wise men in Greece, but with us scarce are to be found so many idiots; for
                           all are doctors, all are divinely learned; there is not so much as the meanest fanatic, or jack-pudding, who does not give
                           you his own dreams for the word of God." (Pastorini, hic.[here]) </FONT></P><B>

                           the shapes of the locusts.</I> We now come to the description of these locusts, which expresses the spirit of sedition and
                           rebellion that animated the reformers and their proselytes. Luther proclaimed himself the leader in this as well as in other
                           articles of the new discipline: see his works, particularly Contra statem Ecclesiæ et <SPAN lang=EN>falsò </SPAN>nominatum
                           ordinem Episcoporum, lib. contra Sylvest. Prieras, De <SPAN lang=EN>Sæculari </SPAN>potestate et Contra Rusticos, &amp;c.
                           Erasmus thus describes the effects of the inflammatory doctrine of these ministers of evangelical liberty: "I saw them (the
                           people) come forth from their sermons with fierce looks and threatening countenances," like men "that just come from hearing
                           bloody invectives and seditious speeches." Accordingly, we found "these evangelical people always ready to rise up in arms,
                           and equally as good at fighting as at disputing." The learned Protestant historian, Dr. Heylin, in his Cosmography, (B. i.)
                           says of the Calvinists: "Rather than their discipline should not be admitted, and the episcopal government destroyed in all
                           the Churches of Christ, they were resolved to depose kings, ruin kingdoms, and to subvert the fundamental constitutions of
                           all civil states." --- <I>And on their heads,</I> &amp;c. These crowns shew clearly their general spirit of independence;
                           and their faces being as the faces of men, indicate the presumption with which they announced themselves as teachers of orthodox
                           and holy doctrine. (Pastorini, hic.[here]) </FONT></P><B>

                           they had hair as the hair of women.</I> This latter allusion, unhappily for the sectaries, betrays too plainly their sensual
                           disposition towards that sex, their shameful doctrine on that score, and the scandalous example of their practice. Luther,
                           in despite of a vow he had solemnly made to God of observing continence, married; and married a nun, equally bound as himself
                           to that sacred religious promise! But, as St. Jerome says, "it is rare to find a heretic that loves chastity." Luther's example
                           had indeed been anticipated by Carlostadius, a priest and ringleader of the Sacramentarians, who had married a little before;
                           and it was followed by most of the heads of the reformation. Zuinglius, a priest and chief of that sect which bore his name,
                           took a wife. Bucer, a religious man of the order of St. Dominic, became a Lutheran, left his cloister, and married a nun.
                           &#338;colampadius, a Brigittin monk, became a Zuinglian, and also married. Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, had also his
                           wife. Peter Martyr, a canon regular, embraced the doctrine of Calvin; but followed the example of Luther, and married a nun.
                           Ochin, general of the Capuchins, became a Lutheran, and also married. Beza, the most celebrated minister in the Calvinistic
                           party, being asked in his old age, by an intimate acquaintance of his, (Deshayes, governor of Montargis) what was the leading
                           reason which connected him so closely with the Calvinists? Beza called in his mistress, a beautiful young girl who lived with
                           him, and said: "That is the principle reason which convinces me of the excellence of my religion." (Marsollier's Life of St.
                           Francis de Sales, book iii.) --- Thus the principal leaders in the reformation went forth preaching the new gospel, with two
                           marks upon them---apostacy from the faith, and open violation of the most sacred vows. The passion of lust, it is also well
                           known, hurried Henry VIII of England, into a separation from the Catholic Church, and ranked him amongst the reformers. (Pastorini,
                           hic.[here]) --- <I>Teeth of lions.</I> What is more known than the truth of this representation? Did not the reformers, wherever
                           they got footing, pillage the churches, seize the church possessions, destroy the monasteries, and appropriate to themselves
                           the revenues? Such was the case in Germany, in Holland, in France, in Switzerland, in Scotland, and in England; what a scene
                           of rapine! Let it suffice to say, that in the reign of Henry VIII were suppressed not less than 645 monasteries, 90 colleges,
                           110 hospitals, and 2374 chantries and free chapels; (Baker's Chron.) the lands, &amp;c. of all which were confiscated to the
                           king. Is not this to devour with lions' teeth? The whole explication here given of the allegory of the locusts, we presume,
                           appears so consonant with the history of the reformation, that the propriety will not be denied. The application is even so
                           obvious, that the learned Protestant divine, Dr. Walton, used it for describing the multitudes of new sectaries that swarmed
                           out of the English Church. Thus he speaks in the preface of his Polyglot: "The bottomless pit seems to have been set open,
                           from whence a smoke has risen, which has darkened the heavens and the stars; and locusts are come out with stings, a numerous
                           race of sectaries and heretics, who have renewed all the ancient heresies, and invented many monstrous opinions of their own.
                           These have filled our cities, villages, camps, houses, nay our pulpits too, and lead the poor deluded people with them to
                           the pit of perdition." (Pastorini, Apocalypse ix.)</FONT></P><B>

                           thus I saw the horses in the vision.</I> The horsemen appeared to St. John with breastplates of fire, and of hyacinth, and
                           of brimstone. By this expression is indicated the firing of carabines, or such firearms as cavalry use, which are applied
                           to the breast when shot off. St. John took the fire that issued out of the muskets to come from the horsemen's breast, on
                           which the muskets rested, and so thought the horsemen had breastplates of fire. The prophet here even describes to us the
                           composition of gunpowder, with its three ingredients, viz. brimstone or sulphur, fire or charcoal, and hyacinth or saltpetre;
                           because saltpetre, when set on fire, emits a flame of a fine purple colour, similar to the colour of the hyacinth stone. Here
                           then we see revealed to St. John both the composition and use of gunpowder, to which he and all mankind at that time were
                           strangers. Then it is said: <I>And the heads of the horses,</I> &amp;c. Here is pointed out the artillery of the army, or
                           cannon. He saw in this vision the whole army drawn up at a distance, and the artillery placed upon a line with the cavalry.
                           He seemed to confound the cannon with the horses, and the cannons' mouths with the mouths of the horses, as the height of
                           both from the ground is nearly the same. He describes the appearances as he saw in the vision, not the reality. When therefore
                           he says, <I>the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions,</I> it is the same as if he said, the mouths of the cannon
                           were as to the noise they made, like the mouths of roaring lions. Hence it appears that St. John, in this vision, both saw
                           the fire of the cannon, and heard the explosion.</FONT></P><B>

                           Christians, is a groundless invention of the late pretended reformers, neither supported by any authority or reason; (though
                           Dr. W. is pleased to join with them) whereas all Catholics (and as he calls them, papists) have constantly declared in their
