                           <i>War.</i> The author of the new edition of St. Jerome mentions two manuscripts and there are several printed editions, which
                           reduce these numbers to one half. Castalio adopts this correction, asserting that the Greek and Josephus are on his side,
                           which is not true. (Calmet) --- We must however observe, that there is some doubt with respect to Josephus, (Haydock) as some
                           of the oldest Latin editions acknowledge the smaller numbers; and Vignoles (i. 29.) conjectures, that the Greek copies did
                           the same formerly, since Aborbanel "accuses Josephus of having made Jeroboam's loss no more than 50,000, contrary to the Hebrew
                           text," ver. 17. This learned author is of opinion, that the Jews sometimes expressed their numbers by figures, (Kennicott)
                           analogous to those which the later Arabs borrowed from the Indians; though, in more ancient times, the letters of the alphabet
                           had been used. Both customs seem to have prevailed; (Erpenius) and this may account for many variations, as the omission of
                           a single cypher, resembling our period (.), might easily occasion much confusion. Kennicott (Diss. i., and ii.) seems to suspect,
                           that the ancient versions have been made to agree with the corrupted Hebrew, no less than Josephus; and that many of the large
                           numbers, recorded in Scripture, (which might countenance what we here read) are incorrect. See chap. xvii. 13, 19., and xiv.
                           8., comp.[compare] with xvi. 1., and xxv. 6., comp.[compare] with 4 Kings xiii. 7. It is certain (Haydock) many Latin manuscripts
                           confirm the edition of Sixtus V, which has the smaller numbers; and this is the case with most of the older manuscripts and
                           editions. How St. Jerome expressed it, we cannot easily determine. The editor of his works has been guided chiefly by the
                           Memmian canon. See 2 Kings xv. 7. Lyranus quotes St. Jerome, as reading 50,000; (ver. 7) and it is so expressed in the Paris
                           editions of 1534 and (Haydock) 1546, of the Hebrew questions on Paralipomenon. But Erasmus doubts whether this be the genuine
                           work of St. Jerome, (Kennicott) or in the state in which he left it. If we consult the more ancient manuscripts and editions,
                           prior to that of Clement VIII, we shall allow that they are more favourable to the smaller numbers, on this occasion; and
                           are more likely to exhibit the pure version of the holy doctor, (Haydock) as the later editions have had "the Hebrew fountains"
                           also in view. (Kennicott) --- If however we adhere to the received numbers, (Haydock) we must remember that kings, at that
                           time, led forth to battle all their subjects who were able to bear arms. Under Moses there were 600,000. David found 1,100,000
                           in Israel, and 470,000 in Juda, exclusive of Levi and Benjamin; (chap. xxi. 5.) or, at least, as it is expressed [in] 2 Kings
                           xxiv. 9., in all, 1,300,000. Asa was at the head of 580,000, chap. xiv. 8., &amp;c.</font></p><b>

                           seemed this covenant was to be inviolable; and it had its effect, notwithstanding the crimes of many of the kings. The Arabs
                           still regard the partaking of bread and salt as the most sacred covenant. (Calmet) --- "The ancients prayed when they placed
                           salt before their guests, that, as salt partook of two natures, so they might be cemented together in concord." (Tzetzez on
