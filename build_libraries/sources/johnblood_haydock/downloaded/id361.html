                                    we will give them ours.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 One thing there is for which so great a good is deferred: We must
                                    circumcise every male among us, following the manner of the nation.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And their substance, and cattle, and all that they possess, shall
                                    be ours; only in this let us condescend, and by dwelling together, we shall make one people.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And they all agreed, and circumcised all the males.</font></p>

                                    two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dina, taking their swords, entered boldly into the city, and slew
                                    all the men:*</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And they killed also Hemor and Sichem, and took away their sister

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 And when they were gone out, the other sons of Jacob came upon the
                                    slain; and plundered the city in revenge of the rape.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And they took their sheep, and their herds, and their asses, wasting
                                    all they had in their houses and in their fields.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And their children and wives they took captive.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And when they had boldly perpetrated these things, Jacob said to Simeon
                                    and Levi: You have troubled me, and made me hateful to the Chanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of this land. We are
                                    few: they will gather themselves together and kill me; and both I, and my house shall be destroyed.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 They answered: Should they abuse our sister as a strumpet?</font></p>
