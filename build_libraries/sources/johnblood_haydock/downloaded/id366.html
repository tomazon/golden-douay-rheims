                           fury. She wishes to take away Joseph's life, according to the laws of Egypt against adulterers. Diodorus says Sesostris burnt

                           Pererius thinks this was the same Putiphar, who, recognizing the innocence of Joseph, allows him every indulgence in prison;
                           but does not liberate him, for fear of the dishonour and resentment of his wife. (Calmet) --- He had before put him in <I>irons.</I>
                           (Psalm civ. 18; Wisdom x. 13.) Joseph here exercises at once the four cardinal virtues. <I>Prudence,</I> in keeping out of
                           the company of his mistress, as the Hebrew express it, ver. 10: "He yielded not to lie with her, or to be in her company."
                           (Haydock) --- <I>Justice,</I> in regard to his master. <I>Fortitude,</I> in bearing with all sorts of hardships, loss of character,
                           &amp;c. And <I>Temperance,</I> by refusing to gratify the most violent of all passions, at an age when it is the most insidious
                           and ungovernable. This makes the fathers exclaim, We wonder more at the conduct of Joseph, than at the delivery of the three
                           children from the Babylonian furnace. [Daniel iii.] For, like them, Joseph continues unhurt, and more shining, in the midst
                           of the flames. (St. Chrysostom) (Tirinus) --- The stories of Hippolitus, Bellerophon, &amp;c., seem to be copied from this.
