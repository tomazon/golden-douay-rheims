                           These registers were preserved by those who fled from the arms of Salmanasar, into the kingdom of Juda. Such records were
                           preserved with the utmost care, and were collected by the author; who could give an account of what happened during and after
                           the captivity, as he was an irreproachable eye-witness; not to mention the divine inspiration, which places his testimony
                           out of the reach of criticism. (Calmet) --- <I>And Juda;</I> perhaps by some historian. (Menochius) --- <I>Babylon,</I> while
                           Israel was removed elsewhere, by the Assyrians. (Haydock) --- The genealogies of Israel being hitherto recited, now those

                           He only treats of those who returned first, (Tirinus) under Esdras. (Haydock) --- Nehemias brought back others, and more returned
                           afterwards. Many also retook possession of their lands, which they had enjoyed before the captivity, 1 Esdras iii. 12. ---
                           <I>Nathineans.</I> These were the posterity of the Gabaonites, whose office was to bring wood, water, &amp;c., for the service
                           of the temple. (Challoner) (Josue ix. 27.) --- David and Solomon consigned others of the Chanaanites, whose lives they spared,
                           to perform the same office. They were like public slaves. The number of those who returned was so small, that days were appointed
                           for all the people to help to carry wood for the temple. At Jerusalem the Nathineans, "or people given," resided on the east
                           side of the city; (2 Esdras ii. 26.) and other towns were assigned them, 1 Esdras ii. 70. (Calmet) --- The people continued
                           to be divided into four classes, as they had been before the captivity. (Malvenda)</FONT></P><B>

                           People from these tribes particularly, (Haydock) as well as from others, had fled to the kingdom of Juda, when the Assyrians
                           took their brethren prisoners; and these returned to Jerusalem. (Menochius) --- Cyrus gave a general leave for all Israel
                           to return. The country was too spacious for them; and it was found necessary to force the tenth part of the people, by lot,
                           to repair to Jerusalem, as it wanted inhabitants, 2 Esdras xi. 1.</FONT></P><B>

                           at the king's gate, even though there was none sitting upon the throne after the captivity. (Calmet) --- Protestants, ("who

                           This Phinees lived after the captivity, (Menochius) and possessed the same power as Eleazar and Joiada, chap. xii. 27., and
                           Numbers iii. 32. It is not necessary to refute the fables of the Rabbins, who pretend that the famous Phinees was an angel,
                           who appeared at different times, and particularly at the return from Babylon. (Calmet) --- Hebrew may refer to the ancient

                           back. (Calmet) --- He might also give private instructions to David for the same purpose; (Haydock) as Gad and Nathan did,
                           2 Paralipomenon xxix. 25. The same plans were still adopted, though the number of Levites was smaller. (Calmet) --- <I>Trust,</I>
