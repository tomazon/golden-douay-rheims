                           and numerous armies, which pressed one upon another. On the night of Pentecost, the priests, after a confused noise, heard
                           distinctly these words, "Let us go hence;" which are supposed to have been spoken by the angels, who had hitherto guarded
                           and protected the holy city, but now were taking their leave of it. Josephus was in the Roman camp, before the city, during

                           their ancient and ill-fated country. Thus was Jerusalem trodden under foot, till the time of the nations was accomplished;
