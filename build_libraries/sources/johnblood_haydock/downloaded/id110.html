                           is true, only the elect, or <I>predestined,</I> are given by a special and uncommon mercy. In this sense St. Augustine, (tract.

                           our Saviour shewed, that his preaching was directed, not to the Jews only, but to every nation of the earth. Are then all
                           saved? Christ has done sufficient for the salvation of all, and if they are not saved, it is the fault, not of him that speaketh,
                           but of those that receive not his word. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxxix. in Joan.)</FONT></P><B>

                           whom thou hast sent</I>[2]. The Arians, from these words, pretended that the Father only is the true God. St. Augustine and
                           divers others answer, that the sense and construction is, <I>that they may know thee, and also Jesus Christ thy Son, whom
                           thou hast sent to be the only true God.</I> We may also expound them with St. Chrysostom and others, so that the Father is
                           here called the only <I>true God,</I> not to exclude the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who are the same one true God with the Father;
                           but only to exclude the false gods of the Gentiles. Let the Socinians take notice, that (1 John v. 20.) the Son of God, Jesus
                           Christ, is expressly called <I>the true God,</I> even with the Greek article, upon which they commonly lay so much stress.
                           (Witham) --- <I>Life everlasting.</I> Both the life of glory in heaven, and of grace here, consisteth in the knowledge of
                           God; the former in perfect vision, the latter in faith working by charity. For knowledge of God, without keeping his commandments,
                           is not true knowledge, but unprofitable knowledge. (1 John xi.[ii.?])</FONT></P><B>

                           should be made subject to him, even as he was man, and appointed to be judge of the living and the dead. See 1 Corinthians

                           takes notice, that Christ saith afterwards, (ver. 13.) <I>these things I speak in the world:</I> therefore he was still for
                           some short time in the world. And as to his true invisible presence with his Church, he gave us this promise, (Matthew xxviii.

                           Christ, as man, says St. Augustine, asks of his Father, to preserve those disciples whom he had given him, who were to preach

                           union of love and affection. See St. Chrysostom, St. Cyril, and St. Augustine on these words. (Witham) --- Here Jesus Christ

                           presence should be less beneficial to them. --- <I>And none of them hath perished, except the son of perdition,</I> the wretched
                           Judas, whose fall was foretold in the Scriptures. (Psalm cviii.) He hath perished, that is, now is about being lost, by his
                           own fault, says St. Chrysostom on this place. And St. Augustine on Psalm cxxxviii. <I>How did the devil enter into the heart
                           of Judas? he could not have entered, had not he given him place.</I> (Witham) --- <I>That the Scripture may be fulfilled:</I>
                           this does not any ways shew, that it was the will of God that Judas should be lost; but only that what happened to Judas was
                           conformable to the prophecies, and not occasioned by them. Who will doubt, says St. Augustine, (lib. de Unit. Eccl. chap.
                           ix.) but that Judas might, if he pleased, have abstained from betraying Christ. But God foretold it, because he foresaw clearly
                           the future perversity of his disposition. (Calmet) --- See above, (xiii. 18.) one of the principal passages of Scripture relative
                           to the treachery of Judas, in which the traitor's crime had been predicted.</FONT></P><B>

                           tells his Father the reason why the world hated them, because they were not of the world. By generation, indeed, they were
                           of the world; but by regeneration, they were not of the world. Thus they became like to himself, being born again of that
                           Holy Spirit, by whose all powerful operation, he took upon himself the form of a servant. But although they were not of the
                           world, still was it necessary that they should remain in the world; therefore he continues, I ask not that thou wouldst take
                           them out of the world. (St. Augustine, tract. 107. in Joan.)</FONT></P><B>

                           Christ is a great comfort to all Christians; it is introduced in the holy Canon of the Mass, before the consecration, as here
