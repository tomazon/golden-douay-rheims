                           Saul was still his king, how wicked soever, and this title rendered his person inviolable. The eastern nations are very seldom
                           guilty of rebellion, or of murdering their kings; a thing of which we find so many examples in the Roman, English, and French
                           histories. (Calmet) --- A private man could not lay violent hands upon the king without a crime; and therefore David represses
                           Abisai, and commits his cause to God, chap. xxiv. 13. (Menochius) --- He will not permit any one to destroy the life of the
                           king, though he was already anointed to succeed him. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>
