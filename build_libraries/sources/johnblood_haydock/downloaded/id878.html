                           <i>Joab.</i> These instructions given by David to his son, with relation to Joab and Semei, proceeded not from any rancour
                           of heart, or private pique; but from a zeal for justice: that crimes so public and heinous might not pass unpunished. (Challoner)
                           --- David and Solomon esteemed themselves, in a manner, defiled, as long as these continued unpunished, ver. 31. Joab had
                           behaved to David with great insolence, after the death of Absalom. (Haydock) --- He had lately sided with Adonias. (Menochius)
                           --- But what touched the good old king more particularly, were the treacherous murders of two great generals, who had put
                           themselves under his protection, and were endeavouring to promote his welfare. Only the fear of greater commotions had hitherto
                           prevented David from bringing his nephew to public execution, as the people expected. He deemed it requisite to remind his
                           successor of this obligation, when his power should be sufficiently strong, that the impunity of such daring offenders might
                           not destroy the commonwealth. (Haydock) --- <i>Peace.</i> Pretending affection. Joab had treated Abner and Amasa as the worst
                           of enemies, and their blood had stained his garments. (Menochius)</font></p><b>

                           services to his uncle, for which he had been rewarded. He had been at the head of the armies 40 years. His great age rendered
                           him now less formidable; particularly as the nation enjoyed peace.</font></p><b>

                           <i>David.</i> Thus died this perfect model of princes, and this great saint, whose only fault, of consequence, was occasioned
                           by Bethsabee: (2 Kings xi. 4.) and this served to display his repentance. (St. Chrysostom, hom. lxxvii.) --- He prefigured
                           Jesus Christ in a wonderful manner; in his birth, at the same city; his election, in preference to his brethren; his persecutions,
                           and subsequent glory. Jesus was, in like manner, betrayed by a false friend, and obliged to go out of Jerusalem, laden with
                           his cross. But he acquired fresh splendour by his sufferings, and purchased a more faithful people. The tomb of David remained
                           for many ages, Acts ii. 29. Josephus says that it contained vast riches: but this seems to be fabulous. St. Jerome often went
                           to pray at this tomb. (Ep. ad Marcel.) --- If it be now unknown, the Holy Ghost has left us a more illustrious monument to
                           the honour of this great man, in the Psalms, and Ecclesiasticus xlvii. 2., &amp;c. (Calmet) --- We have now only an abridgment

                           not be enjoyed by any but his successor. (Grotius) --- Hence Adonias might be suspected of ambitious projects, as his party
                           was still formidable. (Calmet) --- The marriage seems also to be unlawful. (Menochius) See chap. i. 4. --- Yet, if the aforesaid
                           custom subsisted at that time; or, if the marriage had been evidently prohibited, both Adonias and Bethsabee must have acted
                           in a very inconsistent manner, so that we must hesitate before we pronounce sentence. (Haydock) --- Many condemn Solomon of
                           precipitation and cruelty in his judgment; (Cajetan) while others approve of his conduct, (Theodoret, q. 7,) and think any

                           <i>they anointed....Sadoc to be high priest,</i> 1 Paralipomenon xxix. 22. (Salien) --- But now, Solomon orders Abiathar to
                           retire to his estate, in punishment of his conspiracy. (Calmet) --- He might have justly put him to death, if he had committed
                           a crime worthy of it; as his dignity did not give him a right to disturb the peace of the state with impunity. (Haydock) ---
                           Solomon acted as a prophet. (Worthington) --- God had long before denounced that the family of Eleazar should regain the dignity,
                           which Heli had obtained by some means or other, 1 Kings ii. 31. (Haydock) --- Solomon only put the divine decree in execution.
                           (Pineda vi. 15.) --- Sadoc had perhaps also passed sentence, as the Levitical tribe had a great sway in the courts of judicature.
                           (Menochius) --- Abiathar was still honoured with his former title, chap. iv. 4. But he was not permitted to officiate, (Calmet)
                           nor to remain in the royal city, as he seemed now to be a dangerous man. (Haydock) --- Anathoth was a sacerdotal town in Benjamin.
                           (Menochius) --- A portion of the suburbs had been assigned to Abiathar, unless he had obtained a field by inheritance, or
                           by marrying an heiress, See Jeremias xxxii. 7. (Calmet)</font></p><b>
