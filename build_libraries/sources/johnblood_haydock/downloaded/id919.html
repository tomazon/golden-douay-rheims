                           <i>Days,</i> before the destruction of Sennacherib's army; (ver. 6.; Menochius) though some suppose that Ezechias was afflicted
                           with sickness, because he had not shewn sufficient gratitude for his deliverance, 2 Paralipomenon xxxii. 24. (Eusebius and
                           St. Jerome, in Isaias xxxix. (Calmet) --- But it might be sent only to purify him the more, &amp;c. (Menochius) --- He fell
                           ill the same year that the Assyrian invaded his dominions, ver. 6., and chap. xviii. 13. The nature of his disorder in not
                           fully known. (It was probably an abscess, (Calmet) brought on by a fever; or an ulcer, for which the things which promote
                           suppuration, are always proper. Thus God teaches us to make use of natural remedies, yet so as to place our whole confidence
                           in him. (Haydock) --- Others think it was a pleurisy, (John xxi. Thesaur. 26.) or a quinsey, (Barthol.) or the pestilence,
                           &amp;c. (Calmet) --- <i>Unto death,</i> of an illness, which would naturally have proved mortal; as that of Benadad was the
                           reverse, chap. viii. 10. --- <i>Not live,</i> very shortly; though he does not express the time. We should always bear in
                           mind this awful warning. (Haydock) --- The prediction was conditional, like that of Jonas; (iii. 4.; Calmet) otherwise it
                           would have been sinful to strive to render it ineffectual. (Estius)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Lines,</i> according to the usual course of the sun. An instantaneous motion of this kind would, in reality, be as difficult,
                           as the retrogradation. But it might not strike the people so much. (Haydock) --- Some take the lines to designate hours. But
                           the sun is never up twenty hours in that country; and it must have been at such a height, as that it might appear visibly
                           to recede, or to go forward, ten lines. We may therefore suppose, that they consisted only of half hours, (Tirinus) or less.
                           (Calmet) --- If the retrograde motion were instantaneous, as Cajetan believes, the day would only be five hours longer than
                           usual; (Menochius) but if otherwise, it would be ten; as the sun would occupy five hours in going back, and as many to regain
                           its former station. (Tirinus) --- Usher supposes that the night was as much shortened, that so astronomical observations may
                           still be verified without any confusion. But that would introduce a fresh miracle. Some assert that only the shadow went back,
                           without any derangement in the heavenly bodies. Spinosa laughs at the ignorance of those people, who mistook the effects of
                           a parhelion for a miracle. This author may boast of his superior knowledge. But how came the sages of Babylon (ver. 12.) to
                           be unacquainted with such a natural cause? How came it so opportunely (Calmet) at the time appointed by the prophet? What
                           improbable explanations are not those forced to admit, who deny to the Almighty the power of changing his own works! (Haydock)
                           --- The silence of profane historians respecting this miracle, is of little consequence. Herodotus (ii. 142.) seems to hint
                           at it, as well as at that under Josue; (x.) being informed "by the Egyptians, that during 10340 years, the sun had risen four
                           times in an extraordinary manner. It had risen twice where it ought naturally to set, and had set as often where it should
                           rise." He might have said more simply, that the sun had twice gone back. See Solin, 45. (Calmet) --- St. Dion. Areop. ep.
                           7. ad Polycarp. --- This last author thinks that this day was twenty hours longer than usual, supposing that the lines designate
                           so many hours, and that the sun kept going back for ten hours. (Worthington)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Dial.</i> Hebrew also, "steps." St. Jerome confesses that he followed Symmachus in Isaias xxxviii. 7. Whether this dial
                           resembled one of ours, (Grotius) or was made in the form of steps, (St. Cyril, hom. 3, in Isaias, &amp;c.) or rather of a
                           half globe, (Calmet) after the Babylonian fashion, (Vitruvius ix. 9.) is not clear. Some have asserted that hours were not
                           known to the Hebrews, before the captivity. (Usher, the year of the world 3291.) --- But Toby[Tobias], (xii. 22.) who wrote
                           at Nineve, under the reign of Manasses, clearly speaks of them. The Egyptians pretend that they invented water hour-glasses.
                           But the invention of dials is attributed to the Chaldeans, from whom Anaximander introduced them among the Greeks, under the
                           reign of Cyrus. He died in the year of the world 3457. --- <i>Achaz</i> had much to do with Theglathphalasar; (chap. xvii.
                           8.) and probably obtained this curiosity from the same country. In more ancient times, people measured time by the length
                           of their shadow, and were invited to a feast at such a foot, in the same manner as we should invite for such an hour. (Palladius,
                           Rustic. xii.) (Calmet) --- Till the year of Rome 595, when Nasica dedicated the first water hour-glass, the Romans knew not
                           how the time passed on cloudy days. (Pliny, [Natural History?] vii. 60.) (Vitruvius ix. 9.) --- Grotius supposes that the
                           dial of Achaz was a concave semicircular gnomon, in which a globe was placed, the shadow of which fell on twenty-eight lines.
