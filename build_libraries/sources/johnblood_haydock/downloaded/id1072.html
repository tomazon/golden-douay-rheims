                           as he is buried with honour, an set like a more elevated sheaf, to inspect the rest. (Calmet) --- <i>Godiss,</i> is rendered
                           by Protestants, "tomb," (margin) "heap." But (chap. v. 26.) where only the word occurs again, we find "a shock of corn," and
                           this comparison seems very suitable here. The damned shall <i>watch,</i> alas, when it will be to no purpose, among the heap
                           of fellow-sufferers, who would not think while they had time to repent. After millions of night spent thus without sleep or
                           ease, we may imagine we hear their mournful lamentations from the depth of the abyss. Always misery! and never any hope of
                           ease! (Haydock) --- "Eternity," says Bridayne, (ser. in Maury's Eloq.) "is a pendulum, the vibration of which sounds continually,
                           Always! Never! In the mean while, a reprobate cries out: What o'clock is it? And the same voice answers, Eternity!" Thus at
                           last the wicked shal awake from the sleep in which they have spent their days; (Haydock) and their watching, restless, and
                           immortal souls (St. Thomas Aquinas) will bitterly lament their past folly. What profit will they derive from the honours paid
                           to their corpse by surviving friends, (Haydock) even though they be embalmed, and seem to live in marble statues? (Pineda)</font></p><b>

                           <i>Acceptable to the gravel of Cocytus.</i> The Hebrew word, which St. Jerome has here rendered by the name <i>Cocytus,</i>
                           (which the poets represent as a river in hell) signifies a <i>valley</i> or a <i>torrent:</i> and in this place, is taken
                           for the low region of death, and hell: which willingly, as it were, receives the wicked at their death: who are ushered in
                           by innumerable others that have gone before them; and are followed by multitudes above number. (Challoner) --- Isaias (xiv.
                           9.) and Ezechiel (xxxii. 21.) describe the splendid reception in hell of the kings of Babylon and of Egypt, nearly in the
                           same manner as Job does that of any sinner who has lived in prosperity, chap. xxxviii. 17. He gives life to the whole creation,
                           in the true spirit of poetry. (Calmet) --- The rich man is represented as tenderly embraced by his mother earth; (chap. i.
                           21.; Haydock) the very stones and turf press lightly upon him; as the ancients prayed, <i>Sit tibi terra levis.</i> Hebrew,
                           "the stones <i>or</i> clods of the torrent (Calmet) shall be sweet to him, and he," &amp;c. (Haydock) --- St. Jerome has chosen
                           to mention a particular river, instead of the general term <i>nel,</i> "a torrent or vale," to intimate that Job is speaking
                           of the state after death. --- <i>Cocytus</i> is a branch of the Styx, a river of Arcadia, of a noxious quality, which the
                           poets have place in hell. (Pineda) --- Septuagint, "The pebbles of the torrent became sweet to him, and in his train every
                           man shall come, and unnumbered men before him." Alexandrian manuscript has "men of number;" the two first letters of&nbsp;<i><u>anarithmetoi</u></i>
                           being omitted. (Haydock) --- The Church reads in her office for St. Stephen, <i>Lapides torrentis illi dulces fuerunt: ipsum
                           sequuntur omnes animæ justæ.</i> Many explain this passage of Job as a menace. The wicked have carried their insolence so
                           far as to (Calmet) give orders to (Haydock) be buried with the utmost pomp: but in the other world, they shall be thrown ignominiously
                           among the other dead. (St. Gregory, &amp;c.) (Calmet) --- They were little moved with the thought of death, as it was common
                           to all. But what will they think of eternal misery? (Haydock)</font></p><b>
