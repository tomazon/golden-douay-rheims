                           "She despised and went from him." Septuagint, "She was vexed at <I>or</I> she left him." (Calmet) --- Josephus, "as he was
                           deeply in love with her on account of her beauty, he was displeased that she did not correspond with his love. Hence a quarrel
                           ensuing, the woman would not bear his continual expostulations, and leaving her husband, after four months, returns to her
                           parents. Hither, overcome by his love for her, he follows, and, by the mediation of her parents, he is reconciled to his wife,
                           both agreeing to lay aside all complaints." (Antiquities v. 2.) --- It is clear that the Septuagint, Vulgate, &amp;c., have
                           read the text in a different manner from what we do at present, and their explanation seems more rational than the Hebrew.
                           For, is it probable that a Levite should go to be reconciled to an adulteress, contrary to the intention of the law (Deuteronomy
                           xxiv. 2., Jeremias iii. 1., and Proverbs xviii. 22.) and the custom of the Jews, as well as of pagan nations, who looked upon
                           those with contempt, who kept a woman of this character? The word concubine, we have often remarked, signifies a wife without
                           a dowry, &amp;c., (Calmet) such as the Mahometans still maintain as lawful wives. (Busbec. ii.) --- <I>Months.</I> Josephus

                           labour, and the young Levite might, through ignorance, suppose it lawful for them to do the like. (Menochius) --- It is lawful
                           to advise a man, who is about to commit two crimes, to be satisfied with the less: but we cannot persuade any one to do even
                           the smallest offence, that good may ensue, Romans iii. 8. The ignorance or good intention of these people might extenuate,
                           but could hardly excuse their conduct, as it was unjust to the woman, whom the people of Gabaa did not ask for; and they ought
                           rather to have encountered the utmost fury of the populace. Had the latter even come to the extremity proposed, if the Levite
                           had made all possible resistance, his virtue could not have been injured. (Calmet) --- His crown would have been doubled,
                           as St. Lucy observed when the judge threatened to have her prostituted. <I>Castitas mihi duplicabitur ad coronam.</I> (Dec.
                           xiii.) (Haydock) --- Perhaps in the agitation of mind, caused by such a brutal proposal, the old man might have been so disturbed,
                           as scarcely to know what he was saying, and he did not afterwards expose his daughter. (Calmet) --- But the Levite, seeing
                           him in such a dilemma, on his account (Haydock) took his wife by force. (Hebrew, &amp;c.) See Tostat; Bonfrere. (Estius) (Calmet)

                                    shalt depart.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 And they sat down together, and ate and drank. And the father of the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 But when morning was come, the Levite prepared to go on his journey.

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And the young man arose to set forward with his wife and servant. And
                                    his father-in-law spoke to him again: Consider that the day is declining, and draweth toward evening: tarry with me to-day
                                    also, and spend the day in mirth, and to-morrow thou shalt depart, that thou mayest go into thy house.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 His son-in-law would not consent to his words: but forthwith went
                                    forward, and came over-against Jebus, which by another name is called Jerusalem, leading with him two asses loaden, and his
                                    concubine.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And now they were come near Jebus, and the day was far spent: and
                                    the servant said to his master: Come, I beseech thee, let us turn into the city of the Jebusites, and lodge there.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 His master answered him: I will not go into the town of another nation,
                                    who are not of the children of Israel, but I will pass over to Gabaa:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And when I shall come thither, we will lodge there, or at least in

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 So they passed by Jebus, and went on their journey, and the sun went

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And they turned into it to lodge there. And when they were come in,
                                    they sat in the street of the city, for no man would receive them to lodge.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 And behold they saw an old man, returning out of the field and from

                                    bundles in the street of the city, and said to him: Whence comest thou? and whither goest thou?</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 He answered him: We came out from Bethlehem Juda, and we are going
                                    to our home, which is on the side of Mount Ephraim, from whence we went to Bethlehem: and now we go to the house of God, and
                                    none will receive us under his roof:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 We have straw and hay for provender of the asses, and bread and wine
                                    for the use of myself and of thy handmaid, and of the servant that is with me: we want nothing but lodging.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And the old man answered him: Peace be with thee: I will furnish all
                                    things that are necessary: only I beseech thee, stay not in the street.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And he brought him into his house, and gave provender to his asses:

                                    and drink, after the labour of the journey, the men of that city, sons of Belial (that is, without yoke), came and beset the
                                    old man's house, and began to knock at the door, calling to the master of the house, and saying: *Bring forth the man that
                                    came into thy house, that we may abuse him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And the old man went out to them, and said: Do not so, my brethren,
