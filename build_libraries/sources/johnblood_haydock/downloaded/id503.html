                           Moses had received this injunction, before he ascended the mount the second time, Exodus xxv. 10. But he executed it only
                           after he had received the second tables of the law, Exodus xxxvii. 1. (Menochius) --- Some pretend that the made an ark of
                           setim-wood, to contain the tables, till Beseleel should have completed his, which was covered with gold, and inclosed the

                           by Mount Hor, for there Aaron died, Numbers xx. This and the following verses seem to be inserted by way of parenthesis, (Challoner)
                           as far as the 10th. The reason of their insertion here cannot easily be explained; but we must adore, in silence, the designs
                           of the Holy Spirit. (Calmet) --- Moses had just mentioned the ark, designed to contain the tables of the law; and as the priests
                           and Levites were to be the guardians of those sacred things, he takes occasion to specify something with respect to their
                           institution, &amp;c. Mosera was perhaps twice visited by the Hebrews. The first time, they came thither from <I>Beroth</I>-Benejaacan,
                           or from "the well <I>of the children of Jacan,</I>" and thence measured back their steps; though, the second time, Mosera,
                           or Moseroth, is not noticed, because it had been specified already, and they did not stop long there, but proceeded to Gadgad,
                           Numbers xxxiii. 30. (Bonfrere) (Menochius) --- Others think that Mosera and Benejaacan are not the same places as Moseroth
                           and Beroth Bensacan, though the names be similar. (Cornelius a Lapide) --- Perhaps it will be more satisfactory to acknowledge,
                           that Mosera has been transposed by the copyists, as it ought to come before Beroth, particularly as Moses places it in that
                           order, where he gives an account of the 42 stations; and the Samaritan copy agrees with him in this place. (Calmet) --- It
                           also retains many words which have been omitted in Hebrew, and in all the versions taken from it; whence the omission seems
                           to have taken place before the appearance of the version of the Septuagint. The Samaritan version, which is acknowledged to
                           have preceded the Septuagint, agrees with its text, and reads, "And the children of Israel journeyed from <I>Moseroth,</I>
                           and pitched in <I>Benejaakan:</I> from thence they journeyed, and pitched in <I>Hagidgad:</I> from thence they journeyed,
                           and pitched in <I>Jotbathah,</I> a land of rivers of waters: from thence they journeyed, and pitched in <I>Ebronah:</I> from
                           thence they journeyed, and pitched in <I>Eziongaber:</I> from thence they journeyed, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin,
                           which is <I>Kadesh:</I> from thence they journeyed, and pitched in Mount <I>Hor.</I> And there Aaron died," &amp;c. (Kennicott,
                           2. Dis.) --- Thus Mosera will be the 27th, and Mount Hor the 34th station; (Pococke) whence the Israelites departed, after
                           the death of Aaron, to Salmona, directing their course to the countries east of the Jordan, which had been promised to them.
                           The appointment of Eleazar to succeed Aaron, and the separation of the Levites unto the Lord, should be all placed together,
                           after the different encampments. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           during the pontificate of Aaron, Numbers iii. 6. (Menochius) --- God had made this appointment at Sinai, (Exodus xxviii. 1,)
                           where he ordered the tabernacle and the priests to be consecrated. Upon the sedition of Core, which probably took place at
                           Jetebata, he confirmed the rights of the Levitical tribe, Numbers xvi. 17, 18. (Calmet) --- <I>Ark.</I> The priests carried
                           it, on more solemn occasions, (Josue iii. 3,) as they also blessed the people. (Menochius) --- Yet the Levites sung the praises
                           of God, in which sense the word <EM>blessing</EM> is often used, 1 Paralipomenon xxiii. 13. Hence Castalio translates, "to

                           Moses does not follow the order of events, but recalls to the minds of his audience what might serve to make the deepest impression
                           upon them. He mentions some farther instructions which he had received from God on Mount Sinai, during the second term of
                           40 days. (Calmet) --- It might have been placed in a more natural order at the head of this chapter. (Menochius) --- Some
                           believe that Moses speaks of the third fast of 40 days. (Salien)</FONT></P><B>

                           The Hebrews esteem circumcision as a mark of their greatest glory. All who had it not, were looked upon as profane. They call
                           the ears, mind, and heart uncircumcised, when they would not hear, understand, or obey the law of God. St. Paul (Romans ii.
                           28) frequently inculcates this interior circumcision, to which Moses alludes in these his last exhortations, chap. xxx. 6.
                           The people had not regularly practised circumcision in the desert. Moses takes care to raise their thoughts to something more
                           spiritual; and declares, in clearer terms than he had hitherto done, the necessity of loving God. All must be banished from
                           the heart which might resist this love. (Calmet) --- Vanity, blindness, luxury, must be retrenched. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>
