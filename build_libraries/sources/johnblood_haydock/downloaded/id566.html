                           of Israel. (Haydock) --- The Jews commonly suppose that it was Phinees, the <I>high priest,</I> Malachias ii. 8. (Drusius)
                           But he might be dead with the rest of the ancients when this took place, as the Israelites seem to have experienced many difficulties
                           in consequence of their repeated prevarications, before this messenger was sent to them. He might very probably be some <I>prophet,</I>
                           who speaks in the name of God, (Aggeus i. 13,) as he is said to come not from heaven, but <I>from Galgal to the place of weepers.</I>

                           lxxxiii. 7,) perhaps received his name afterwards, from what happened, ver. 4. Some suppose it designates Silo, where the
                           people might be assembled on some great festival, and where sacrifice was offered, ver. 5. Bonfrere collects from the Septuagint
                           and Josephus, ([Antiquities?] vii. 4,) that it lay beyond the vale of the Raphaim, on the south side of Jerusalem, (Menochius)
                           where this messenger might summon the people together, and authorize them to offer sacrifice, as was frequently done (Calmet)
                           by dispensation (Haydock) at a distance from the tabernacle, chap. vi. 20., and xiii. 19. --- <I>I made.</I> If he was an
                           angel, his authority could not be called in question; and if he was the high priest, or a prophet known to the people, they
                           would hear him with attention and respect. (Calmet) --- He appeared at least in human form, and spoke in the name of God.

                           None of a public nature had been perhaps made by the whole nation, to sanction the idolatry of the Chanaanites. But so many
                           individuals had entered into marriages with them and imitated their perverse manners, so many tribes had spared the cities,
                           &amp;c., that the Israelites in general merited the reprimand. Whether these leagues, made in contradiction to God's command,
                           were to be observed or broken, is a matter of dispute. We may steer a middle course, and assert that such agreements as stipulated
                           the protection of the idolatrous worship and <I>altars,</I> were null, and never to be observed; whereas those which secured
                           to the inhabitants their lives and property, could not be lawfully broken, though the contractors did wrong in making such
                           leagues. See 1 Esdras ix. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           Septuagint, "stumbling block," the occasion of ruin. (Menochius) --- Thus by a false compassion (Calmet) and negligence, the
                           Israelites brought upon themselves the most serious difficulties, while those whom they had spared, turned against them by
                           a just judgment of God, and proved the ruin both of their souls and bodies, by drawing them into idolatry and then putting

                           and temple were appointed for such sacrifices, though they might be offered elsewhere by dispensation. (St. Augustine, q.

                           way of an introduction to that which follows. (Challoner) --- The sacred penman gives a short description of the general conduct
                           of the Israelites, shewing how they abandoned their former fidelity, after Josue and the elders were no more, and in consequence
                           were severely punished. Upon their repentance, God shewed them mercy again and again, as will be explained more at large (Haydock)
                           in the subsequent chapters. Salien and some others have hence inferred, that Josue was living when the angel made this reproach.
                           (Calmet) --- But that is contradicted by many passages in the Book of Josue, where the fidelity of the people is commended,
                           as well as here, ver. 7; and chap. i., we read of the death of Josue, so that St. Augustine (q. 14,) says, "there can be no
                           doubt but this is a recapitulation." (Menochius) --- As little had been said before, to enable us to see the grounds of the
                           accusation, these few remarks are subjoined to justify the words of the angel, who appeared while the people was groaning
                           under the afflictions which their sins had deserved. (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           them: for the succession of the true church and religion was kept up all this time by the priest and Levites, at least in

                           Hebrew, "any." Septuagint, "a man of those nations," which must be understood, unless the Israelites return to a proper sense
                           of their duty. For then he destroyed not only individuals, but whole armies, by the hand of the judges. Yet we do not find
                           that such havoc was made among the infidels afterwards, as had been made in the days of Josue. They frequently rose up and
                           harassed the Israelites; and God suffered them to do so, that the latter might learn to know themselves, and might perceive
                           how dreadful a thing it is not to comply, at first, with his injunctions. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           he withdrew the sword of Josue, who would otherwise have easily followed up his victories, and exterminated all the inhabitants.
                           The cowardice and secret indispositions of the people was another obstacle. (Haydock) --- God acted like a person who distrusted
                           the fidelity of his servant, and left something in his way to see if we would steal it. (Calmet)</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT
