                           <i>Sleep.</i> Anxious what Esther could desire. Septuagint, "But the Lord removed sleep from the king that night." (Haydock)
                           --- Providence watched over the welfare of his people. --- <i>Chronicles.</i> The kings took particular care (Calmet) to have
                           their benefactors mentioned in history and rewarded. (Herodotus viii. 85.) Assuerus had not recourse to musicians, &amp;c.,
                           wisely (Tirinus) reflecting that history is the most pleasing and useful amusement. (Cicero, &amp;c.) (Tirinus) --- God directed

                           come thither with six others, when they conspired to destroy Smerdis. Hebrew, &amp;c., read, "the outward court," in which
                           Aman was, till he heard the king was awake, and called for him. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           wore it hanging backwards. Cyrus allowed his nobility to appear in purple, but he would have only his own robes striped with
                           white. (Cyrop. viii.; Curtius iii.) --- The kings often made presents of garments, &amp;c., to ambassadors, and to those who
                           were styled "their relations." --- <i>Horse:</i> 200 such appeared in the train of Cyrus, with golden bits, which none were
                           permitted to use without special leave. --- <i>Head.</i> Greek seems to refer this to the horse, which might indeed have a
                           sort of crown. But the golden one was more probably worn by the person honoured, chap. viii. 15.</font></p><b>

                           <i>Spoken.</i> The distinction was not for one day only. Mardochai might afterwards wear the tiara, &amp;c. God thus clearly
                           manifested that he would resist the proud, and give grace to the humble. (St. James iv. 6.) The exaltation of Joseph in Egypt,
                           (Calmet) and lately of Daniel at the court at Babylon, (Tirinus) was hardly less wonderful, Genesis xli., and Daniel vi. (Calmet)
                           --- We may easily conceive the astonishment which would fill the breast of Aman, as well as of Mardochai, on this occasion.
                           The Greek published by Usher, has expressed these sentiments; (Haydock) and the Chaldean has added many embellishments, which
                           are of no authority. (Calmet)</font></p><b>
