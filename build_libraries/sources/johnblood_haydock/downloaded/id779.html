                           his father of neglecting to judge, &amp;c., 2 Kings xv. 2. The Jews calumniated and sought the death of Christ, whose agony

                           <i>Storm.</i> The first fury of the rebels, which is most dangerous, is thus specified. David was convinced, that his son's
                           party would dwindle away, when he was informed that he did not pursue him, following the advice of Chusai. (Calmet) --- Hebrew,

                           as at Babel, that they may not know how to proceed. (Calmet) --- Hebrew, "swallow up....the torrent of their tongue." (Bate.)
                           --- <i>Pallag,</i> means also to "divide." Absalom was accordingly infatuated by David's friend, 2 Kings xv. 31., and xvii.

                           been long (Calmet) secretly disaffected. See 2 Kings xv. 12., and xvi. 23. He professed the same religion, and was trusted

                           of God: but not by way of ill-will, or uncharitable curses, which the law of God disallows. (Challoner) --- David shewed even
                           too much tenderness towards the rebels, in the opinion of Joab, &amp;c. He would not hurt Saul. His predictions were verified;
                           as Achitophel became a suicide, Absalom perished miserably, suspended between heaven and earth, as an object of horror to

                           <i>They are divided,</i> &amp;c. Dispersed, scattered, and brought to nothing, by the wrath of God, who looks with indignation
                           on their wicked and deceitful ways. (Challoner) --- They are separated from the good, (St. Jerome) slain by a look, 2 Thessalonians
                           ii. 8. --- <i>Near,</i> or fought, ver. 19. (Calmet) --- Some translate, "they have divided the butter, like words of his
                           mouth." But this is less accurate, and the same idea is conveyed in the next words. (Berthier) --- Protestants, "<i>The words</i>
                           of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war <i>was</i> in his heart. His words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn
                           swords." (Haydock) --- My enemy has violated every law, under the appearance of friendship. (Calmet) --- <i>Darts.</i> Absalom
                           kissed the men of Israel to delude them, (2 Kings xv. 2.) and the traitor gave this sign to those who came to seize our Saviour,
                           Matthew xxvi. 48. (Calmet) --- The words of God are most excellent in themselves, but they seem hard to the incredulous. Thus
                           the Capharnaites gave rise to the first heresy against the words of Christ, which St. Peter piously believed, though, as yet,
                           he did not comprehend their meaning, John vi. (St. Augustine) (Worthington) --- His heart and words may thus be understood
                           of God: but they more probably relate to any one of David's numerous enemies, who is thus singled out. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           --- Achitophel, and many others, have been suddenly cut off. God sometimes permits such to reign for a time, to exercise his
                           servants, or that they may repent. (St. Augustine) --- The Scripture often threatens sinners in this manner, Job xxi. 21.,
                           and Isaias lxv. 20. (Calmet) --- Their <i>days</i> are indeed spent, when they die. But if they had altered their conduct,
                           they might have prolonged their life, (Haydock) according to the usual course of nature. (Worthington) (Menochius)</font></p><font

                                    <p>1 Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.</p>
                                    <p>2 Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not my supplication: 3 be attentive to me, and hear me.</p>
                                    <p>I am grieved in my exercise; and am troubled, 4 at the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner.</p>
                                    <p>For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were troublesome to me.</p>
                                    <p>5 My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.</p>
                                    <p>6 Fear and trembling are come upon me: and darkness hath covered me.</p>
                                    <p>7 And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at rest?</p>
                                    <p>8 Lo, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the wilderness.</p>
                                    <p>9 I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm.</p>
                                    <p>10 Cast down, O Lord, <i>and </i>divide their tongues; for I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.</p>
                                    <p>11 Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: and in the midst thereof are labour, 12 and injustice.</p>
                                    <p>And usury and deceit have not departed from its streets.</p>
                                    <p>13 For if my enemy had reviled me, I would verily have borne with it.</p>
                                    <p>And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me: I would perhaps have hidden myself from him.</p>
                                    <p>14 But thou, a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar:</p>
                                    <p>15 Who didst take sweet meats together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent.</p>
                                    <p>16 Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell.</p>
                                    <p>For there is wickedness in their dwellings: in the midst of them.</p>
                                    <p>17 But I have cried to God: and the Lord will save me.</p>
                                    <p>18 Evening and morning, and at noon, I will speak and declare: and he shall hear my voice.</p>
                                    <p>19 He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: for among many they were with me.</p>
                                    <p>20 God shall hear, and the Eternal shall humble them.</p>
                                    <p>For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God: 21 he hath stretched forth his hand to repay.</p>
                                    <p>They have defiled his covenant, 22 they are divided by the wrath of his countenance, and his heart hath drawn near.</p>
                                    <p>His words are smoother than oil, and the same are darts.</p>
                                    <p>23 *Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever.</p>
                                    <p>24 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction.</p>
                                    <p>Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days: but I will trust in thee, O Lord.</p></font></font>
