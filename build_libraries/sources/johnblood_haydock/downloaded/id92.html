                           <i>In the beginning was the word:</i>[1] or rather, <i>the word was in the beginning.</i> The eternal <i>word,</i> the increated[uncreated?]
                           <i>wisdom,</i> the second <i>Person</i> of the blessed Trinity, the <i>only begotten Son</i> of the Father, as he is here
                           called (ver. 14.) of the <i>same nature</i> and <i>substance,</i> and the <i>same God,</i> with the Father and Holy Ghost.
                           This word <i>was always;</i> so that it was never true to say, <i>he was not,</i> as the Arians blasphemed. This word was
                           <i>in the beginning.</i> Some, by the <i>beginning,</i> expound the Father himself, in whom he was always. Others give this
                           plain and obvious sense, that the word, or the Son of God, was, when all other things began to have a being; he never began,
                           but was from all eternity. --- <i>And the word was with God;</i> i.e. was with the Father; and as it is said, (ver. 18) <i>in
                           the bosom of the Father;</i> which implies, that he is indeed a <i>distinct person,</i> but the same in nature and substance
                           with the Father and the Holy Ghost. This is repeated again in the second verse, as repetitions are very frequent in St. John.
                           --- <i>And the word was God.</i> This without question is the construction; where, according to the letter we read, <i>and
                           God was the word.</i> (Witham) --- The Greek for the <i>word</i> is&nbsp;<i><u>Logos</u>,</i> which signifies not only the
                           exterior word, but also the interior word, or thought; and in this latter sense it is taken here. (Bible de Vence) --- Philo
                           Judæus, in the apostolic age, uses the word&nbsp;<i><u>Logos</u>,</i> p. 823, to personify the wisdom and the power of God.&nbsp;</font><font
                           face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3"><i><u>Logos estin eikon Theou di ou sumpas o Kosmos edemiourgeito</u>.</i> By
                           a similar metonymy, Jesus Christ is called the way, the truth, the life, the resurrection. --- <i>And the word was God.</i>
                           Here the eternity and the divinity of the second Person are incontrovertibly established; or, we must say that language has
                           no longer a fixed meaning, and that it is impossible to establish any point whatever from the words of Scripture. (Haydock)</font></p><b>

                           <i>The same was in the beginning with God.</i> In the text is only, "this was in the beginning;" but the sense and construction

                           <i>All things were made by him,</i>[2]<i> and without him was made nothing that was made.</i> These words teach us, that all
                           <i>created being, visible, </i>or<i> invisible</i> on earth, every thing that ever <i>was made,</i> or began to be, were <i>made,</i>
                           produced, and created by this eternal word, or by the Son of God. The same is truly said of the Holy Ghost; all creatures
                           being equally produced, <i>created,</i> and <i>preserved</i> by the three divine Persons as, by their <i>proper, principal,</i>
                           and <i>efficient</i> cause, in the same manner, and by the same action: not by the Son, in any manner inferior to the Father;
                           nor as if the Son produced things only <i>ministerially,</i> and acted only as the <i>minister,</i> and <i>instrument</i>
                           of the Father, as the Arians pretended. In this sublime mystery of one God and three distinct Persons, if we consider the
                           <i>eternal processions,</i> and <i>personal proprieties,</i> the Father is the <i>first Person,</i> but not by any <i>priority
                           of time,</i> or <i>of dignity;</i> all the three divine Persons being <i>eternal,</i> or <i>co-eternal, equal</i> in all perfections,
                           being one in nature, in substance, in power, in majesty: in a word, one and the same God. The <i>Father</i> in no other sense
                           is called <i>the first Person,</i> but because he proceeds from none, or from no other person: and the eternal Son is the
                           second Person begotten, and proceeding from him, the Father, from all eternity, proceeds now, and shall proceed from him for
                           all eternity; as we believe that the <i>third divine Person,</i> the <i>Holy Ghost,</i> always <i>proceeded</i> without any
                           beginning, doth <i>now proceed,</i> and <i>shall proceed</i> for ever, both from the Father and the Son. But when we consider
                           and speak of any creatures, of any thing that was made, or had a beginning, all things were <i>equally created</i> in time,
                           and are <i>equally preserved,</i> no less by the <i>Son,</i> and by the <i>Holy Ghost,</i> than by the <i>Father.</i> For
                           this reason St. John tells us again in this chapter, (ver. 10.) that <i>the world was made by </i>the word. And our Saviour
                           himself (John v. 19.) tells us, <i>that whatsoever the Father doth, these things also in like manner,</i> or in the same manner,
                           <i>the Son doth.</i> Again the apostle, (Hebrews i. ver. 2.) speaking of the <i>Son,</i> says, the <i>world was made by him:</i>
                           and in the same chapter, (ver. 10.) he applies to <i>the Son</i> these words, (Psalm ci. 26.) <i>And thou, O Lord, in the
                           </i>beginning didst found the earth: and the heavens are the <i>works of thy hands,</i> &amp;c. To omit other places, St.
                           Paul again, writing to the Colossians, (Chap. i. ver. 16, 17.) and speaking of <i>God's beloved Son,</i> as may be seen in
                           that chapter, says, that <i>in him all things were created, visible and invisible---all things were created in him, and by
                           him,</i> or, as it is in the Greek, <i>unto him,</i> and <i>for him;</i> to shew that the Son was not only the efficient cause,
                           the <i>Maker</i> and <i>Creator</i> of all things, but also the last end of all. Which is also confirmed by the following
                           words: <i>And he is before all, and all things subsist in him,</i> or <i>consist in him;</i> as in the Rheims and Protestant
                           translations. I have, therefore, in this third verse, translated, <i>all things were made by him,</i> with all English translations
                           and paraphrases, whether made by Catholics or Protestants; and not <i>all things were made through him,</i> lest <i>through</i>
                           should seem to carry with it a different and a <i>diminishing signification;</i> or as if, in the creation of the world, the
                           eternal <i>word,</i> or the <i>Son of God,</i> produced things only <i>ministerially,</i> and, in a manner, inferior to the
                           Father, as the Arians and Eunomians pretended; against whom, on this very account, wrote St. Basil, lib. de spiritu Sto. St.
                           Chrysostom, and St. Cyril, on this very verse; where they expressly undertake to shew that the Greek text in this verse no
                           ways favours these heretics. The <i>Arians,</i> and now the <i>Socinians,</i> who deny the Son to be <i>true God,</i> or that
                           the <i>word God</i> applies as properly to him as to the Father, but would have him called God, that is, a <i>nominal god,</i>
                           in an inferior and improper sense; as when Moses called the <i>god of Pharao;</i> (Exodus vii. 1.) or as men in authority
                           are called <i>gods;</i> (Psalm lxxxi. 6.) pretend, after Origen, to find another difference in the Greek text; as if, when
                           mention is made of the Father, he is styled <i>the God;</i> but that the Son is only called <i>God,</i> or <i>a God.</i> This
                           objection St. Chrysostom, St. Cyril, and others, have shewn to be groundless: that pretended significant <i>Greek article</i>
                           being several times omitted, when the word <i>God</i> is applied to God the Father; and being found in other places, when
                           the Son of God is called God. See this objection fully and clearly answered by the author of a short book, published in the
                           year 1729, against Dr. Clark and Mr. Whiston, p. 64, and seq. (Witham) --- <i>Were made,</i> &amp;c. Mauduit here represents
                           the word: ---"1. As a cause, or principle, acting extraneously from himself upon the void space, in order to give a being
                           to all creatures:" whereas there was no void space before the creation. Ante omnia Deus erat solus, ipse sibi et mundus et
                           locus, et omnia. (Tertullian, lib. cont. Prax. chap. v.) And St. Augustine in Psalm cxxii. says: antequam faceret Deus Sanctos,
                           ubi habitabat? In se habitabat, apud se habitabat. --- The creation of all things, visible and invisible, was the work of
                           the whole blessed Trinity; but the Scriptures generally attribute it to the word; because wisdom, reason, and intelligence,
                           which are the attributes of the Son, are displayed most in it. (Calmet) --- What wonderful tergiversations the Arians used
                           to avoid the evidence of this text, we see in St. Augustine, lib. iii. de doct. Christ. chap. 2; even such as modern dissenters
                           do, to avoid the evidence of <i>This is my Body,</i> concerning the blessed Eucharist. (Bristow)</font></p><b>

                           <i>And the word was made flesh.</i> This <i>word,</i> or <i>Son of God,</i> who was <i>in the beginning,</i> from all eternity,
                           at the time appointed by the divine decrees, <i>was made flesh,</i> i.e. became man, by a true and physical union of his <i>divine
                           person,</i> (from which the <i>divine nature</i> was inseparable) to our human nature, to a human soul, and a human body,
                           in the womb, and of the substance, of his virgin Mother. From the moment of Christ's incarnation, as all Christians are taught
                           to believe, he that was God from eternity, became also true man. In Jesus Christ, our blessed Redeemer, we believe <i>one
                           divine Person</i> with <i>two natures,</i> and <i>two wills;</i> the one <i>divine,</i> the other <i>human:</i> by which <i>substantial
                           union,</i> one and the same Person became truly both God and man; not two persons, or two sons, as Nestorius, the heretic,
                           pretended. By this union, and a mutual communication of the proprieties of each nature, it is true to say, that the Son of
                           God, remaining unchangeably God, was made man; and therefore that God was truly conceived and born of the virgin Mary, who,
                           on this account, was truly the Mother of God: that God was born, suffered, and died on the cross, to redeem and save us. The
                           <i>word,</i> in this manner made man, <i>dwelt in us,</i> or among us, by this substantial union with our human nature, not
                           <i>morally only,</i> nor after such a manner, as God is said to dwell in a temple; nor as he is in his faithful servants,
                           by a spiritual <font size="3">union, and communication of his divine graces; but by such a real union,</font> that the same
                           person is truly both God and man. --- <i>And we saw his glory,</i> manifested to the world by many signs and miracles; we
                           in particular, who were present at his transfiguration. (Matthew xvii.) --- <i>Full of grace and truth.</i> These words, in
                           the construction, are to be joined in this manner: <i>the word dwelt in us, full of grace and truth; </i>and <i>we have seen
                           his glory,</i> &amp;c. This fulness of grace in Christ Jesus, infinitely surpassed the limited <i>fulness,</i> which the Scripture
                           attributes to St. Stephen, (Acts vi. 8.) or to the blessed virgin Mother: (Luke i. 28.) they are said to be full of grace,
                           only because of an extraordinary communication and greater share of graces than was given to other saints. But Christ, even
                           as <font size="3">man, had a greater abundance of divine graces: and being truly God as well as man</font>, his grace and
                           sanctity were infinite, as was his person. --- <i>As of the only begotten of the Father.</i>[3] If we consider Christ in himself,
                           and not only as he was made known to men by outward signs and miracles, St. Chrysostom and others take notice that the word
                           <i>as,</i> no ways diminisheth the signification; and that the sense is, we have seen the glory of him, who is truly from
                           all eternity the <i>only begotten Son</i> of the Father: who, as the Scriptures assure us, is his <i>true,</i> his <i>proper</i>
                           Son, <i>his only begotten,</i> who was <i>sent into the world,</i> who <i>descended from heaven,</i> and <i>came from the
                           Father,</i> and <i>leaving the </i>world, returned <i>where he was before, returned to his Father.</i> We shall meet with
                           many such Scripture texts, to shew him to be the eternal Son of his eternal Father; or to shew that the Father was always
                           his Father, and the Son always his Son: as it was the constant doctrine of the Catholic Church, and as such declared in the
                           general council of Nice, that this, his only Son, <i>was born or begotten of the Father before all ages ... God from God,
                           the true God from the true God.</i> It was by denying this truth, "that the Son was the Son always, and the Father always,
                           and from all eternity, the Father;" that the blaspheming Arius began his heresy in his letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia, against
                           his bishop of Alexandria, St. Alexander. See the letter copied by St. Epiphanius, Hær. 69. p. 731. Ed. Petavii. (Witham) ---
                           <i>Dwelt among us.</i> In a material body, like ours, clothed with our nature. He is become mortal, and like us in every thing,
                           but sin and concupiscence. The Greek literally translated, is, <i>he has pitched his tent amongst us,</i> like a stranger
                           and passenger, who makes no long stay in one place. The body in Scripture, is sometimes called a tent or tabernacle, in which
                           the soul dwells, as 2 Peter i. 14. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           may perhaps be translated <i>grace upon grace,</i> as Mr. Blackwall observes, and brings a parallel example in Greek out of
                           Theognis, p. 164. It implies abundance of graces, and greater graces under the new law of Christ than in the time of the law
                           of Moses; which exposition is confirmed by the following verse. (Witham) --- Before the coming of the Messias all men had
                           the light of reason. The Greeks had their philosophy, the Jews the law and prophets. All this was a grace and favour bestowed
                           by God, the author of all good. But since the word was made <font size="3">flesh, God has made a new distribution of graces.
                           He has given the light of faith</font>, and caused the gospel of salvation to be announced to all men; he has invited all
                           nations to the faith and knowledge of the truth. Thus he has given us one grace for another; but the second is infinitely
                           greater, more excellent, and more abundant than the first. The following verse seems to insinuate, that the evangelist means
                           the law by the first grace, and the gospel by the second. Compare likewise Romans i. 17. The Jews were conducted by <i>faith
                           to faith;</i> by <i>faith</i> in God and the law of Moses, <i>to the faith</i> of the gospel, announced by Christ. (Calmet)</font></p><b>

                           he was not their Messias; who, as they knew by the predictions of the prophets, was to come about that time. John declared

                           did not imagine could be the place of Jesus's birth. But when he came to Jesus, and found that he knew the truth of things
                           done in private, and in his absence, he professed his belief in Jesus in these words: <i>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou

                           before the coming of Christ, were convinced that he was to be the Son of God; (though they have denied it since that time)

                           was a word very proper to give all that should believe a right notion of the Messias, and of the true Son of God.&nbsp;<i><u>Logos</u>,</i>
                           according to St. Jerome, (Ep. ad Paulinum. tom. iv. part 2, p. 570. Ed. Ben.) signifies divers things; as, the <i>wisdom</i>
                           of the Father, his <i>internal word</i> or <i>conception;</i> and, as it were, <i>the express image of the invisible God.</i>
                           Here it is not taken for any <i>absolute divine attribute</i> or <i>perfection;</i> but for the <i>divine Son,</i> or the
                           <i>second Person,</i> as really distinct from the other two divine Persons. And that by&nbsp;<i><u>logos</u>,</i> was to be
                           understood him that was truly God, the Maker and Creator of all things; the Jews might easily understand, by what they read
                           and frequently heard in the Chaldaic Paraphrase, or Targum of Jonathan, which was read to them in the time of our Saviour,
                           Christ, and at the time when St. John wrote his gospel. In this Paraphrase they were accustomed to hear that the Hebrew word
                           <i>Memreth,</i> to which corresponded in Greek, <i><u>logos</u>,</i> was put for him that was God: as Isaias xlv. 12,<i> I
                           made the earth;</i> in this Targum, <i>I, by my word, made the earth:</i> Isaias xlviii. 13, <i>My hand also hath founded
                           the earth;</i> in this Paraphrase, in <i>my word I founded the earth:</i> Genesis iii. 8, <i>They heard the voice of the Lord
                           God;</i> in the Paraphrase, <i>the voice of the word of God.</i> See Walton, prolog. xii, num. 18, p. 86.; Maldonatus on this
                           place; Petavius, lib. vi. de Trin. chap. 1.; Dr. Pearson on the Creed, p. 11.; Dr. Hammond's note on St. Luke, chap. i, p.
                           203, &amp;c. However, St. John shews us that he meant him who was the true God, by telling us that the world, and every thing
                           that was made, was made by this word, or&nbsp;<i><u>logos</u>;</i> that in this word was life; that he was in the world, and
                           was the <i>light</i> of the world; that he had glory, as the glory of the only begotten of the Father, &amp;c.</font></p>

                           all things were made by him. Let not any one pretend that&nbsp;<i><u>di autou</u>,</i> in this verse signifies no more than,
                           that all creatures were made by the <i>Word,</i> or <i>Son of God,</i> ministerially, as if he was only the <i>instrument</i>

                           chief and <i>principal cause</i> of all things; of whom the apostle says,&nbsp;<i><u>ex ou ta panta</u>,</i> ex ipso omnia.
                           --- Origen, unless perhaps his writings were corrupted by the Arians, seems to have given occasion to this&nbsp;<i><u>leptologia</u>,</i>
                           as St. Basil calls it, to groundless quibbling and squabbling about the sense of the prepositions; when he tells us, (tom.
                           ii, in Joan. p. 55. Ed. Huetii.) the&nbsp;<i><u>di ou</u></i> never has <i>the first place, but always the second place,</i>
                           meaning as to dignity:&nbsp;<i><u>oudepote ten proten choran echei to di ou, deuteran de aei</u>.</i> It is like many other
                           false and unwarrantable assertions in Origen; as when we find in the same commentary on St. John, that he says only God the
                           Father is called&nbsp;<i><u>o Theos</u>.</i> Origen may perhaps be excused as to what he writes about&nbsp;<i><u>di ou</u></i>
                           and&nbsp;<i><u>ex ou</u>,</i> as if he spoke only with a regard to the <i>divine processions</i> in God, in which the Father
                           is the <i>first person,</i> from whom proceeds even the eternal Son, the second person. But whatever Origen thought, or meant,
                           whom St. Epiphanius calls the father of Arius, whose works, as then extant, were condemned in the fifth General Council; it
                           appears that the Arians, in particular Aetius, of the Eunomian sect, pretended that&nbsp;<i><u>ex ou</u></i> had always a
                           more eminent signification, and was only applied to the Father; the Father, said he, being the true God, the only principal
                           efficient cause of all things; and&nbsp;<i><u>di ou</u></i> was applied to the word, or Son of God, who was not the same true
                           God, to signify his interior and ministerial production, as he was the <i>instrument</i> of the Father. Aetius, without regard
                           to other places in the Scripture, as we read in St. Basil, (lib. de Sp. S. chap. ii. p. 293. Ed. Morelli. an. 1637) produced
                           these words of the apostle: (1 Corinthians viii. 6.)&nbsp;<i><u>eis Theos, pater, ex ou ta panta ... kai eis kurios, Iesous
                           Christos; di ou panta</u>: </i>unus Deus, Pater, ex quo omnia, ... et unus Dominus Jesus Christus; per quem omnia. He concluded
                           from hence, that as the prepositions were different, so were the natures and substance of the Father and of the Son. --- But
                           that no settled and certain rule can be built on these prepositions, and that&nbsp;<i><u>di ou</u>,</i> in this third verse
                           of the first chapter of St. John, has no <i>diminishing signification,</i> so that the Son was <i>equally</i> the <i>proper</i>
                           and <i>principal efficient cause</i> of all things that were made and created, we have the authority of the greatest doctors,
                           and the most learned and exact writers of the Greek Church, who knew both the doctrine of the Catholic Church, and the rules
                           and use of the Greek tongue. --- St. Basil (lib. de Spir. S. chap. iii. et seq.) ridicules this&nbsp;<i><u>leptologian</u>,</i>
                           which, he says, had its origin from the vain and profane philosophy of the heathen writers, about the difference of causes.
                           He denies that there is any fixed rule; and brings examples, in which&nbsp;<i><u>di ou</u></i> is applied to the Father, and&nbsp;<i><u>ex
                           ou</u></i> to the Son. --- St. Gregory of Nazianzus denies this difference, (Orat. xxxvii, p. 604. Ed. Morelli. Parisiis,
                           ann. 1630) and affirms that&nbsp;<i><u>ex ou</u>,</i> and&nbsp;<i><u>di ou</u>,</i> in <font size="3">the Scripture, are said
                           of all the three divine Persons. --- St. Chrysostom says the same; and brings examples, to shew it on this verse of St. John;
                           and tells us expressly that&nbsp;<i><u>di ou</u></i>, in t</font>his verse, has no <i>diminishing</i> nor inferior signification:&nbsp;<i><u>ei
                           de to di ou nomizeis elattoseos einai</u>,</i> &amp;c. --- St. Cyril of Alexandria, (lib. i. in Joan. p. 48.) makes the very
                           same remark, and with the like examples. His words are: Quod si existiment (Ariani) <b>per quem,</b>&nbsp;<i><u>di ou</u>,</i>
                           substantiam ejus (Filii) de æqualitate cum Patre dejicere, ita ut <b>minister</b> sit potius quam <b>Creator,</b> ad se redeant
                           insani, &amp;c. --- St. Ambrose, a doctor of the Latin Church, (lib. ii. de Sp. S. 10. p. 212. 213. Ed. Par. an. 1586.) confutes,
                           with St. Basil, the groundless and pretended differences of <i>ex quo</i> and <i>per quem.</i> --- I shall only here produce
                           that one passage in Romans, (Chap. xi. 36.) which St. Basil and St. Ambrose make use of, where we read: ex ipso, et per ipsum,
                           et in ipso sunt omnia, (<i><u>ex autou, kai di autou, kai eis auton ta panta</u></i>) et in ipsum omnia. Now either we expound
                           all the three parts of this sentence, as spoken of the Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, (as both St. Basil and St. Ambrose understand
                           them) and then&nbsp;<i><u>ex ou</u></i> is applied to the Son; or we understand them of the Father, and&nbsp;<i><u>di ou</u></i>
                           is applied to the first Person: or, in fine, as St. Augustine observes, (lib. i. de Trin. chap. 6.) we interpret them in such
                           a manner, that the first part be understood of the Father, the second of the Son, the third of the Holy Ghost; and then the
                           words that immediately follow in the singular number, <i>to him be glory for ever,</i> shew that all the three Persons are
                           but one in nature, one God; and to all, and to each of the three Persons, the whole sentence belongs. --- Had I not already
                           said more than may seem necessary on these words, I might add all the Greek bishops in the council of Florence, when they
                           came to an union with the Latin bishops about the procession of the Holy Ghost. After many passages had been quoted out of
                           the ancient Fathers, some of which had said that the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father and the Son,&nbsp;<i><u>ek tou patros,
                           kai ek tou uiou</u>,</i> many others had asserted that he proceeded&nbsp;<i><u>ek tou Patros dia tou uiou</u>;</i> Bessarion,
                           the learned Grecian bishop, in a long oration, (Sess. 25.) shewed that&nbsp;<i><u>di uiou</u></i> was the same as&nbsp;<i><u>ek
                           tou uiou</u>.</i> The Fathers, said he, shew,&nbsp;<i><u>deiknusin isodunamousan te ek ten dia</u>.</i> See tom. xiii. Conc.
                           Lab. p. 435. All the others allowed this to be true, as the emperor John Paleologus observed. (p. 487.) And the patriarch
                           of Constantinople, when he was about to subscribe, declared the same:&nbsp;<i><u>esti to dia tou uiou, tauton to ek tou uiou</u>.</i>
                           Can any one imagine that none of these learned Grecians should know the force and use of these two prepositions, in their
                           own language?</font></p>
