                           days of the azymes.</I> By this we may know about the time when St. James was executed. Peter was to be reserved till after
                           the Pasch, because it was not usual for the Jews to put any one to a violent death on a festival day. They would not damp
                           the joy of the solemnity by such actions. (Menochius) --- Nothing can be more illiberal, nothing more unfounded, and unjust,
                           than the accusation advanced by the translators of the Bible dedicated to King James. In their preface they say, that the
                           Catholics keep the words, <I>azymes, holocaust, pasch,</I> &amp;c. in their version, purposely "to darken the sense, that
                           since they must needs translate the Bible, yet by the language thereof, it may be kept from being understood." See the splendid
                           Oxford edit. an. 1770. --- So far from this, we open the window, to let in the light; we break the shell, that the kernel
                           may be eaten: we put aside the curtain, that a sight may be had into the holy place; we remove the cover of the well, that
                           the good and humble may get to the water of life. If we retain certain words in the original tongue, it is for the same reason
                           as our adversaries retain others, such as Amen, Sabaoth, Alleluia, Jehova, &amp;c.</FONT></P><B>

                           is put under the protection of a tutelar Angel. (Haydock) --- St. Bernard, on these words of the psalm, <I>he has given his
                           Angels charge over thee,</I> thus expresses himself: Wonderful condescension! and truly great love! He has given his Angels
                           charge over thee, to guard thee in all thy ways. What is man, O God, that thou shouldst thus be mindful of him, or the son
                           of man, that thou shouldst look upon him! What reverence, devotion, and confidence, should this word inspire in us! Reverence
                           their presence, be grateful for their good will; have confidence in their protection; walk with circumspection; your Angel
                           is present. In every abode, in every place, respect his presence. Let us love them too, destined to be in future our co-heirs;
                           in the mean time, our guardians and patrons. What have we to fear under such guides? They cannot be overcome nor seduced;
                           much less can they lead us astray. They are faithful, they are prudent, they are powerful. Why do we fear? Let us follow them;
                           let us stick close to them; and we shall dwell under the protection of the God of heaven. If a grievous temptation urges;
                           if great tribulation hangs over you; call upon your leader your helper in opportunities, in tribulations; call upon him, and
                           say, save us, or we perish, &amp;c. (St. Bernard, Serm. in Psalm. Qui. habitat.) --- <I>A light shined in the room.</I> To

                           Does a messenger speak with the very voice of him that sends him? St. Chrysostom[2] and others on this place observe, that
                           they believed that every one, at least of the faithful, hath a good Angel. (Witham) --- "If proper Angels," saith St. Chrysostom,
                           (T. iii. hom. 7. in laud. Paul.) "be deputed by our Lord to such as have only charge of their own existence, (as Israel said,
                           Genesis xlviii. 16. <I>the Angel that delivereth me from all evils, bless these boys</I>) much more are super-human spirits
                           at hand to help those unto whom the charge and burden of the world is committed." Such persons as can believe that God permits
                           evil spirits to tempt us, can find no difficulty surely in believing that the same good, just, and merciful Creator will permit
                           good spirits to guide, protect, and assist us. Repeated proofs of both are found in holy writ. The learned Protestant commentator,
                           Polus, on this text, says: Hujusmodi visis assueverat eo tempore Ecclesia, quæ etiam novit fideles præsidio angelorum esse
                           circumseptos. The Church at that period had been accustomed to similar apparitions, nor is she ignorant that the faithful
                           are secured by the protection of Angels. (T. iv. p. 1494.)</FONT></P><B>

                           went into another place.</I> Did not think fit to stay in the city of Jerusalem. St. Chrysostom takes notice, that upon another
                           occasion, when he was delivered by an Angel out of prison, he went boldly the next day, and preached in the temple. (chap.
                           v. 19.) but there he was ordered by an Angel so to do; now to stay without such orders, would have been rashly to expose himself,
                           and in a manner tempting God. (Witham) --- Peter retired to another place, that he might not rashly expose himself to future
                           danger. It is not just to depend on supernatural assistance, when human means are adequate to the effect. (St. Chrysostom,
                           hom. xxvi.) --- St. Peter desires they will announce his miraculous deliverance to James, the then bishop of Jerusalem, and
                           to the Christians, that they might see the effect of their prayers for him. St. James had, beyond a doubt, ordered general
                           supplications to be made by all the brethren for St. Peter. (Bristow)</FONT></P><B>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And as soon as she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for

                                    into another place.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small confusion among the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And he was angry with the Tyrians and the Sidonians. But they with

                                    were nourished by him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And upon a day appointed, Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on
