                           Hence it would appear, that part of the Levites followed Juda's division, which was preceded by the priests bearing the ark,
                           (ver. 33,) while the Caathites bore the sacred vessels after Ruben, (ver. 21,) and were followed by Ephraim and Gad. But Calmet
                           observes, that the Levites, and the whole camp of the Lord, came in the middle of the four great divisions, immediately after
                           Ruben, chap. ii. 9, 17. Salien thinks, that the ark and cloud led the way, and <I>returned</I> to the middle at the end of

                           might be placed in proper order. If the ark had to return into the middle of the camp from leading the way, as Salien insinuates;
                           while it passed between the ranks of Juda, the Levites would have time to arrange every thing. (Haydock)</FONT></P><B>

                           more than usual piety; and were the same with the Essenes, according to Serarius, and the first authors of a monastic life,

                           During this time, we know not where they encamped. The first place that is specified is Tabera, or "the burning," (chap. xi.

                           ver. 17. (Haydock) --- The Rabbins assert that there were two arks; one containing the writings of Moses going before, with
                           the lawgiver, at the head of the army; and the other, carried by the Levites, in the centre. (Drusius) --- Calmet would rather
                           translate "went in their presence;" that is, in the midst. The kings of Persia always marched in the centre, for greater safety,
                           and that they might communicate their orders with more expedition, as well as to keep all in order, and observe what was doing.
                           (Xenophon.; Cyrop. iv. and viii.; Arian ii. and iii.) (Calmet) --- But the ark of God would probably go before the people,
