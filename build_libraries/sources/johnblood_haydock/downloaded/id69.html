                           thing sprang into existence. This it was that so much astonished Peter. (St. Gregory of Nazianzus, chap. xxxi.) --- The net
                           is broken, but the fishes are not lost, because the Lord preserves his servants among the scandals (schisms and heresies)

                           little removed, they could catch nothing. (Maldonatus) --- This also shews that Peter was to call in other co-labourers, and

                           was the excess of St. Peter's humility, that he judged himself unworthy the presence of Christ, and by this rendered himself
                           more worthy. So the centurion, for a similar act of self-abasement, merited to hear from Truth itself, that he was preferred
                           to all Israel. Euthymius is however of opinion, that St. Peter desired Christ to leave him through fear, lest some evil should
                           befall him, because he was not worthy of his presence. In the same manner as the widow of Sarepta thought her son had died,
                           because she was not worthy of the presence of Elias. (3 Kings xvii. 18.) (Maldonatus)</FONT></P><B>

                           himself to the examination of the priest, he might be accounted among the clean. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxvi. in Matt.) ---
                           By this our Saviour would testify to the priest, that this man was healed not by the ordination of the law, but by the power
                           of grace, which is above the law. He likewise shews that he did not come to destroy, but to fulfil the law. (St. Ambrose)
                           --- Jesus Christ seems here to approve of the legal sacrifices, which the Church does not receive; and this he did, because
                           he had not yet established that most holy of all holy sacrifices, the sacrifice of his own body. The figurative sacrifices
                           were not to be abrogated, before that, which they prefigured, was established by the preaching of the apostles, and the faith
                           of Christian believers. (St. Augustine, quest. ii. b. 3. de quæst. evang.) --- By this leper is represented the whole human
                           race, which was covered with a spiritual leprosy, and languishing in the corruption of sin; for <I>all have sinned, and need
                           the glory of God;</I> (Romans iii.) therefore he stretched forth his hand, i.e. he clothed himself with our human nature,
                           that we might be cleansed from our former errors, and might offer in return for this favour our bodies, a living sacrifice

                           Matthew says, it was St. John the Baptist's disciples themselves that objected this to Christ. Most probably both they and
                           the Pharisees endeavoured all they could to press this objection. (St. Augustine, de cons. Evang. lib. ii. chap. 27) --- Why
                           do you not fast, as is customary with all that wish to regulate their lives according to the law? The reason why the saints
                           fasted was, that they might, by afflicting their bodies, subdue their passions. Jesus Christ, therefore, had no need of fasting,
                           being God, and of course free from every, the least, disorderly motion of concupiscence. Neither did his attendants stand
                           in need of fasting, for being enriched with his grace, they were strengthened in virtue, without the help of fasting. When,
                           therefore, Christ fasted forty days, he fasted to set an example to carnal men. (St. Cyril) --- As long as the Spouse is with
                           us, we are in joy, we cannot fast, we cannot mourn. But when he has been driven away by sin, then we must both fast and weep.
