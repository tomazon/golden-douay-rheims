                           <P><FONT face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size=3>Though some in the first ages[centuries] doubted whether this book was
                           canonical, and who was the author of it, (see Eusebius, lib. 7, History of the Church, chap. xxv.) yet it is certain much
                           the greater part of the ancient fathers acknowledged both that it was a part of the <I>canon,</I> and that it was written
                           by St. John, the apostle and evangelist. See Tillemont, in his ninth note upon St. John, where he cites St. Justin Martyr,
                           St. Irenæus, St. Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, St. Cyprian, St. Athanasius., Eusebius, St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, St. Augustine,
                           &amp;c. It was written in Greek to the churches in Asia[Asia Minor], under Domitian, about the year 96[A.D. 96]&nbsp;or 97,
                           long after the destruction of Jerusalem, when St. John was banished to the island of Patmos, in the Ægean Sea. It is by some
                           called the prophecy of the New Testament, and the accomplishment of the predictions of all the other prophets, by the first
                           coming of Christ at his incarnation, and by his second coming at the end of the world. As to the time when the chief predictions
                           should come to pass, we have no certainty, as appears by the different opinions, both of the ancient fathers, and late interpreters.
                           Many think that most things set down from the fourth chapter to the end, will not be fulfilled till a little time before the
                           end of the world. Others are of an opinion, that a great part of them, and particularly the fall of the wicked Babylon, happened
                           at the destruction of paganism, by the destruction of heathen Rome, and its persecuting heathen emperors. Of these interpretations,
                           see Alcazar in his long commentary, the learned Bossuet, bishop of Meaux, in his treatise on this book, and P. Alleman, in
                           his notes on the same Apocalypse, tom. xii, who, in his preface, says, that this&nbsp;in a great measure may be now looked
                           upon as the opinion followed by the learned. In fine, others think that St. John's design was in a mystical way, by metaphors
                           and allegories, to represent the attempts and persecutions of the wicked against the servants of God, the punishments that
                           should in a short time fall upon Babylon, that is, upon all the wicked in general; the eternal happiness and reward which
                           God had reserved for the pious inhabitants of Jerusalem, that is, for his faithful servants, after their short trials and
                           tribulations of this mortal life. In the mean time we meet with many profitable instructions and admonitions, which we may
                           easily enough understand; but we have no certainty, when we apply these predictions to particular events; for as St. Jerome
                           takes notice, the Apocalypse has as many mysteries as words, or rather mysteries in every word. <I>Apocalypsis Joannis tot
                           habet sacramenta quot verba....parum dixi, in verbis singulis multiplices latent intelligentiæ</I>. (Ep. ad Paulin. t. iv.,
                           p. 574. Edit. Benedict.) (Witham) --- In the first, second, and third chapters of this book are contained instructions and
                           admonitions which St. John was commanded to write to the seven bishops of the churches in Asia. And in the following chapters,
                           to the end, are contained prophecies of things that are to come to pass in the Church of Christ, particularly towards the
                           end of the world, in the time of antichrist. It was written in Greek, in the island of Patmos, where St. John was in banishment
                           by order of the cruel emperor Domitian, about sixty-four years after our Lord's ascension. (Challoner) --- This is the last
                           in order of the sacred writings, and contains, in twenty-two chapters, revelations, as the name imports, extremely obscure
                           it must be acknowledged, yet undoubtedly of</FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size=3>&nbsp;the utmost importance
                           to the Christian Church, if we may judge from the dignity of the author, who was the beloved disciple, or the grandeur and
                           majesty of the ideas, which pervade every chapter of the work. Being a <I>sealed book,</I> or a hidden mystery, in the beginning
                           of the Church, when nothing of this important prophecy had yet been fulfilled, it is no wonder we are deprived of the usual
                           lights which we have hitherto followed in expounding the Scripture, viz. the works of the fathers. So little was it indeed
                           understood at that time, that by many it was long considered as a <I>reverie,</I> and an extravagant composition, though the
                           most learned always looked upon it as an inspired work. One reason, which may have led the faithful to class this among the
                           apocryphal works, was the number of fables and illusions published by the misguided piety of the ignorant. We know at least,
                           that on account of the heresy of Cerinthus, which was filled up with illusion and fanaticism, this book was not circulated
                           among the faithful: a few copies were kept with care in the archives of the Churches, to be perused only by the bishop, or
                           such as he thought not likely to abuse it. With regard to the interpretation of it, it will not be expected that it should
                           be attempted in a work of this kind. We shall therefore only give a short account of the principal commentators, and their
                           plans, that the enlightened reader may consult their works, if he wish to enter deeper into the subject. But it should never
                           be forgotten, that the connection of sublime and prophetical ideas which compose this work, has at all times been a labyrinth,
                           in which the greatest geniuses have lost themselves, and a rock on which most commentators have split, the great Sir Isaac
                           Newton not excepted. Hence Scaliger's praise of Calvin; Calvinus sapuit, quia non scripsit in Apocalypsim. <STRONG>1.</STRONG>
                           The fathers living before the accomplishment of the events, have of course given us no interpretation. Those, therefore, who
                           have written on it at all, have explained it in a mere moral sense, and drawn from it useful parables and instructions. None
                           of them have given a regular systematic explanation. It must, however, be observed, as a circumstance of some moment, that
                           many of them, particularly Sts. Augustine and Jerome, thought the Apocalypse contained prophecies regarding the <I>whole time</I>
                           of the existence of the Church of Christ, till its triumphant state in the new Jerusalem. <STRONG>2.</STRONG> Among the moderns
                           we have abundant interpreters of the Apocalypse in all the reformed Churches. It has indeed grown into a mania among them,
                           the only difference being their respective degrees of absurdity. This has been to all of them the common quarry, whence they
                           have hewn the stones to cast at their mother Church. For to this day they have continued to disgrace themselves and Christianity,
                           by depicting the Church of Rome as the scarlet w---e[whore] of Babylon, popery the beast, and the pope antichrist. We must,
                           however, except Grotius and Hammond, who have given historical interpretations, and some few others. <STRONG>3.</STRONG> Among
                           Catholic expositors stands eminently conspicuous the learned bishop of Meaux, Bosseut. This light of the Galican Church has
                           improved upon and filled up the outlines which Grotius had only sketched. The first three chapters, according to him, regard
                           only the Churches of Asia, to which they are addressed; the other chapters, to nineteen, have been fulfilled in the persecutions
                           which the Church endured under the pagan emperors. The last three are merely allegorical of the triumphs which the Church
                           finally gained over her persecutors. <STRONG>4.</STRONG> <I>Du Pin</I> has taken a wider range. The last three chapters regard
                           the final judgment, and the establishment of the Church in heaven. And all the chapters between the first three and last three,
                           are mere general descriptions of persecutions, fall of tyrants, heresies, &amp;c. which shall happen in the Church; represented
                           under the various figures which the rich imagination of St. John supplied. This system certainly removes all difficulties
                           at once, by saving the trouble of comparing each figure with corresponding historical facts; but substitutes a vague and indeterminate
                           sense, which we do not expect in prophecy. <STRONG>5.</STRONG> <I>Calmet</I> does not vary a great deal in the outlines with
                           Bossuet; but their applications of the text to the history are in many points widely different. He conceives the intermediate
                           chapters between the first three and last three to have been fulfilled in the general persecution begun by Diocletian, in
                           303[A.D. 303], and the destruction of Rome, in 410, by Alaric. The last three chapters give the triumph of the martyrs at
                           that period, as well as many things, which are to take place at the coming of antichrist, and the dissolution of the world.
                           <STRONG>6.</STRONG> Conceiving that all the above commentators had too much contracted the time for the accomplishment of
                           the prophecy, by limiting it to the establishment of Christianity, <I>Monsieur de la Chetardie</I> established a new system
                           upon the supposition that the Apocalypse includes the whole history of Christ's Church upon earth. In doing this, he had the
                           authority of St. Augustine, and other fathers. Observing, therefore, upon an attentive perusal of this work, that there were
                           seven seals, seven trumpets, seven vials, and that at the opening of each seal a new revelation was made, he ingeniously concluded,
                           that the history of the whole Church was divided into seven periods or ages, and that to each period belonged one seal, one
                           trumpet, and one vial. Six of these periods he conceives to be already accomplished, the seventh yet remains concealed in
                           the womb of futurity. <STRONG>7.</STRONG> Ingenious as is this system of Chetardie, it was not adopted, since Calmet, who
                           wrote after him, preferred his own, which resembled that of Bossuet. It has, however, been renewed by the late bishop Walmsley,
                           under the name of Signor Pastorini, who has taken up the idea and general outline from Chetardie, but illustrated the same
                           with his own interpretation and application to historical facts. The erudition with which the latter author has clothed this
                           system, and the striking aptness of his comparisons of the words of the prophecy to the events which have passed, have gained
                           a very general approbation, and he is almost exclusively followed in the interpretation of this sealed book. How far he has
                           succeeded in his explanation of the seventh age of the Church, cannot be determined by us, since it is shut up in the dark
                           recess of futurity. Posterity will decide. To him we refer the English reader for any further information on the subject,
                           convinced that his researches will be amply gratified, his education wonderfully improved. For, says the illustrious prelate
                           Bossuet, "notwithstanding the obscurities of this book, we experience in its perusal an impression so sweet, and at the same
                           time so magnificent, of the majesty of God; such sublime ideas present themselves of the mystery of Jesus Christ, such noble
