                           but St. Chrysostom and others expound it of the Jewish fast of expiation, in their seventh month, Tisri, answering to our
                           September or October. (Witham) --- Most interpreters understand this of the solemn fast of expiation, mentioned in Leviticus
                           (xvi. 29. and xxiii. 27.) which fell about the end of September and beginning of October. At this time sailing on the Mediterranean
                           is dangerous. Though this phrase is at present obscure to us, we must recollect that St. Luke was writing for Christians,

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And they sounded, and found twenty fathoms: and going on a little

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 Then, fearing lest we should fall upon rough places, they cast four

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 But as the ship-men sought to fly out of the ship, having let down
                                    the boat into the sea, under pretence as though they would have cast anchors out of the fore-ship,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers: Unless these stay

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 And when it began to be light, Paul besought them all to take food,
                                    saying: This day is the fourteenth day that you expecting, and remain fasting, taking nothing.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 Wherefore, I pray you, to take some food for your health's sake: for

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And when he had said these things, taking bread, he gave thanks to
                                    God in the presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 Then were they all of better cheer, and they also took food.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 And we were in all, in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six souls.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting out

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">39 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a
                                    certain creek having a shore, into which they thought, if they could, to thrust&nbsp;the ship.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">40 And when they had weighed the anchors, they committed themselves to
                                    the sea, loosing also the rudderbands; and hoisting up the main-sail to the wind, they made towards the shore.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">41 And when we had fallen into a place where two seas met, they ran the
                                    ship aground: and the fore-part indeed sticking fast, remained immoveable: but the hinder-part was broken with the violence
                                    of the sea.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">42 And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them,
                                    swimming out, should escape.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, forbade it to be done: and
                                    he commanded them who could swim, to cast themselves first out, and save themselves, and get to land.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">44 And the rest, some they carried on planks, and some on those things
                                    that belonged to the ship. And so it came to pass, that every soul got safe to land.</font></p>
