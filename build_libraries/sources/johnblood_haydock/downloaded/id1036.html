                           the Persian monarchy. (Du Hamel) --- But it more naturally applies to Mardochai himself, who (chap. xi. 4.; Tirinus) was led
                           captive 80 years before, being then perhaps 10 years old, so that he would now be only 90; an age when many are fit for great

                           was uncle to Esther. But the Hebrew, Syriac, Greek, and Chaldean assert that he was only her cousin. Septuagint, "daughter

                                    being dead, Mardochai adopted her for his daughter.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 And she would not tell him her people nor her country. For Mardochai
                                    had charged her to say nothing at all of that:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And he walked every day before the court of the house, in which the

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 Now when every virgin's turn came to go in to the king, after all
                                    had been done for setting them off to advantage, it was the twelfth month: so that for six months they were anointed with
                                    oil of myrrh, and for other six months they used certain perfumes and sweet spices.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 And when they were going in to the king, whatsoever they asked to

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 And she that went in at evening, came out in the morning, and from
                                    thence she was conducted to the second house, that was under the hand of Susagaz, the eunuch, who had the charge over the
                                    king's concubines: neither could she return any more to the king, unless the king desired it, and had ordered her, by name,
                                    to come.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 And as the time came orderly about, the day was at hand, when Esther,
                                    the daughter of Abihail, the brother of Mardochai, whom he had adopted for his daughter, was to go in to the king. But she
                                    sought not women's ornaments, but whatsoever Egeus, the eunuch, the keeper of the virgins, had a mind, he gave her to adorn
                                    her. For she was exceedingly fair, and her incredible beauty made her appear agreeable, and amiable, in the eyes of all.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 So she was brought to the chamber of king Assuerus the tenth month,
                                    which is called Tebeth, in the seventh year *of his reign.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 And the king loved her more than all the women, and she had favour
                                    and kindness before him above all the women, and he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vasthi.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And he commanded a magnificent feast to be prepared for all the princes,
                                    and for his servants, for the marriage and wedding of Esther. And he gave rest to all the provinces, and bestowed gifts according
                                    to princely magnificence.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And when the virgins were sought the second time, and gathered together,
                                    Mardochai stayed at the king's gate,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 Neither had Esther as yet declared her country and people, according
                                    to his commandment. For whatsoever he commanded, Esther observed: and she did all things in the same manner as she was wont
                                    at that time, when he brought her up a little one.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 At that time, therefore, when Mardochai abode at the king's gate,
                                    Bagathan and Thares, two of the king's eunuchs, who were porters, and presided in the first entry of the palace, were angry:
                                    and they designed to rise up against the king, and to kill him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 And Mardochai had notice of it, and immediately he told it to queen
                                    Esther: and she to the king in Mardochai's name, who had reported the thing unto her.</font></p>
