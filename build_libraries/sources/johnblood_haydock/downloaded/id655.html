                                    the sister of Absalom, the son of David, who was very beautiful; and her name was Thamar.</font></p>

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">3 Now Amnon had a friend, named Jonadab, the son of Semmaa, the brother
                                    of David, a very wise man:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">4 And he said to him: Why dost thou grow so lean from day to day, O son
                                    of the king? why dost thou not tell me the reason of it? And Amnon said to him: I am in love with Thamar, the sister of my

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">5 And Jonadab said to him: Lie down upon thy bed, and feign thyself sick:
                                    and when thy father shall come to visit thee, say to him: Let my sister Thamar, I pray thee, come to me, to give me to eat,
                                    and to make me a mess, that I may eat it at her hand.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">6 So Amnon lay down, and made as if he were sick: and when the king came
                                    to visit him, Amnon said to the king: I pray thee, let my sister Thamar come, and make in my sight two little messes, that
                                    I may eat at her hand.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">7 Then David sent home to Thamar, saying: Come to the house of thy brother
                                    Amnon, and make him a mess.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">8 And Thamar came to the house of Amnon, her brother: but he was laid
                                    down: and she took meal and tempered it: and dissolving it in his sight, she made little messes.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">9 And taking what she had boiled, she poured it out, and set it before
                                    him, but he would not eat: and Amnon said: Put out all persons from me. And when they had put all persons out,</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">10 Amnon said to Thamar: Bring the mess into the chamber, that I may
                                    eat at thy hand. And Thamar took the little messes which she had made, and brought them into her brother Amnon, in the chamber.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">11 And when she had presented him the meat, he took hold of her, and
                                    said: Come, lie with me, my sister.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">12 She answered him: Do not so, my brother, do not force me: for no such
                                    thing must be done in Israel. Do not thou this folly.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">13 For I shall not be able to bear my shame, and thou shalt be as one
                                    of the fools in Israel: but rather speak to the king, and he will not deny me to thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">14 But he would not hearken to her prayers, but being stronger, overpowered
                                    her, and lay with her.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">15 Then Amnon hated her with an exceeding great hatred: so that the hatred,
                                    wherewith he hated her, was greater than the love with which he had loved her before. And Amnon said to her: Arise, and get
                                    thee gone.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">16 She answered him: This evil, which now thou dost against me, in driving
                                    me away, is greater than that which thou didst before. And he would not hearken to her.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">17 But calling the servants that ministered to him, he said: Thrust this
                                    woman out from me: and shut the door after her.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">18 And she was clothed with a long robe: for the king's daughters, that
                                    were virgins, used such kind of garments. Then his servant thrust her out; and shut the door after her.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">19 And she put ashes on her head, and rent her long robe, and laid her
                                    hands upon her head, and went on crying.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">20 And Absalom, her brother, said to her: Hath thy brother Amnon lain
                                    with thee? but now, sister, hold thy peace, he is thy brother: and afflict not thy heart for this thing. So Thamar remained
                                    pining away in the house of Absalom her brother.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">21 And when king David heard of these things he was exceedingly grieved:
                                    and he would not afflict the spirit of his son Amnon, for he loved him, because he was his first-born.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">22 But Absalom spoke not to Amnon, neither good nor evil: for Absalom
                                    hated Amnon, because he had ravished his sister Thamar.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">23 And it came to pass, after two years, *that the sheep of Absalom were
                                    shorn in Baalhasor, which is near Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons:</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">24 And he came to the king, and said to him: Behold thy servant's sheep
                                    are shorn: Let the king, I pray, with his servants, come to his servant.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">25 And the king said to Absalom: Nay, my son, do not ask that we should
                                    all come, and be chargeable to thee. And when he pressed him, and he would not go, he blessed him.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">26 And Absalom said: If thou wilt not come, at least let my brother,
                                    Amnon, I beseech thee, come with us. And the king said to him: It is not necessary that he should go with thee.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">27 But Absalom pressed him, so that he let Amnon and all the king's sons
                                    go with him. And Absalom made a feast, as it were the feast of a king.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">28 And Absalom had commanded his servants, saying: Take notice when Amnon
                                    shall be drunk with wine, and when I shall say to you: Strike him, and kill him; fear not: for it is I that command you: take
                                    courage, and be valiant men.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">29 And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon, as Absalom had commanded
                                    them. And all the king's sons arose, and got up every man upon his mule, and fled.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">30 And while they were yet in the way, a rumour came to David, saying:
                                    Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">31 Then the king rose up, and rent his garments, and fell upon the ground:
                                    and all his servants, that stood about him, rent their garments.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">32 But Jonadab, the son of Semmaa, David's brother, answering, said:
                                    Let not my lord the king think, that all the king's sons are slain: Amnon only is dead, for he was appointed by the mouth
                                    of Absalom from the day that he ravished his sister, Thamar.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">33 Now, therefore, let not my lord the king take this thing into his

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">34 But Absalom fled away: and the young man that kept the watch, lifted
                                    up his eyes and looked: and behold there came much people by a bye-way on the side of the mountain.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">35 And Jonadab said to the king: Behold the king's sons are come: as

                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">36 And when he made an end of speaking, the king's sons also appeared:
                                    and, coming in, they lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also, and all his servants, wept very much.</font></p>
                                    <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times,serif" size="3">37 But Absalom fled, and went to Tholomai, the son of Ammiud, the king
