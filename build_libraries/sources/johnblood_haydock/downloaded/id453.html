                           and separated from the common sort of people, and obliged to observe abstinence like the Nazarites, as the Hebrew intimates
                           in one word, <I>nazir.</I> All this was done to acquire greater sanctity and perfection. Septuagint, "whoever has made a great
                           vow to be very pure to the Lord," and intends thus to signalize his zeal for God's glory. The original term, means also to
                           distinguish oneself by a wonderful thing. There were Nazarites for life, like Samson and St. John the Baptist; and others
                           for a limited time, like St. Paul. Their abstinence from wine, &amp;c., lasted generally for a month, and was to be performed
                           at Jerusalem. Those of the female sex could not bind themselves by vow till they were ten years and a day old, nor boys before
                           they were full 13. (Calmet) --- The custom of cutting the hair, in honour of some god, was very common among the pagans; and
                           St. Cyril (de ador. 16,) seems to think that the Hebrews had seen it practised in Egypt, and that Moses judged it expedient
                           to let them do so for the sake of the true God, in order to divert their minds from giving way to superstition. (Calmet) ---
                           The Hebrews made vows to abstain from wine for 30 days, and then to offer sacrifices, and to cut their hair, when they were
                           attacked by any dangerous illness. (Josephus, Jewish Wars ii. 15.) St. Paul perhaps made a vow of this nature, in the perils
                           of the sea, Acts xviii. 11. (Spencer, Rit. iii. 6.) Juvenal alludes to this custom, when he observes, that sailors with their
                           heads shaved, delight in safety to recount the dangers to which they have been exposed:</FONT></P>

                           of water, after they have served already to make wine. This liquor is called secondary wine by the Greeks, (Menochius) being
                           designed for labourers in winter. (Varro 54, and Colum. xii. 40.) Grapes of every description are forbidden to the Nazarites,
                           as they either tend to inebriate, or at least are too luxurious. (Haydock) --- God deigns to give those a rule, who voluntarily
                           consecrate themselves to his service. "What do the Nazarites designate, but the life of those who abstain, and are continent?"

                           At the commencement, and at the end of the Nazariteship, the hair was cut; though perhaps a sort of crown was left at the
                           top of the head, as the 7th verse may be rendered, "the crown of his God," &amp;c. (Calmet) --- The Nazarite is under the
