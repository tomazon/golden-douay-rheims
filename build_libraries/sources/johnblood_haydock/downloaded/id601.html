                           ([Natural History?] l. xxii. ch. 7.) the gall of which is of sovereign virtue to remove white specks that grow over the eyes.
                           (Challoner) --- Other fishes have the like virtue; and as the aforesaid has no scales, and is not above a foot long, it could
                           not be lawfully eaten by the Israelites, nor could it suffice for ten days' provision, ver. 6. (Leviticus xi. 10.) Others,
                           therefore, prefer (Calmet) the sea-calf, (Brado) the hippopotamus, (Grotius) the crocodile, (Denis the Carthusian) whale,
                           (Theophylactus) sturgeon, or <i>silurus.</i> (Bochart, Anim. iv. 15.) --- But there are great difficulties with respect to
                           all these; and Fran. George adopts the sentiment of the Rabbins in favour of the pike, which seems the least objectionable,
                           as it has scales, gills, and cannot live long out of water, ver. 4. It grows to a great size in the Tigris, and its gall is

                           God subjected the proud spirits to such weak elements. (Serarius, q. 3.) (Menochius) --- Greek, "and he said to him, <i>respecting</i>

                           to their grave." (Haydock) --- If this text may be styled Scripture, it only records the opinion of Toby[Tobias]. (Calmet)
                           or what he had "heard." (Haydock) --- Many grave authors have been of the same persuasion that devils could be enamoured with

                           God?] xv. 23; Delrio, Magic. 2.) --- But this opinion is now almost entirely abandoned. Many who have testified such things,
                           may have experienced only some diabolical illusions. The devil could not love the beauty, nor the virtue of Sara. But he was
                           permitted by God to exercise his malice against those who would have gratified their impure desires. (Calmet) --- We may perhaps
                           decide too peremptorily on the nature of devils, with which we are little acquainted. As they are susceptible of pride, anger,
                           &amp;c., why may they not also give way to some subtle kind of mental impurity? (Houbigant)</font></p><b>

                           no more than God secretly permits;" (St. Augustine, de C.[City of God?] ii. 23.) and "God justly suffers the wicked to fall
                           victims to their iniquitous appetites." (St. Gregory, mor. ii.)</font></p><b>

                           to approach to the sacraments of penance and the Holy Eucharist, three days at least before marriage. The Greeks, in their

                           affected by certain bodies, as our souls are when our limbs are hurt? The angel chose this sort of usual exorcism, that those
                           who were present might be convinced of the devil&#8217;s departure. As the devils abuse the works of the creation, it was
                           convenient that they should be punished by them; as they submit to magical operations, they must feel the power of such exorcisms

                           that Tobias did not ask for the consent of his parents. But the angel reminded him of his father&#8217;s injunctions, (Calmet)
