                           &amp;c. Whence Cajetan gathers, that debts might be demanded after the expiration of the seventh year, on which the products
                           of the earth did not enable the Jews to pay any thing. Grotius also asserts, that perpetual debts might be required; and Menoch,
                           includes things<I> lent </I>under the same regulation. But all debts became extinct as soon as the seventh year commenced;
                           (ver. 9.; Calmet) at least they could not be demanded till it was expired; though things merely lent, might be taken back.

                           from ver. 11, where we learn that God's people would never be at a loss to find objects for their charity: but it is an ordinance
                           that all should do their best endeavours to prevent any of their brethren from suffering the hardships of poverty and want.
                           (Challoner) --- <I>Beggar,</I> is not expressed, though it be implied in Hebrew or the Septuagint, which connect this with
                           the preceding verse, (Haydock) "because (or save when) there shall be no poor among you;" as if the rich could not derive
                           the benefit from the remission of debts. (Vatable) --- God had made abundant provision for the poor. He might have prevented
                           any from falling into distress. (Calmet) --- But he suffered this sometimes to take place, to try the dispositions both of
                           the rich and of the poor. (Haydock) --- If they had faithfully complied with his laws, he would not have permitted them to
                           fall into the last degree of misery. (Calmet) --- He allows no public begging, which all well regulated nations discountenance.
                           (Menochius) --- The Jews carefully relieve their brethren. They gather alms, and one of the judges distributes what may be
                           sufficient for the ensuing week. (Leo, p. i. c. 14.) --- Those who refused to give according to their abilities, were formerly
                           ordered by the Sanhedrim to be scourged, till they had complied with their duty; and sometimes, things were taken forcibly
                           from their houses. (Maimonides) --- They relieve the distressed in proportion to their former condition. (Selden, Jur. vi.

                           The Jews give a wrong interpretation to this passage, to authorize usury with regard to strangers. But God can never sanction
                           injustice. He promises such riches to his people, if they be faithful, that they shall be in a condition to lend to many,
                           without wanting themselves. (Calmet) --- <I>Over thee.</I> Hence the Jews submitted to a foreign yoke with so much reluctance.

                           in public. Some assert, that they never allow public beggars among themselves, and indeed such are seldom to be seen. Yet
                           no law forbids it; and Juvenal (vi. 541,) upbraids them with begging slyly at Rome. <I>Arcanum Judæa tremens mendicat in aurem.</I>

                           term means, their wool was not to be "torn away." Bellon observes, that this is still the custom in some parts of the East,
                           as it was formerly in Italy, according to Varro. Pliny ([Natural History?] viii. 48,) also remarks, that fleece was torn off
