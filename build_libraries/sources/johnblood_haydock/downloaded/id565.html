                           Hebrew, "And after," as if this consultation had taken place immediately after the decease of their late victorious general,
                           who had not pointed out his successor. But it is probable that the ancients who governed in their respective tribes, (Calmet)
                           were only roused to this act of vigour some time after, on seeing the preparations of the Chanaanites, particularly of Adonibezec,
                           whose power became very alarming. (Haydock) --- Indeed it is wonderful how he had escaped the vigilance of Josue, if he had
                           been king during the lifetime (Calmet) of that enterprising leader. It is therefore more likely that he took advantage of
                           the lethargy of the Israelites after his death, and rose to a degree of eminence, which made the people of God consult the
                           high priest, how they were to resist his efforts, (Haydock) who was to be their generalissimo, (Calmet) or which of the tribes
                           was to make head against him. (Menochius) --- God only gave answer to the last question, and it does not appear that all Israel
                           was engaged in this war. After the defeat of the king, the different tribes might easily have subdued the enemies who held
                           possession of part of their territory, if they had been vigorous.</FONT></P><B>

                           by the mouth of Phinees, (Josephus, [Antiquities?] v. 2,) who had succeeded Eleazar in the pontificate. The latter survived
                           Josue some little time, so that this must have happened some time later. Le Clerc offers violence to the text, when he asserts
                           that the war against Adonibezec took place under the government of Josue. --- <I>Juda.</I> Some suppose that this is the name
                           of the leader: but most people conclude from the sequel, that it designated the tribe. (Calmet) --- This first judge was of
                           this tribe, but not all of them. The manner of consulting the Lord was by the high priest praying before the tabernacle, Exodus
                           xxix. (Worthington)</FONT></P><B>

                           They had the same mother, Lia, and were intermixed in the same country. The two tribes unite both for the public and their
                           own private advantage. The king whom they attacked first, did not dwell in the territory of Juda, as the others did, whom
                           they defeated in this chapter.</FONT></P><B>

                           This name denotes "a countryman," as the former does "a merchant." None of the children of Chanaan were of this appellation,
                           Genesis x. 15. The people of the country assembled therefore at <I>Bezec,</I> where Saul called a rendezvous when he was going
                           to attack Jabes, and which seems to have been near the Jordan, 17 miles from Sichem. (Eusebius; St. Jerome) --- It signifies
                           "lightning." A place of this name lies to the west of Bethlehem. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           "Lord of Bezec." The cruelty of this tyrant, and the oppression which he probably made some of the Israelites suffer, roused
                           their attention, and they treated him as he had treated others. He had perhaps recourse to such a cruel expedient, to disable
                           his enemies from ever entering the lists against him afterwards, as the Athenians, who cut off the fingers of the inhabitants
                           of Egina, that these islanders might not dispute with them the empire of the sea. (Cicero, Offic. 3.) Some have thus maimed
                           themselves that they might be exempted from going to war, a practice not unusual among the Romans; and the Italian word <I>poltron,
                           </I>signifies one whose fingers are cut off, as it was supposed, out of cowardice. David ordered the hands and the feet of
                           the murderers of Isboseth to be cut off, and this sort of punishment is common in the eastern countries. Eight hundred Greeks
                           who had been treated in this manner by the Persians, presented themselves to Alexander, at Persepolis, to implore his protection.

                           He obliged them to feed, like dogs, of what he threw down from his splendid table. Thus Sesostris made the kings whom he had

                           again, (Challoner) or perhaps the villages and territory were only seized by Juda; the cities being too well defended. Josue
                           had not attacked them, Josue xii. 3. Josephus says that only Ascalon and Azotus, in the plain, fell into the hands of the
                           Israelites; and the Roman Septuagint reads with a negation, (Calmet) which is inserted by Grabe in his edition as an interpolation,
                           or as a peculiarity of the Alexandrian manuscripts, "and Juda did <STRONG>[</STRONG>not<STRONG>]</STRONG> possess Gaza with
                           its dependencies, and Ascalon....and Accaron....and Azotus, with its fields around." (Haydock) --- The situation of Gaza,
                           Ascalon and Accaron in the plain, would seem to secure them from being captured, ver. 19. St. Augustine and Procopius admit
                           the negation. But the original and all the versions reject it, so that the children of Juda must have had possession of these
                           cities at least for a short time. (Calmet) See chap. xv., and xvi., and 1 Kings vi. 17. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>
