                           Many suppose the rivulet of Rinocorura is meant. (Menochius) --- But it seems more probable that the Nile, the only <I>river

                           belonged to Egypt; and though some assert that the Hebrews never dwelt to the west of it, the territory was so barren, that
                           nothing may be said respecting that affair. We find, however, that under Solomon they inhabited as far as the river of Egypt;
                           (1 Paralipomenon xiii. 5., and 3 Kings viii. 65,) and if they had not, God's promise entitled them to that part of the country;
                           as well as to that which extends to the great river Euphrates, though they perhaps never took possession of it. See Genesis
                           xv. 18., and Josue xiii. 3. Pelusium is commonly reckoned the frontier town of Egypt, Ezechiel xxx. 15. (Stabo xvi.) In another
                           place, the promised land extends from Emath to <I>the torrent of Egypt,</I> (1 Kings viii. 55,) or <I>of the desert,</I> Amos

                           the straits of Gibraltar to Pelusium, so as to comprise all the islands and the waters of the Mediterranean. (Selden, Marc.
                           Claus. i. 6.) But Grotius denies that the sea can be claimed by any one, nor was it, even for fishing, says he, before the
                           days of Justinian. (Jur. ii. 2, 3.) (Calmet) --- At any rate, Moses here seems to mean the northern limits from the point
                           of the Mediterranean, where Libanus is situated, across the country eastward to Emath, and as far as the village of Enan,

                           It is of great importance to fix the situation of this city. Some take it to be Antioch, the capital of Syria, on the Orontes.
                           But that was a modern city, founded by Nicanor, and called after his father, Antiochus, and embellished by Callinicus and
                           Epiphanes. (Strabo xvi.) --- Others believe it is Epiphania, at the foot of Libanus, on the same river, and a distinct city
                           from Emath <I>Rabba,</I> or "the great," of Amos vi. 2. Josephus [Antiquities?] i. 7, (Calmet) and St. Jerome (in Isaias x.)
                           seem to be of this opinion. (Menochius) --- But the city in question was most probably Emesa, of which Amos speaks above.
                           It was also upon the river Orontes, at a small distance to the east of Libanus, on the road to Damascus. This road was the
                           northern boundary. Emesa was perhaps formerly the capital of the country of Soba, (2 Paralipomenon viii. 3,) and was taken
                           by Solomon. Reblatha, or Rebla, (ver. 11,) was a part of its territory. (Theodoret in Jer. xxxix. 5.) (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           near which was the fountain of <I>Daphnis,</I> or Daphne, a word which is inserted in the Targum, though it be not found in
                           Hebrew. But Antioch did not lie on the eastern borders, and this fountain may be the same place as Enan, ver. 9. --- <I>Against.</I>
                           Hebrew, "on the east side of Ain, <I>or</I> the fountain." (Calmet) --- <I>Cenereth.</I> This is the sea of Galilee, illustrated
                           by the miracles of our Lord. (Challoner) --- The line was not drawn to this lake of Genesareth, or of Tiberias, as it was
                           likewise called, but comprised a large territory lying to the east of it, (Calmet) and given to the tribes of Manasses, Gad,
                           and Ruben, which inhabited the country east of the Jordan and of the Salt Sea. (Haydock) --- <I>Eastward:</I> the Septuagint
                           insinuate, "to the south, leaving the sea of Cenereth on the east." --- The <I>fountain of Daphnis</I> may probably be that
                           near the Semechonite lake, through which the Jordan runs. (Josephus, Jewish Wars iv. 1.) It may have received the title of
                           Daphnis, from the <I>laurels</I> with which it is adorned, like the suburbs of Antioch. (Bonfrere) (Menochius) --- It appears
                           that Moses has only in view, the nine tribes for which a provision was not yet made; and their eastern limits extended from
                           Emath, down the Jordan to the Dead Sea, so as to comprise no part to the east of that river, which was already given to their
                           brethren; (see ver. 13, 15, 29;) and thus the observation of Calmet, respecting the countries <I>east</I> of <I>Cenereth,</I>
                           will be rather inaccurate, as the line must run through that sea, following the course of the Jordan. These were properly
                           the eastern limits of <I>Chanaan,</I> which country comprised all between Egypt and Idumea, as far as Sidon and Mount Libanus,
                           being bounded by the Jordan on the east. The other three tribes were hemmed in on the north and east by the mountains of Hermon,
                           Basan, Galaad, and Arnon; beyond which, the nations about Damascus, and the descendants of Ammon, Ismael, and Moab dwelt,
                           in Syria and the desert of Arabia, so that the latter country was the eastern boundary of the promised land, taken in its
                           utmost extent. (Haydock) --- The respective limits must naturally vary, when we speak of the whole or a part only. (Du Hamel)
