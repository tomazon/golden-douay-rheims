                           --- <I>Fire.</I> Not taken from the altar of holocausts, chap. vi. 9. Whether they neglected to do so out of respect for the
                           miraculous fire, or out of thoughtlessness and inattention, their fault was severely punished, however venial in itself; (Tirinus)
                           that all might learn to comply exactly with God's commands, and not dare to explain them away. Thus we must carefully avoid
                           the mixing of falsehood with the word of God. (Theod., q. 9.) (Worthington) --- Those in power, like priests, if they be negligent,
                           shall suffer great torments, Wisdom vi. 7. They must expect to be treated with rigour. (St. Augustine, q. 21.) Estius infers,
                           from the command to abstain from wine being given, (ver. 8,) that these priests had been rather intoxicated. Josephus says,
                           they had not offered proper victims; and the Rabbins assert, that they were not clothed with the sacred garments: but the
                           Scripture only condemns them for taking strange fire. Some imagine, that no formal precept had yet been given. But had not
                           God commanded (chap. vi. 9, 12,) that the victims should be burnt with the <I>perpetual fire on the altar,</I> and were not
                           these young priests guilty of rashness in doing any thing of their own head, without positive instructions? Hence some infer
                           that their offence was mortal, and their punishment a prelude of eternal torments; while others piously hope that their sin
                           was only venial, and that it was expiated by their repentance and violent death, in which sense Philo explains <I>they died
                           before the Lord.</I> Hence they were buried honourably.</FONT></P><B>

                           that God requires a particular sanctity in his ministers. (Chap. viii. 35; Exodus xix. 22.) <I>The altar shall be sanctified

                           no wine at all in the temple. But the Rabbins admit of some exceptions. This abstinence was prescribed by any other nations
                           to their priests and magistrates in office. (Calmet) --- The intent of the law, is to prevent any mistake arising from the
