                           "When no injury is done to another, it is a great question whether a lie can ever be justified. The case would perhaps be
                           easily decided, if we considered the commandments alone, and not the examples," of those holy men who seem to have sometimes
                           thought it lawful. (St. Augustine, q. 68) But is it not better to allow that these were under an inculpable mistake, than
                           to defend one fault, because it is not attended with the guilt of another, by hurting others? Even lies of jest and of excuse,
                           are contrary to the gravity and open-dealing of a Christian; and God never speaks of lying without marks of disapprobation.

                           contra Faust. xix. 24.) If God required his people to exterminate the Chanaanites, he did not authorized them to entertain
                           any personal animosity against their persons, but they were to act as ministers of his justice. "O Lord, (said Philo very

                           Mules were therefore either brought from other countries, (3 Kings x. 28,) or they were produced by some of the same species,
                           as, good authors assert, is frequently the case in Syria, Cappadocia, &amp;c. (Pliny, [Natural History?] viii. 44.; Pineda)
                           (Tirinus) --- Spencer (Leg. ii. 20,) says, without any proof, that this law had a reference to the impure conjunctions of
                           animals, in honour of Venus and of Priapus. --- <I>Different seeds,</I> &amp;c. This law tends to recommend simplicity and
                           plain-dealing in all things; and to teach the people not to join any false worship or heresy with the worship of the true
                           God. (Challoner) --- <I>Draw not the yoke with infidels,</I> 2 Corinthians vi. (Theodoret, q. 27.) These different colours
                           were not in themselves evil, since they were used in the priests' vestments. They insinuate, that we must avoid schisms. (Worthington)
                           --- The sowing of different seeds tends to impoverish the soil. (Pliny, xviii. 10.) The Egyptians sowed various seeds on a
                           board, covered with fine mould; and, observing which sort was destroyed by the heat of the sun in the dog-days, superstitiously
                           refrained, that year, from sowing any of it, lest it should produce no crop. (Palladius) --- <I>Sorts.</I> The Rabbins say
                           of linen and wool, as Deuteronomy xxii. 11. They allow other sorts. Josephus ([Aniquities?] iv. 8,) supposes, that garments
                           of the former description were thus reserved for the priests alone. The <I>Flamen,</I> among the Romans, could not wear a
                           woollen garment sowed with thread, without committing a sin; <I>piaculum erat,</I> says Servius. These precepts were to be
                           literally observed, though they concealed a moral instruction of the greatest consequence, importing that all unnatural intercourse
                           was to be avoided. Pythagoras conveyed his instructions under similar enigmatical expressions, saying, "we must not stir up
                           the fire with a sword," &amp;c., as Solomon does likewise. (Proverbs xxx. 15 and Ecclesiasticus xii. 3, 6.) (Calmet)</FONT></P><B>

                           (Challoner) --- The pagans consecrated locks of hair, and their beard, when it was first cut, to Apollo, the river gods, the
                           hours, Esculapius, &amp;c. Some, at Rome, hung the hair on a tree. (Tirinus) --- The Arabians and Macæ left only a tuft of
                           hair at the top of their head, in imitation of Bacchus. (Herodotus iii. 8.; iv. 175.) This tuft is called <I>sisoe</I> by
                           the Septuagint who seem to have alluded o the Hebrew term <I>tsitsith.</I> See Ezechiel viii. 3. The ancient scholiast says,
                           this was left in honour of Saturn. It resembled a crown. The same custom was observed by the Syrians, (Lucian) Idumeans, &amp;c.
                           (Jeremias ix. 25.) --- <I>Beard.</I> Hebrew, "the angle, <I>or</I> extremity of your beard." These regulations would seem
                           beneath the attention of a lawgiver. But they were made in opposition to some profane customs of the surrounding nations.
                           The Jews still observe this direction, and leave the beard from the ear to the chin, (where they let it grow pretty long)
                           and also two mustaches, or whiskers, on the top lip. The Egyptian mummies have only the beard on the chin. The eyebrows and
                           other hair of the gods and inhabitants of Egypt, were entirely cut off. In mourning the chin was also shaved. God forbids
                           his people to imitate them. (Calmet) --- But heretics need not hence infer, that the tonsure of priests and monks is reprehensible.

                           Adonis or Osiris; as if you were mourning for them, in which sense the former verse may be explained. At funerals it was customary
                           to cut off the hair. Achilles and his soldiers did so at the death of Patroclus. (Homer) --- The Persians also cut the manes
                           of their horses, to shew their grief for the loss of Masistius, (Herodotus ix. 24,) as Alexander did when Hephæstion died.
                           (Plutarch) --- The Egyptians, Assyrians, &amp;c., cut their hair on the like occasions, and the Hebrews did so too; whether
                           they neglected this law, or it was rather designed only to hinder them from joining in a superstitious lamentation for some
                           idol. They also cut their bodies, Genesis l, and Jeremias xli. 5. The pagans did so, intending thereby to appease the anger
                           of the infernal deities: <I>ut sanguine....inferis satisfaciant,</I> (Varro, Servius): or to please the deceased. (Plutarch,
                           de consol.) Thus Virgil represents Anna, Æneid iv.: <I>Unguibus ora soror fædans &amp; pectora pugnis.</I> The Roman and Athenian
                           laws restrained this cruelty of women towards themselves. But in Persia, the children and servants of great men still make
                           an incision upon their arms, when their father or master dies. The women in Greece also observe a solemn mourning, with loud
                           lamentations, tearing their cheeks and hair, and reciting the memorable actions of the deceased. The Christians and Jews of
                           Syria inflict still more dangerous wounds upon themselves. The latter have always esteemed it lawful to adopt the customs
                           of the nations with whom they lived, provided they were not attended with superstition; which makes us conclude, that what
                           Moses here forbids, was done in honour of some idol. --- <I>Marks,</I> made with a hot iron, representing false gods, as if
                           to declare that they would serve them for ever. (Philo) --- The Assyrians had generally such characters upon their bodies.
                           Philopator ordered the converts from the Jewish religion to be marked with ivy, in honour of Bacchus. (3 Macchabees) Theodoret
                           (q. 18,) mentions, that the pagans were accustomed to cut their cheeks, and to prick themselves with needles, infusing some
                           black matter, out of respect for the dead, and for demons. Allusion is made to these customs, Apocalypse xiii. 16, and Isaias
                           xlix. 15. Christians have sometimes marked their arms with the cross, or name of Jesus. (Procopius in Isai. xliv. 5.) (Calmet)
                           --- As St. Jane Frances de Chantal did her breast. (Breviary, August 21.) <I>Nomen pectori insculpsit.</I> St. Paul says,
