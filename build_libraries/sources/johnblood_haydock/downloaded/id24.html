                           Before this time the 12 were called <I>disciples,</I> and not <I>apostles.</I> But now he selects these from the disciples,
                           and makes them, as it were, masters and interpreters of the ways of God to man. He sent afterwards 72 other disciples, (Luke
                           x. 1,) but these 12 only to the whole world. (Haydock) --- <I>His twelve,</I> &amp;c. Christ chose 12 apostles, that they
                           might correspond to the number of the Jewish patriarchs, by whom they may be said to have been prefigured; and that as the
                           whole Jewish people were descended according to the flesh from the 12 patriarchs, so the whole Christian people might be descended
                           according to the spirit from the 12 apostles. (Menochius) --- Others say he chose 12, neither more nor less, to correspond
                           with the 12 prophets of the old law, with the 12 fountains in Elim; and the 12 stones selected from the river Jordan, and
                           preserved in the ark of the testament. Others compare the 12 apostles to the 12 months of the year, and the four evangelists

                           not into the way of the Gentiles,</I> or among the Gentiles. In this first mission, the apostles were ordered to preach to
                           the Jews only, or <I>to the children of the kingdom.</I> (Matthew vii.[viii.?] 12.) See also Matthew xv. 24. and Acts xiii.
                           46. (Witham) --- <I>These twelve Jesus sent.</I> In this mission of the apostles we may observe three things: first, whither
                           Jesus sent them; secondly, what he ordered them to teach; and thirdly, what they were to do. As to the first, he tells them
                           not to go in the way of the Gentiles, nor enter into the city of the Samaritans; but to go rather to the lost sheep of the
                           house of Israel. We must here take notice that this commandment, given by Christ to the apostles, of confining their preaching
                           to the house of Israel, does not contradict one related in Matthew, (chap. xxviii.) <I>Go teach all nations,</I> &amp;c. We
                           observe that these two commandments were given at two very different times; the first indeed, (the subject of our present
                           annotation) the apostles received before the resurrection of Christ; the other after. It was necessary first to warn the Jews
                           of the arrival of the Messias amongst them; otherwise they might have excused themselves for having rejected him, by saying,
                           "He had sent his apostles to preach, not to them but to the Gentiles and Samaritans." (St. Jerome) --- St. Chrysostom assigns
                           another reason why the apostles were sent first to preach in Judea, viz. that having withstood the opposition of one nation,
                           they might be more prepared to hold out against the attacks, which they would no doubt have afterwards to sustain, in their
                           endeavours to convert the whole world. (St. Chrysostom) --- He forbids them to preach to the Gentiles, because it was proper
                           that the word of God should first be announced to the Jews, children of the kingdom. See Acts chap. xiii, ver. 46. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           going,</I> &amp;c. What the apostles were to preach, is the second thing to be taken notice of in their mission. We here learn
                           what it is, viz. that <I>The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</I> We here behold the great dignity to which the apostles were
                           raised, when sent to preach. For, says St. Chrysostom, they are not sent to announce sensible things, like Moses and the prophets,
                           but something wholly new, and before unheard of. They are not like the prophets, to confine themselves to the preaching of
                           temporal things, their doctrine is wholly heavenly; they are sent to announce the good things of eternity. (St. Thomas Aquinas)</FONT></P><B>

                           the sick,</I> &amp;c. This verse contains the third observation respecting the mission of the apostles: Christ not only gave
                           them power to preach, but also to work miracles, in order, says St. Gregory, that works might give force and efficacy to their
                           words, that as their doctrine was new, so their works might be new, and such as were before unheard of. St. Jerome also says,
                           men would never have given any credit to the apostles, unlearned and illiterate as they were, had they not been able to work
                           miracles in proof of the great promises they made to them of heaven. It was necessary that the greatness of their work should
                           confirm the greatness of their promises. (St. Jerome) --- <I>Gratis you have received.</I> Here our Saviour admonishes his
                           apostles not to work for the sake of lucre; but having themselves received gratuitously the light of faith, they should in
                           the same manner communicate it to others. (St. Jerome) --- St. Aquinas also observes on this passage, that our Saviour probably
                           wished to repress the avarice of Judas, who as he kept the common purse, might be tempted to increase their stock, by receiving
                           pecuniary rewards for their labours. (St. Thomas Aquinas) --- St. Chrysostom says, that the apostles were warned by this admonition
                           of our Saviour against two vices, to which they might be tempted on account of the great favours and graces they had received
                           from heaven, viz. pride and avarice: 1st. Against pride, <I>gratis you have received;</I> i.e. whatever you have received
                           is the gift of God, without any merit of yours: 2ndly. Against avarice, <I>gratis give;</I> that is, since every thing you
                           have received has been given you gratuitously; so if you make use of the same gifts for the good of others, act also gratuitously,
                           without expecting any temporal reward from them. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxiii.)</FONT></P><B>

                           two coats, nor shoes;</I>[2] i.e. provide not yourselves with another coat for a reserve, but go like poor people, who have
                           but just what is necessary. They were not to wear <I>shoes,</I> but they were allowed <I>sandals,</I> or soles with tops tied
                           to their feet. (Mark vi. 9.) --- <I>Nor a staff.</I> So Luke, Chap. ix. ver. 3: yet St. Mark says, <I>but a staff only.</I>
                           To reconcile these expressions, some distinguish betwixt a staff necessary to walk with (which even the poorest people had)
                           and another staff for their defence, which at least they were not to seek for. And the meaning of these admonitions is that
                           they were to go on their mission, not regarding whether they had a staff or not, unless it were necessary for them to walk
                           with. (Witham) --- In many Greek manuscripts we read <I>staffs</I> in the plural, so that Jesus Christ orders them not to
                           take any other than the one in their hand.</FONT></P><B>

                           for this precept: 1st. that they might not afflict those whom they left; 2ndly. that the apostles might avoid the accusation
                           of inconstancy; 3rdly. of gluttony also. (Baradicet.) <I>Into whatsoever,</I> &amp;c. Lest the apostles should be induced
                           to think, by what our Saviour had said in the preceding verse, viz. <I>the workman is worthy,</I> &amp;c. that every door
                           would be open for their entrance, he here tells them to inquire at their entry into any city, who amongst the inhabitants
                           were worthy. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxiii.) --- And since they could not be expected to know who in every city were worthy,
                           they were to be informed of this by the report and opinion of the people, that so their dignity and great character of apostles
                           might not be defamed by the bad characters of any who might receive them. (St. Jerome, in St. Thomas Aquinas) --- But, if
                           such was the rule given by Christ to the apostles, some one will perhaps ask, why did not Christ also follow the same maxim,
                           since we read in Scripture, he entered into the house of Zacheus, the publican? St. Chrysostom answers, Zacheus was made worthy
                           by his conversion to Christ. (St. Chrysostom, in St. Thomas Aquinas)</FONT></P><B>

                           from their feet was to denote to the obstinate unbelievers, that the very dust which their feet had contracted, in coming
                           to preach to them the gospel, should hereafter rise in judgment against them. (Witham) By this, the apostles were to testify

                           as the Jews were accustomed to perform some remarkable action, for some great crime committed; thus, when they heard blasphemy,

                           into the very midst of wolves, still he commands them to behave with the meekness of sheep, and simplicity of doves. Thus
                           he evinces the greatness of his power, in overcoming the wolves by the sheep, which were continually exposed to be devoured
                           and torn in pieces by them, still never failing to change the fierce nature of the ravenous wolf into their own nature, in
                           mildness and innocence. As long as we retain the nature of sheep, we easily overcome our adversaries; but no sooner are we
                           changed into wolves, than we become the derision of our enemies: the supreme Pastor, who superintends the sheep, not the wolves,
                           withdrawing from us the powerful protection of his grace, and leaving us to the misery of our own weakness. --- Our Saviour,
                           in his infinite wisdom, knew full well the nature of things; passion was not to be overcome by passion, but by meekness only.
                           Thus the apostles did, when the Jews having apprehended them, said, Have we not again and again commanded you not to teach
                           in this name? (Acts, Chap. iv.) Though they had the power of working the greatest miracles, yet they let nothing harsh, nothing
                           severe, escape them, either in words or actions. With simplicity they made answer, <I>Judge ye, if it be just to hear you
                           rather than God;</I> and at the same time shewed their prudence, saying, <I>We cannot but speak what we have heard and seen.</I>
                           (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxiv.) --- <I>As sheep,</I> &amp;c. He compares them to sheep, not only because of their innocence,
                           but also because they were sent unarmed and destitute of all human support. (Menochius) --- <I>Wise,</I> &amp;c. That you
                           may guard against the snares of your enemies. The prudence of the serpent is celebrated, because when it cannot escape, it
                           strives at least to preserve its head free from hurt, whilst it leaves the rest of its body exposed. Thus Christians, who
                           have Christ for their head, must preserve his faith and religion, though with the loss of every thing else. (Menochius)</FONT></P><B>

                           the advantages that follow from hating them as they ought. (St. Chrysostom, hom. xxxvi.) --- That is, he that findeth in this
                           life pleasures and comforts, and places his affections upon them, will certainly soon lose them. For Isaias says, (Chap. xl,
                           ver. 6,) All flesh is grass, and all the glory thereof as the flower of the field. The grass is withered, and the flower is
                           fallen. So man's glory seems to flourish and appears great, but falls away and dies before it has come to its full bloom;
                           for what duration is there in the flesh? and what stability in the pleasures of this world? To-day you may behold a young
                           man, strong, beautiful, healthy, admired, and flourishing in virtue; and to-morrow you will find him quite changed, oppressed
                           with either sin, labour, want, or sickness. (St. Ambrose) --- But if he continues moderately happy as to temporal concerns
                           till death, and places his affections on them, he hath found life here, but shall lose it in the next world. But he that shall,
                           for the sake of Christ, deprive himself of the pleasures of this life, shall receive the reward of a hundred fold in the next.
