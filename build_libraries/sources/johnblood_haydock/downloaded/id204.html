                           The Latin word is generally taken for a coveting or immoderate desire of money and riches. St. Jerome and others observe,
                           that the Greek word in this and divers other places in the New Testament may signify any unsatiable desire, or the lusts of
                           sensual pleasures; and on this account, St. Jerome thinks that it is here joined with <I>fornication</I> and <I>uncleanness.</I>
                           But St. Chrysostom in the last chapter, (ver. 19. hom. xiii. and on this chap. ver. 3.) shews that by the Greek word is understood
                           <I>avarice,</I> or an immoderate desire of riches, when he tells (hom. xviii) that this sin is condemned by those words of
                           Christ, Luke xvi. 13. <I>You cannot serve God and mammon.</I> (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           his 17th homily; to wit, jests with immodest suggestions or a double meaning, and raillery or buffoonery against the rules
                           of good conversation, scarce made use of by any but by men of low condition and of a mean genius, <I>which is not to the purpose</I>

                           there is eutrapelia. It is this that makes the mind effeminate....Far be it from a Christian to play the comedian. If this
                           were commendable, why is it left to buffoons? It is the business of flattering hangers-on, or trencher friends, of fools in
                           a play, of debauched women, but far be it from persons of a higher rank, well born, and of good breeding. If any man be void
                           of honour, void of shame, such a one is given to eutrapelia. A man will scarce find it worth his while to consult the Latin
                           translation in Fronto-Ducæus, which in this and many other places is far from being exact. I know that Aristotle, (lib. iv.
                           de moribus. chap. 14, p. 42. Ed. Aurel. Allobrog.) and St. Thomas Aquinas, the doctor of the schools, (lib. ii. Q. 60. a.
                           5. and 22.; Q. 168. a. 2.) take eutrapelia in a different sense, when it is a facetious innocent way of jesting, containing
                           rather instructive admonitions; and so, St. Thomas Aquinas tells us, it may be reckoned among the moral virtues; but then,
                           even as Aristotle tells us, it must be without all words of immodesty and buffoonery, which is against good manners: otherwise
                           it degenerates into scurrility.</FONT></P>
