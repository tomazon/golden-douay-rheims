                           Isaias, the prophet.</I> That in the ancient copies was read <I>Isaias,</I> and not <I>Malachias,</I> is confirmed by the
                           Syriac version, and also by St. IrenÄ‰us, Origen, St. Jerome, &amp;c. It is also proved from an objection of Porphyrius, who
                           says, St. Mark mistook Isaias for Malachias. In the ordinary Greek copies at present, we read <I>in the prophets,</I> not
                           naming either Isaias or Malachias. The words seem taken partly out of one, and partly out of the other. These words, <I>behold
                           I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee,</I> are found Malachias iii. ver. 1. And the following
                           words, <I>a voice of one crying in the desert: prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths,</I> are in Isaias,
                           chap. xl, ver. 3. (Witham) --- In the beginning of his gospel, St. Mark alleges the authority of the prophets, that he might
                           induce every one, both Jew and Gentile, to receive with willingness what he here relates, as the authority of the prophets
                           so highly respected was very great. St. John [the Baptist] is here styled an angel, on account of his angelic life, and extraordinary
                           sanctity; but what is meant by, <I>who shall prepare thy way,</I> is, that St. John is to prepare the minds of the Jews, by
                           his baptism and preaching, to receive their Messias. (Theophylactus) See in Matthew xi. 10.</FONT></P><B>

                           their sins were to be washed away, and there were baptized to shew their detestation of their former life. (Jansenius, Concord.

                           one mightier than himself. The Jews were not prepared to receive his coming; he therefore wisely led them by degrees to the
                           knowledge of what divine Providence had designed them; he yet secretly assures them that he is the Son of God. I have baptized
                           you with water, but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. Now it is evident that none but God can bestow upon man the

                           in Matt.) says, that Christ here accommodated his preaching to his hearers, and to his subject. The ancients differ as to
                           the length of time employed by Christ in the ministry of the word. It is most probable that he spent about three years in
                           announcing to the world his heavenly doctrines. In the first year of his preaching, he seems not to have met with any great

                           appears from St. Mark and St. Luke, that the cure of Peter's mother-in-law and the other sick, here mentioned, happened after
                           the preceding narrative, and probably on the same day. But St. Matthew does not observe this order; for having related that
                           Jesus, after the sermon on the mount, entered Capharnaum, and healed the centurion's servant, he hence takes occasion to mention
                           this and the other miracles, which he had omitted, and which Jesus had wrought at his first coming to Capharnaum. (Rutter)</FONT></P><B>

                           he spoke thus purposely, to shew us that we ought not to seek the empty praises of men. He bade him also offer the sacrifices
