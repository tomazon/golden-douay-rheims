                           respect of persons.</I> This partial respect of persons is several times condemned both in the Old and New Testament. St.
                           James here speaks of it as it was committed in the <I>assemblies,</I> by which many understand the meetings of Christians,
                           in[1] synagogues and places where they celebrated the divine service, or met to keep the charitable feast, called Agape. Others
                           expound it of meetings where causes were judged. If it be meant of Church meetings, the apostle might have even greater reason
                           to condemn such a partiality at that time than at present; for when the poorer sort of people, of which was the greatest number
                           of converts, saw themselves so neglected and despised, and any rich man when he came thither so caressed and honoured, this
                           might prove a discouragement to the meaner sort of people, and an obstacle to their conversion. But if we expound it of meetings
                           where causes were judged betwixt the rich and others of a lower condition, (which exposition the text seems to favour) the
                           fault might be still greater, when the judges gave sentence in favour of great and rich men, biassed thereunto by the unjust
                           regard they had for men rich and powerful. This was a transgression of the law: (Leviticus xix. 15.) <I>Respect not the person
                           of the poor, nor honour the countenance of the mighty. But judge thy neighbour according to justice.</I> See also Deuteronomy
                           i. 17. (Witham) --- <I>Respect,</I> &amp;c. The meaning is, that in matters relating to faith, the administering of the sacraments
                           and other spiritual functions in God's Church, there should be no <I>respect of persons:</I> but that the souls of the poor
                           should be as much regarded as those of the rich. ([Deuteronomy?] Chap. i. 17) (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           assemblies you discover a wrong and partial judgment in your minds and <I>thoughts,</I> by the high value and esteem you shew
                           to the rich on account of their riches, and the contempt you have of poverty and of the poor, when they are perhaps more deserving

                           marks paid them without any injustice or interior contempt of such as were poor, so that they took care to comply with that

                           become guilty of all.</I> It is certain these words are not to be taken merely according to the letter, nor in the sense which
                           at first they seem to represent, as if a man by transgressing one precept of the law transgressed and broke all the rest:
                           this appears by the very next verse, that a man may commit murder by killing another, and not commit adultery. And it is certain,
                           as St. Augustine observes, that all sins are not equal, as the Stoic philosophers pretended. See St. Augustine, Epist. clxvii,
                           (nov. ed. tom. 2, p. 595) where he consults St. Jerome on this very place out of St. James, and tells us that such a man may
                           be said to <I>be guilty of all,</I> because by one deadly sin he acts against charity,[3] (which is the love of God and of
                           our neighbour) upon which depends the whole law and all its precepts; so that by breaking one precept, he loseth the habit
                           of charity, and maketh the keeping, or not breaking of all the rest, unprofitable to him. Secondly, it may be added, that
                           all the precepts of the law are to be considered as one total and entire law, and as it were a chain of precepts, where by
                           breaking one link of this chain the whole chain is broken, or the integrity of the law, consisting of a collection of precepts.
                           Thirdly, it may be said, that he who breaks any one precept, contemns the authority of the lawgiver, who enjoined them all,
                           and under pain of being for ever excluded from his sight and enjoyment. A sinner, therefore, by a grievous offence against
                           any one precept, forfeits his heavenly inheritance, becomes liable to eternal punishments, as if he had transgressed all the
                           rest: not but that the punishments in hell shall be greater against those who have been greater sinners, as greater shall
                           be the reward in heaven for those who have lived with greater sanctity and perfection. (Witham) --- <I>Guilty,</I> &amp;c.
                           That is, he becomes a transgressor of the law in such a manner, that the observing of all other points will not avail him
                           to salvation; for he despises the lawgiver, and breaks through the great and general commandment of charity, even by one mortal
                           sin. (Challoner)</FONT></P><B>

                           of God and of our neighbour, which cannot be without being merciful to others. <I>Blessed are the merciful, for they shall
                           obtain mercy.</I> (Matthew v. 7.) --- <I>And mercy exalteth</I> itself <I>above judgment.</I> Some understand this as a confirmation
                           of God's infinite mercies, out of Psalm cxliv. 9. where it is said that his "mercies are over all his works;" that is, though
                           all his perfections be equally infinite, yet he is pleased to deal with sinners rather according to the multitude of his mercies
                           than according to the rigour of his justice. Others expound these words of the mercy which men shew to one another, and that
                           he exhorts them to mercy, as a most powerful means to find mercy; and the merciful works done to others will be beneficial
                           to them, and make them escape when they come to judgment. (Witham) --- Similar to this are the words of old Tobias to his
                           son: "Alms deliver from all sin, and from death, and will not suffer the soul to go into darkness. Alms shall be a great confidence
                           before the most high God, to all them that give it." (Tobias iv. 11, 12.) "Blessed are the merciful," says our divine Judge,
                           "for they shall obtain mercy." (Matthew v. 7.) (Calmet) --- And the definitive sentence of Christians, at the day of judgment
                           will be favourable or not, as they have complied in life with the calls of charity. [Matthew xxv. 31-46.]</FONT></P><B>

                           <I>Shall faith be able to save him?</I> He now comes to one of the chief points of this epistle, to shew against the disciple
                           of Simon , the magician, that faith alone will not save any one. We may take notice in the first place, that St. James in
                           this very verse, supposes that a man may have faith, a true faith without good works. This also follows from ver. 19., where
                           he says: <I>Thou believest that there is one God: thou dost well.</I> And the same is evident by the words in John xii. 42.,
                           where it is said, <I>that many of the chief men also believed in him,</I> (Christ)....<I>but did not confess</I> it, <I>that
                           they might not be cast out of the synagogue.</I> Now that faith alone is not sufficient to save a man, St. James declares
                           by this example: If any one say to the <I>poor</I> and <I>naked, go in peace, be you warmed and filled,</I> and <I>give</I>
                           them nothing, what <I>shall it profit? Even so faith, if it have not works is dead,</I> &amp;c. i.e. such a faith, though
                           it be not lost and destroyed, yet it remains in a soul that is spiritually dead, when it is not accompanied with charity and
                           grace, which is the life of the soul, and without which faith can never bring us to eternal life. In this sense is to be understood
                           the 20th and 26th verses of this chapter, when faith is again said to be dead without good works. This is also the doctrine
                           of St. Paul, when he tells us that a saving faith is a faith <I>that worketh by charity,</I> Galatians v. 6. When he says,
                           that although faith were strong enough to remove mountains, a man is nothing without charity. (1 Corinthians xiii. 2.) When
                           he teacheth us again, that <I>not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</I>
                           [Romans ii. 13.] St. John teacheth the same (1 John iii. 14.) <I>He that loveth not, remaineth in death.</I> But of this elsewhere.
                           (Witham) --- Grotius in this place makes a very candid and remarkable profession of his faith, very different from that of
                           his associates in the pretended reformation, called Solifideans [who pretend one is justified by faith alone]: "There are
                           some who say, 'My works indeed are not as they ought to be,' but my faith is firm, my salvation is therefore out of danger.
                           This opinion, which has sprung up in this our unhappy age, and recommends itself under the name of reformed doctrine, ought
                           to be opposed by every lover of piety, and all who wish well to their neighbour's salvation....no faith has ever availed any
                           man, unless it were accompanied by such works as he had time and opportunity to perform." His words are: "Opera quidem mea
                           non recta sunt, sed fides recta est, ac propterea de salute non periclitor....Renata est hoc infelici sæculo ea sententia
                           et quidem sub nomine repurgatæ doctrinæ, cui omnes qui pietatem et salutem proximi amant, se debent opponere....c&#339;terum
                           nulla cuiquam fides profuit, sine tali opere, quale tempus permittebat," &amp;c. In vain do we glory in our faith, unless
                           our lives and works bear testimony of the same. Faith without charity is dead, and charity cannot exist without good works.
                           He who bears the fruits of Christian piety, shews that he has the root, which is <SPAN lang=EN>faith; but the root is dead,
                           when it affords no produce. Works are to faith </SPAN>what the soul is to the body. See the remainder of this chapter.</FONT></P><B>

                           men will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works. Shew me thy faith,</I> &amp;c. He confutes the same error, by putting them
                           in mind that one can shew that he has faith, which is an interior virtue, only by good works, and that good works in a man
                           shew also his faith; which is not to be understood, as if good works were merely the marks, signs, and effects of faith, as
                           some would pretend, but that good works must concur with faith to a man's salvation by an increase in grace. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           devils also believe, and tremble.</I> St. James compares indeed faith without other virtues and good works, to the faith of
                           devils: but comparisons must never be stretched farther than they are intended. The meaning is, that such a faith in sinners
                           is unprofitable to salvation, like that of devils, which is no more than a conviction from their knowledge of God; but faith
                           which remains in sinners, is from a supernatural knowledge, together with a pious motion in their free will. (Witham)</FONT></P><B>

                           not Abraham....justified by works?</I> We may observe, that St. James here brings the very same examples of Abraham and Rahab,
                           which it is likely he knew some had miscontrued in St. Paul, as if the great apostle of the Gentiles had taught that faith
                           alone was sufficient to salvation. But St. Paul neither excludes good works done by faith, when he commends faith, excluding
                           only the works of the law of Moses, as insufficient to a true justification. See Romans iii. 27. And St. James by requiring
                           good works does not exclude faith, but only teacheth that faith alone is not enough. This is what he clearly expresseth here
                           in the 22nd and in the 24th verse. <I>Man,</I> says he,<I> is justified, and not by faith only.</I> And (ver. 22.) <I>seest
                           thou that faith did co-operate with </I>Abraham's <I>works, and by works faith was made perfect.</I> In fine, we must take
                           notice, that when St. James here brings the example of Abraham offering his son Isaac, to shew that he was <I>justified by
                           works,</I> his meaning is not that Abraham then began first to be justified, but that he then received an increase of his
                           justice. He was justified at least from his first being called, and began then to believe and to do good works. It is true
                           his faith was made perfect, and his justice increased, when he was willing to sacrifice his son. (Witham)</FONT></P>
