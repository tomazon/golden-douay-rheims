# Douay-Rheims

A Douey Rheims Challoner Bible with markup that allows for multiple styles of formatting.

# Why

To allow the generation of Douay-Rheims bibles with a choices for formatting.  
Using a common source that is:
* make public and copyright free
* changes are published and transparent
* change biblical texts, notes, and comments are documented as being traceable to authorative sources
* uses markup to enable optional formatting option

# Goals

  * All sources must be copyright free
  * The edit history must be available (change control)
  * All edits to biblical text, and commentary/notes/footsnote placed within bibal text:
    * Must be kept minimal -- heavy weight to editing the bible:
      * limit to fixing mispellings, missing/extra words, punctuation
      * Must be traceable to multiple sources each with an Imprimatur.
    * Must be auditable:
      * The reason for the desision must be preserved
        * with citations to authorative sources
  * Changes to markup/format (linebreak/paragraph marking, etc) that are trivilaly removed by a computer program
      * are not considered to be protected biblical text.
        * Do NOT need to be traceable to a source with an Imprimatur.
        * Do NOT need to be documents as to reason for decision.
      * should be clean enough to allow human reading/review of the marked up text
  * The format should be
    * Well documented
    * Easily parsable by a computer program
    * Readable by humans to aid in editing
  * sample programs sould be provided using several computer languages

# Initial Personal Reason

I can sit comfortably while reading my 1941 Douay-Rheims Bible
or while reading my reprint[^1] of a 1909 Clemintine Vulgate in latin.

As I try to improve my latin, I find it unweildy to sit with both open on my lap.
Baronius Press[^2] publishes a marvilious parallel bible.

But I'm looking for something more portable.

A parallel Latin / Douay-Rheims bible that:
* Has Challoner's notes
* I can read while lounging in a comfortable a chair.
* I can easily take with me as I go to the park, library, or coffee shop.
* I can keep in my bag and pull out when I find a free moment.
* Feels "right" in term of typeface and formatting

Inspired to create a English/Latin parallel bible where:
  * A pamphlet with a single book of the bible (i.e just The book of Genesis) to make it easy to keep with me as I'm out and about
  * 2 columns per page, latin on the inside, english on the outside
  * Challoner intro to the book of the bible
  * Challoner intro to each chapter
  * Challoner footnotes
  * feels reverent and classic (to me - very mush a personal preference):
    * A classic typeface (EB Garamond or Minister)
    * Dropcaps (maybe Lombardic or Lasance Initials [^3], but EB Garamond is still great)
    * Printed on a tan/cream paper

## Would eventually like:

### Haydock phamphlets

I learn a lot and keep inline with the Catholic teaching by reading the Haydock 
commentary using a reprint[^4] of a Haydock Douay-Rheims Bible.
At 8&half;x 11 inches and 5&frac23; pounds (about 22 x 28 cm and 89&frac23; kilograms)
and with a tiny typeface.  It's impractical to take it with me.

If I can find a clean and copyright free copy of Haydock's comentary, 
I'd like to print Haydocks commentary:
  * 1 pamphlet for a single book of the bible (i.e. just The Gospel of Luke)
  * Only Haydock's commentary for the book and each chapter (not the bible text itself)

### Douay-Rheims / Knox parallel translation pamphlets

Keeping comentary from both.

The Knox bible should be copyright free in 1927.
Hopefully we'll get permission to use an existing eText are a starting place 
rather than needing to scan and OCR a paper copy.

# Still worth having a published Douay-Rheims bible:

It's not practical for an individual to print a full complete bible.

Published edition have usually been carefully review and issues an Imprimatur by a Catholic Bishop.

You can find affordable vintage Douay-Rheims bible on ebay.com or in thrift stores.

## Publishers of Douay-Rheims Bibles:

Several publishers sell Douay-Rheims bibles.  
If possible, I recommend that you buy one of theme to support their continued effort to publish this invaluable bible.
