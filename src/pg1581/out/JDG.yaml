        them. They left not their own inventions, and the stubborn way, by which they
        were accustomed to walk.

        who reigned in Asor: and he had a general of his army named Sisara, and he
        dwelt in Haroseth of the Gentiles.'
      - 'And the children of Israel cried to the Lord: for he had nine hundred chariots
        set with scythes and for twenty years had grievously oppressed them.'

        judged the people.
      - 'And she sat under a palm tree, which was called by her name, between Rama

      - 'And she sent and called Barac, the Son of Abinoem, out of Cedes, in Nephthali:
        and she said to him: The Lord God of Israel hath commanded thee: Go, and lead
        an army to Mount Thabor, and thou shalt take with thee ten thousand fighting
        men of the children of Nephthali, and of the children of Zabulon:'

        general of Jabin’s army, and his chariots, and all his multitude, and will
        deliver them into thy hand.
      - 'And Barac said to her: If thou wilt come with me, I will go: if thou wilt
        not come with me, I will not go.'
      - 'She said to him: I will go, indeed, with thee, but at this time the victory
        shall not be attributed to thee, because Sisara shall be delivered into the
        hand of a woman. Debbora therefore arose, and went with Barac to Cedes.'
      - And he called unto him Zabulon and Nephthali, and went up with ten thousand
        fighting men, having Debbora in his company.
      - 'Now Haber, the Cinite, had some time before departed from the rest of the
        Cinites, his brethren, the sons of Hobab, the kinsman of Moses: and had pitched
        his tents unto the valley, which is called Sennim, and was near Cedes.'
      - 'And it was told Sisara, that Barac, the son of Abinoem, was gone up to Mount
        Thabor:'
      - And he gathered together his nine hundred chariots armed with scythes, and
        all his army, from Haroseth of the Gentiles, to the torrent Cison.
      - 'And Debbora said to Barac: Arise, for this is the day wherein the Lord hath
        delivered Sisara into thy hands: behold, he is thy leader. And Barac went
        down from Mount Thabor, and ten thousand fighting men with him.'
      - And the Lord struck a terror into Sisara, and all his chariots, and all his
        multitude, with the edge of the sword, at the sight of Barac; insomuch, that
        Sisara leaping down from off his chariot, fled away on foot,
      - And Barac pursued after the fleeing chariots, and the army, unto Haroseth
        of the Gentiles; and all the multitude of the enemies was utterly destroyed.
      - But Sisara fleeing, came to the tent of Jahel, the wife of Haber, the Cinite,
        for there was peace between Jabin, the king of Asor, and the house of Haber,
        the Cinite.
      - 'And Jahel went forth to meet Sisara, and said to him: Come in to me, my lord;
        come in, fear not. He went into her tent, and being covered by her with a
        cloak,'
      - 'Said to her: Give me, I beseech thee, a little water, for I am very thirsty.
        She opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and covered him.'

        come and inquire of thee, saying: Is there any man here? thou shalt say: There
        is none.'
      - 'So Jahel, Haber’s wife, took a nail of the tent, and taking also a hammer:
        and going in softly, and with silence, she put the nail upon the temples of
        his head, and striking it with the hammer, drove it through his brain fast
        into the ground: and so passing from deep sleep to death, he fainted away
        and died.'
      - 'And behold, Barac came pursuing after Sisara: and Jahel went out to meet
        him, and said to him: Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest.
        And when he came into her tent, he saw Sisara lying dead, and the nail fastened
        in his temples.'

        Israel:'
      - Who grew daily stronger, and with a mighty hand overpowered Jabin, king of

      - ~
      - 'And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord: and he
        delivered them into the hand of Madian seven years,'
      - And they were grievously oppressed by them. And they made themselves dens
        and caves in the mountains, and strong holds to resist.
      - 'And when Israel had sown, Madian and Amalec, and the rest of the eastern
        nations, came up:'
      - 'And pitching their tents among them, wasted all things as they were in the
        blade, even to the entrance of Gaza: and they left nothing at all in Israel
        for sustenance of life, nor sheep, nor oxen, nor asses.'
      - For they and all their flocks came with their tents, and like locusts filled
        all places, an innumerable multitude of men, and of camels, wasting whatsoever
        they touched.
      - And Israel was humbled exceedingly in the sight of Madian.
      - And he cried to the Lord, desiring help against the Madianites.
      - 'And he sent unto them a prophet, and he spoke: Thus saith the Lord, the God
        of Israel: I made you to come up out of Egypt, and brought you out of the
        house of bondage,'
      - 'And delivered you out of the hands of the Egyptians, and of all the enemies
        that afflicted you: and I cast them out at your coming in, and gave you their
        land.'
      - 'And I said: I am the Lord your God, fear not the gods of the Amorrhites,
        in whose land you dwell. And you would not hear my voice.'
      - And an angel of the Lord came, and sat under an oak that was in Ephra, and
        belonged to Joas, the father of the family of Ezri. And when Gedeon, his son,
        was threshing and cleansing wheat by the winepress, to flee from Madian,
      - 'The angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said: The Lord is with thee, O
        most valiant of men.'
      - 'And Gedeon said to him: I beseech thee, my lord, if the Lord be with us,
        why have these evils fallen upon us? Where are his miracles, which our fathers
        have told us of, saying: The Lord brought us out of Egypt but now the Lord
        hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hand of Madian.'
      - 'And the Lord looked upon him, and said: Go, in this thy strength, and thou
        shalt deliver Israel out of the hand of Madian: know that I have sent thee.'
      - 'He answered, and said: I beseech thee, my lord wherewith shall I deliver
        Israel? Behold, my family is the meanest in Manasses, and I am the least in
        my father’s house.'
      - 'And the Lord said to him: I will be with thee: and thou shalt cut off Madian
        as one man.'
      - 'And he said: If I have found grace before thee, give me a sign that it is
        thou that speakest to me:'
      - 'And depart not hence, till I return to thee, and bring a sacrifice, and offer
        it to thee. And he answered: I will wait thy coming.'
      - 'So Gedeon went in, and boiled a kid, and made unleavened loaves of a measure
        of flour: and putting the flesh in a basket, and the broth of the flesh into
        a pot, he carried all under the oak, and presented to him.'
      - 'And the angel of the Lord said to him: Take the flesh and the unleavened
        loaves, and lay them upon that rock, and pour out the broth thereon. And when
        he had done so,'
      - 'The angel of the Lord put forth the tip of the rod, which he held in his
        hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened loaves: and there arose a fire
        from the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened loaves: and the angel
        of the Lord vanished out of his sight.'
      - 'And Gedeon seeing that it was the angel of the Lord, said: Alas, my Lord
        God: for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face.'
      - 'And the Lord said to him: Peace be with thee: fear not, thou shalt not die.'
      - And Gedeon built there an altar to the Lord, and called it the Lord’s peace,
        until this present day. And when he was yet in Ephra, which is of the family
        of Ezri,
      - 'That night the Lord said to him: Take a bullock of thy father’s, and another
        bullock of seven years, and thou shalt destroy the altar of Baal, which is
        thy father’s: and cut down the grove that is about the altar:'
      - 'And thou shalt build an altar to the Lord thy God, in the top of this rock,
        whereupon thou didst lay the sacrifice before: and thou shalt take the second
        bullock, and shalt offer a holocaust upon a pile of the wood, which thou shalt
        cut down out of the grove.'
      - Then Gedeon, taking ten men of his servants, did as the Lord had commanded
        him. But fearing his father’s house, and the men of that city, he would not
        do it by day, but did all by night.
      - And when the men of that town were risen in the morning, they saw the altar
        of Baal destroyed, and the grove cut down, and the second bullock laid upon
        the altar, which then was built.
      - 'And they said one to another: Who hath done this? And when they inquired
        for the author of the fact, it was said: Gedeon, the son of Joas, did all
        this.'
      - 'And they said to Joas: Bring out thy son hither, that he may die: because
        he hath destroyed the altar of Baal, and hath cut down his grove.'
      - 'He answered them: Are you the avengers of Baal, that you fight for him? he
        that is his adversary, let him die before to morrow light appear: if he be
        a god, let him revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar.'
      - 'From that day Gedeon was called Jerobaal, because Joas had said: Let Baal
        revenge himself on him that hath cast down his altar.'
      - Now all Madian, and Amalec, and the eastern people, were gathered together,
        and passing over the Jordan, camped in the valley of Jezrael.
      - But the spirit of the Lord came upon Gedeon, and he sounded the trumpet, and
        called together the house of Abiezer, to follow him.
      - 'And he sent messengers into all Manasses, and they also followed him: and
        other messengers into Aser and Zabulon, and Nephthali, and they came to meet
        him.'
      - 'And Gedeon said to God: If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast
        said,'
      - 'I will put this fleece of wool on the floor: if there be dew on the fleece
        only, and it be dry on all the ground beside, I shall know that by my hand,
        as thou hast said, thou wilt deliver Israel.'
      - And it was so. And rising before day, wringing the fleece, he filled a vessel
        with the dew.
      - 'And he said again to God: Let not thy wrath be kindled against me, if I try
        once more, seeking a sign in the fleece. I pray that the fleece only may be
        dry, and all the ground wet with dew.'
      - 'And God did that night as he had requested: and it was dry on the fleece
        only, and there was dew on all the ground.'

        with him, came to the fountain that is called Harad. Now the camp of Madian
        was in the valley, on the north side of the high hill.

        the waters, and there I will try them: and of whom I shall say to thee, This
        shall go with thee, let him go: whom I shall forbid to go, let him return.'

        thou shalt set apart by themselves: but they that shall drink bowing down
        their knees, shall be on the other side.'
      - 'And the number of them that had lapped water; casting it with the hand to

        it was come to a tent, it struck it, and beat it down flat to the ground.'
      - 'He to whom he spoke, answered: This is nothing else but the sword of Gedeon,

      - But Zebee and Salmana were resting with all their army. For fifteen thousand
        men were left of all the troops of the eastern people, and one hundred and
        twenty thousand warriors that drew the sword were slain.
      - And Gedeon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents, on the east of
        Nobe and Jegbaa, and smote the camp of the enemies, who were secure, and suspected
        no hurt.
      - And Zebee and Salmana fled, and Gedeon pursued and took them, all their host
        being put in confusion.
      - And returning from the battle before the sun rising,
      - 'He took a boy of the men of Soccoth: and he asked him the names of the princes
        and ancients of Soccoth, and he described unto him seventy-seven men.'
      - 'And he came to Soccoth, and said to them: Behold Zebee, and Salmana, concerning
        whom you upbraided me, saying: Peradventure the hands of Zebee and Salmana
        are in thy hands, and therefore thou demandest that we should give bread to
        the men that are weary and faint.'
      - So he took the ancients of the city, and thorns and briers of the desert,
        and tore them with the same, and cut in pieces the men of Soccoth.
      - And he demolished the tower of Phanuel, and slew the men of the city.
      - 'And he said to Zebee and Salmana: What manner of men were they, whom you
        slew in Thabor? They answered: They were like thee, and one of them as the
        son of a king.'
      - 'He answered them: They were my brethren, the sons of my mother. As the Lord
        liveth, if you had saved them, I would not kill you.'
      - 'And he said to Jether, his eldest son: Arise, and slay them. But he drew
        not his sword: for he was afraid, being but yet a boy.'
      - 'And Zebee and Salmana said: Do thou rise and run upon us: because the strength
        of a man is according to his age: Gedeon rose up, and slew Zebee and Salmana:
        and he took the ornaments and bosses, with which the necks of the camels of
        kings are wont to be adorned.'
      - 'And all the men of Israel said to Gedeon: Rule thou over us, and thy son,
        and thy son’s son: because thou hast delivered us from the hand of Madian.'
      - 'And he said to them: I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule
        over you, but the Lord shall rule over you.'
      - 'And he said to them: I desire one request of you: Give me the earlets of
        your spoils. For the Ismaelites were accustomed to wear golden earlets.'
      - 'They answered: We will give them most willingly. And spreading a mantle on
        the ground, they cast upon it the earlets of the spoils.'
      - And the weight of the earlets that he requested, was a thousand seven hundred
        sicles of gold, besides the ornaments, and jewels, and purple raiment, which
        the kings of Madian were wont to use, and besides the golden chains that were
        about the camels necks.
      - And Gedeon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city Ephra. And all Israel
        committed fornication with it, and it became a ruin to Gedeon, and to all
        his house.
      - 'But Madian was humbled before the children of Israel, neither could they
        any more lift up their heads: but the land rested for forty years, while Gedeon
        presided.'
      - 'So Jerobaal, the son of Joas, went and dwelt in his own house:'
      - And he had seventy sons, who came out of his thigh, for he had many wives.
      - And his concubine, that he had in Sichem, bore him a son, whose name was Abimelech.
      - And Gedeon, the son of Joas died in a good old age, and was buried in the
        sepulchre of his father, in Ephra, of the family of Ezri.
      - 'But after Gedeon was dead, the children of Israel turned again, and committed
        fornication with Baalim. And they made a covenant with Baal, that he should
        be their god:'
      - 'And they remembered not the Lord their God, who delivered them out of the
        hands of all their enemies round about:'
      - Neither did they shew mercy to the house of Jerobaal Gedeon, according to
        all the good things he had done to Israel.

      - 'And Abimelech, the son of Jerobaal, went to Sichem, to his mother’s brethren,
        and spoke to them, and to all the kindred of his mother’s father, saying:'
      - 'Speak to all the men of Sichem: whether is better for you that seventy men,
        all the sons of Jerobaal, should rule over you, or that one man should rule
        over you? And withal, consider that I am your bone, and your flesh.'
      - 'And his mother’s brethren spoke of him to all the men of Sichem, all these
        words, and they inclined their hearts after Abimelech, saying: He is our brother:'
      - 'And they gave him seventy weight of silver out of the temple of Baalberith:
        wherewith he hired to himself men that were needy, and vagabonds, and they
        followed him.'
      - 'And he came to his father’s house in Ephra, and slew his brethren, the sons
        of Jerobaal, seventy men, upon one stone: and there remained only Joatham,
        the youngest son of Jerobaal, who was hidden.'
      - 'And all the men of Sichem were gathered together, and all the families of
        the city of Mello: and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak that
        stood in Sichem.'
      - 'This being told to Joatham, he went, and stood on the top of Mount Garizim:
        and lifting up his voice, he cried, and said: Hear me, ye men of Sichem, so
        may God hear you.'
      - 'The trees went to anoint a king over them: and they said to the olive tree:
        Reign thou over us.'
      - 'And it answered: Can I leave my fatness, which both gods and men make use
        of, to come to be promoted among the trees?'
      - 'And the trees said to the fig tree: Come thou and reign over us.'
      - 'And it answered them: Can I leave my sweetness, and my delicious fruits,
        and go to be promoted among the other trees?'
      - 'And the trees said to the vine: Come thou and reign over us.'
      - 'And it answered them: Can I forsake my wine, that cheereth God and men, and
        be promoted among the other trees?'
      - 'And all the trees said to the bramble: Come thou and reign over us.'
      - 'And it answered them: If, indeed, you mean to make me king, come ye, and
        rest under my shadow: but if you mean it not, let fire come out from the bramble,
        and devour the cedars of Libanus.'
      - Now, therefore, if you have done well, and without sin, in appointing Abimelech
        king over you, and have dealt well with Jerobaal, and with his house, and
        have made a suitable return for the benefits of him who fought for you,
      - And exposed his life to dangers, to deliver you from the hand of Madian,
      - 'And you are now risen up against my father’s house, and have killed his sons,
        seventy men, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his handmaid,
        king over the inhabitants of Sichem, because he is your brother:'
      - If therefore you have dealt well, and without fault, with Jerobaal and his
        house, rejoice ye, this day, in Abimelech, and may he rejoice in you.
      - 'But if unjustly: let fire come out from him, and consume the inhabitants
        of Sichem, and the town of Mello: and let fire come out from the men of Sichem
        and from the town of Mello, and devour Abimelech.'
      - 'And when he had said thus, he fled, and went into Bera: and dwelt there for
        fear of Abimelech, his brother.'
      - So Abimelech reigned over Israel three years.
      - And the Lord sent a very evil spirit between Abimelech and the inhabitants
        of Sichem; who began to detest him,
      - And to lay the crime of the murder of the seventy sons of Jerobaal, and the
        shedding of their blood, upon Abimelech, their brother, and upon the rest
        of the princes of the Sichemites, who aided him.
      - 'And they set an ambush against him on the top of the mountains: and while
        they waited for his coming, they committed robberies, taking spoils of all
        that passed by: and it was told Abimelech.'
      - And Gaal, the son of Obed, came with his brethren, and went over to Sichem.
        And the inhabitants of Sichem, taking courage at his coming,
      - 'Went out into the fields, wasting the vineyards, and treading down the grapes:
        and singing and dancing, they went into the temple of their god, and in their
        banquets and cups they cursed Abimelech.'
      - 'And Gaal, the son of Obed, cried: Who is Abimelech, and what is Sichem, that
        we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerobaal, and hath made Zebul, his
        servant, ruler over the men of Emor, the father of Sichem? Why then shall
        we serve him?'
      - 'Would to God that some man would put this people under my hand, that I might
        remove Abimelech out of the way. And it was said to Abimelech: Gather together
        the multitude of an army, and come.'
      - For Zebul, the ruler of the city, hearing the words of Gaal, the son of Obed,
        was very angry,
      - 'And sent messengers privately to Abimelech, saying: Behold, Gaal, the son
        of Obed, is come into Sichem with his brethren, and endeavoureth to set the
        city against thee.'
      - 'Arise, therefore, in the night, with the people that is with thee, and lie
        hid in the field:'
      - And betimes in the morning, at sun rising, set upon the city, and when he
        shall come out against thee, with his people, do to him what thou shalt be
        able.
      - Abimelech, therefore, arose with all his army, by night, and laid ambushes
        near Sichem in four places.
      - And Gaal, the son of Obed, went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate
        of the city. And Abimelech rose up, and all his army with him, from the places
        of the ambushes.
      - 'And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul: Behold, a multitude cometh
        down from the mountains. And he answered him: Thou seest the shadows of the
        mountains as if they were the heads of men, and this is thy mistake.'
      - 'Again Gaal said: Behold, there cometh people down from the midst of the land,
        and one troop cometh by the way that looketh towards the oak.'
      - 'And Zebul said to him: Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst: Who
        is Abimelech, that we should serve him? Is not this the people which thou
        didst despise? Go out, and fight against him.'
      - So Gaal went out, in the sight of the people of Sichem, and fought against
        Abimelech,
      - 'Who chased and put him to flight, and drove him to the city: and many were
        slain of his people, even to the gate of the city:'
      - 'And Abimelech sat down in Ruma: but Zebul drove Gaal, and his companions,
        out of the city, and would not suffer them to abide in it.'
      - So the day following the people went out into the field. And it was told to
        Abimelech,
      - And he took his army, and divided it into three companies, and laid ambushes
        in the fields. And seeing that the people came out of the city, he arose,
        and set upon them,
      - 'With his own company, assaulting and besieging the city: whilst the two other
        companies chased the enemies that were scattered about the field.'
      - 'And Abimelech assaulted the city all that day: and took it, and killed the
        inhabitants thereof, and demolished it, so that he sowed salt in it.'
      - And when they who dwelt in the tower of Sichem, had heard this, they went
        into the temple of their god Berith, where they had made a covenant with him,
        and from thence the place had taken its name, and it was exceeding strong.
      - Abimelech also hearing that the men of the tower of Sichem were gathered together,
      - 'Went up into mount Selmon, he and all his people with him: and taking an
        axe, he cut down the bough of a tree, and laying it on his shoulder, and carrying
        it, he said to his companions: What you see me do, do ye out of hand.'
      - 'So they cut down boughs from the trees, every man as fast as he could, and
        followed their leader. And surrounding the fort, they set it on fire: and
        so it came to pass, that with the smoke and with the fire a thousand persons
        were killed, men and women together, of the inhabitants of the town of Sichem.'
      - Then Abimelech, departing from thence, came to the town of Thebes, which he
        surrounded and besieged with his army.
      - And there was in the midst of the city a high tower, to which both the men
        and the women were fled together, and all the princes of the city, and having
        shut and strongly barred the gate, they stood upon the battlements of the
        tower to defend themselves.
      - 'And Abimelech, coming near the tower, fought stoutly: and, approaching to
        the gate, endeavoured to set fire to it:'
      - And behold, a certain woman casting a piece of a millstone from above, dashed
        it against the head of Abimelech, and broke his skull.
      - 'And he called hastily to his armourbearer, and said to him: Draw thy sword,
        and kill me: lest it should be said that I was slain by a woman. He did as
        he was commanded, and slew him.'
      - And when he was dead all the men of Israel that were with him, returned to
        their homes.
      - And God repaid the evil that Abimelech had done against his father, killing
        his seventy brethren.
      - The Sichemites also were rewarded for what they had done, and the curse of
        Joatham, the son of Jerobaal, came upon them.

      - There was at that time Jephte, the Galaadite, a most valiant man, and a warrior,
        the son of a woman that was a harlot, and his father was Galaad.
      - 'Now Galaad had a wife of whom he had sons: who, after they were grown up,
        thrust out Jephte, saying: Thou canst not inherit in the house of our father,
        because thou art born of another mother.'
      - 'Then he fled and avoided them, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were
        gathered to him needy men and robbers, and they followed him as their prince.'
      - In those days the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
      - 'And as they pressed hard upon them, the ancients of Galaad went to fetch
        Jephte out of the land of Tob to help them:'
      - 'And they said to him: Come thou, and be our prince, and fight against the
        children of Ammon.'
      - 'And he answered them: Are not you the men that hated me, and cast me out
        of my father’s house, and now you are come to me, constrained by necessity?'
      - 'And the princes of Galaad said to Jephte: For this cause we are now come
        to thee, that thou mayst go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon,
        and be head over all the inhabitants of Galaad.'
      - 'Jephte also said to them: If you be come to me sincerely, that I should fight
        for you against the children of Ammon, and the Lord shall deliver them into
        my hand, shall I be your prince?'
      - 'They answered him: The Lord, who heareth these things, he himself is mediator
        and witness that we will do as we have promised.'
      - Jephte therefore went with the princes of Galaad, and all the people made
        him their prince. And Jephte spoke all his words before the Lord in Maspha.
      - 'And he sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, to say in his
        name: What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me, to waste
        my land?'
      - 'And he answered them: Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out
        of Egypt, from the confines of the Arnon unto the Jaboc and the Jordan: now,
        therefore, restore the same peaceably to me.'
      - 'And Jephte again sent word by them, and commanded them to say to the king
        of Ammon:'
      - 'Thus saith Jephte: Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land
        of the children of Ammon:'
      - But when they came up out of Egypt, he walked through the desert to the Red
        Sea, and came into Cades.
      - 'And he sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying: Suffer me to pass through
        thy land. But he would not condescend to his request. He sent also to the
        king of Moab, who, likewise, refused to give him passage. He abode, therefore,
        in Cades,'
      - 'And went round the land of Edom at the side, and the land of Moab: and came
        over against the east coast of the land of Moab, and camped on the other side
        of the Arnon: and he would not enter the bounds of Moab.'
      - 'So Israel sent messengers to Sehon, king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in
        Hesebon, and they said to him: Suffer me to pass through thy land to the river.'
      - 'But he, also despising the words of Israel, suffered him not to pass through
        his borders: but gathering an infinite multitude, went out against him to
        Jasa, and made strong opposition.'
      - And the Lord delivered him, with all his army, into the hands of Israel, and
        he slew him, and possessed all the land of the Amorrhite, the inhabitant of
        that country,
      - And all the coasts thereof from the Arnon to the Jaboc, and from the wilderness
        to the Jordan.
      - So the Lord, the God of Israel, destroyed the Amorrhite, his people of Israel
        fighting against him, and wilt thou now possess his land?
      - 'Are not those things which thy god Chamos possesseth, due to thee by right?

      - Whereas he hath dwelt in Hesebon, and the villages thereof, and in Aroer,
        and its villages, and in all the cities near the Jordan, for three hundred
        years. Why have you for so long a time attempted nothing about this claim?
      - Therefore I do not trespass against thee, but thou wrongest me by declaring
        an unjust war against me. The Lord be judge, and decide this day, between
        Israel and the children of Ammon.
      - And the king of the children of Ammon would not hearken to the words of Jephte,
        which he sent him by the messengers.
      - Therefore the spirit of the Lord came upon Jephte, and going round Galaad,
        and Manasses, and Maspha of Galaad, and passing over from thence to the children
        of Ammon,
      - 'He made a vow to the Lord, saying: If thou wilt deliver the children of Ammon
        into my hands,'

        me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, the same will I offer
        a holocaust to the Lord.
      - 'And Jephte passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them: and
        the Lord delivered them into his hands.'
      - 'And he smote them from Aroer till you come to Mennith, twenty cities, and
        as far as Abel, which is set with vineyards, with a very great slaughter:
        and the children of Ammon were humbled by the children of Israel.'
      - 'And when Jephte returned into Maspha, to his house, his only daughter met
        him with timbrels and with dances: for he had no other children.'
      - 'And when he saw her, he rent his garments, and said: Alas! my daughter, thou
        hast deceived me, and thou thyself art deceived: for I have opened my mouth
        to the Lord, and I can do no other thing.'
      - 'And she answered him: My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth to the Lord,
        do unto me whatsoever thou hast promised, since the victory hath been granted
        to thee, and revenge of thy enemies.'
      - 'And she said to her father: Grant me only this, which I desire: Let me go,
        that I may go about the mountains for two months, and may bewail my virginity
        with my companions.'
      - 'And he answered her: Go. And he sent her away for two months. And when she
        was gone with her comrades and companions, she mourned her virginity in the
        mountains.'
      - 'And the two months being expired, she returned to her father, and he did
        to her as he had vowed, and she knew no man. From thence came a fashion in
        Israel, and a custom has been kept:'

      - 'And he answered them: I and my people were at great strife with the children
        of Ammon: and I called you to assist me, and you would not do it.'
      - And when I saw this, I put my life in my own hands, and passed over against
        the children of Ammon and the Lord delivered them into my hands. What have
        I deserved, that you should rise up to fight against me?

        the men of Galaad defeated Ephraim, because he had said: Galaad is a fugitive
        of Ephraim, and dwelleth in the midst of Ephraim and Manasses.'

      - 'And when she was come to her husband, she said to him: A man of God came
        to me, having the countenance of an angel, very awful. And when I asked him
        who he was, and whence he came, and by what name he was called, he would not
        tell me:'
      - 'But he answered thus: Behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son: beware thou
        drink no wine, nor strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: for the child
        shall be a Nazarite of God from his infancy, from his mother’s womb until
        the day of his death.'
      - 'Then Manue prayed to the Lord, and said: I beseech thee, O Lord, that the
        man of God, whom thou didst send, may come again, and teach us what we ought
        to do concerning the child, that shall be born.'
      - And the Lord heard the prayer of Manue, and the angel of the Lord appeared
        again to his wife, as she was sitting in the field. But Manue her husband
        was not with her. And when she saw the angel,
      - 'She made haste, and ran to her husband: and told him, saying: Behold the
        man hath appeared to me, whom I saw before.'
      - 'He rose up, and followed his wife: and coming to the man, said to him: Art
        thou he that spoke to the woman? And he answered: I am.'
      - 'And Manue said to him: When thy word shall come to pass, what wilt thou that
        the child should do? or from what shall he keep himself?'
      - 'And the angel of the Lord said to Manue: From all the things I have spoken
        of to thy wife, let her refrain herself:'
      - 'And let her eat nothing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine
        or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: and whatsoever I have commanded
        her, let her fulfil and observe.'
      - 'And Manue said to the angel of the Lord: I beseech thee to consent to my
        request, and let us dress a kid for thee.'
      - 'And the angel answered him: If thou press me I will not eat of thy bread:
        but if thou wilt offer a holocaust, offer it to the Lord. And Manue knew not
        it was the angel of the Lord.'
      - 'And he said to him: What is thy name, that, if thy word shall come to pass,
        we may honour thee?'
      - 'And he answered him: Why askest thou my name, which is wonderful?'
      - 'Then Manue took a kid of the flocks, and the libations, and put them upon
        a rock, offering to the Lord, who doth wonderful things: and he and his wife
        looked on.'
      - And when the flame from the altar went up towards heaven, the angel of the
        Lord ascended also in the flame. And when Manue and his wife saw this, they
        fell flat on the ground;
      - And the angel of the Lord appeared to them no more. And forthwith Manue understood
        that it was an angel of the Lord,
      - 'And he said to his wife: We shall certainly die, because we have seen God.'
      - 'And his wife answered him: If the Lord had a mind to kill us, he would not
        have received a holocaust and libations at our hands; neither would he have
        shewed us all these things, nor have told us the things that are to come.'
      - And she bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and the
        Lord blessed him.
      - And the Spirit of the Lord began to be with him in the camp of Dan, between
        Saraa and Esthaol.

        of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou wilt take a wife of the
        Philistines, who are uncircumcised? And Samson said to his father: Take this
        woman for me; for she hath pleased my eyes.'
      - 'Now his parents knew not that the thing was done by the Lord, and that he
        sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines
        had dominion over Israel.'
      - Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Thamnatha. And when they
        were come to the vineyards of the town, behold a young lion met him, raging
        and roaring.
      - 'And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, and he tore the lion as he would
        have torn a kid in pieces, having nothing at all in his hand: and he would
        not tell this to his father and mother.'
      - And he went down, and spoke to the woman that had pleased his eyes.
      - And after some days, returning to take her, he went aside to see the carcass
        of the lion, and behold there was a swarm of bees in the mouth of the lion,
        and a honey-comb.
      - 'And when he had taken it in his hands, he went on eating: and coming to his
        father and mother, he gave them of it, and they ate: but he would not tell
        them that he had taken the honey from the body of the lion.'
      - 'So his father went down to the woman, and made a feast for his son Samson:
        for so the young men used to do.'
      - And when the citizens of that place saw him, they brought him thirty companions
        to be with him.
      - 'And Samson said to them: I will propose to you a riddle, which if you declare
        unto me within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty shirts,
        and as many coats:'
      - 'But if you shall not be able to declare it, you shall give me thirty shirts
        and the same number of coats. They answered him: Put forth the riddle, that
        we may hear it.'

        came forth sweetness. And they could not for three days expound the riddle.'

        husband, and persuade him to tell thee what the riddle meaneth. But if thou
        wilt not do it, we will burn thee, and thy father’s house. Have you called
        us to the wedding on purpose to strip us?'
      - 'So she wept before Samson and complained, saying: Thou hatest me, and dost
        not love me: therefore thou wilt not expound to me the riddle, which thou
        hast proposed to the sons of my people. But he answered: I would not tell
        it to my father and mother: and how can I tell it to thee?'
      - 'So she wept before him the seven days of the feast: and, at length, on the
        seventh day, as she was troublesome to him, he expounded it. And she immediately
        told her countrymen.'
      - 'And they, on the seventh day before the sun went down, said to him: What

      - 'And a while after, when the days of the wheat harvest were at hand, Samson
        came, meaning to visit his wife, and he brought her a kid of the flock. And
        when he would have gone into her chamber, as usual, her father would not suffer
        him, saying:'
      - 'I thought thou hadst hated her, and therefore I gave her to thy friend: but

        of her.'
      - 'And Samson answered him: From this day I shall be blameless in what I do
        against the Philistines: for I will do you evils.'
      - 'And he went and caught three hundred foxes, and coupled them tail to tail,
        and fastened torches between the tails:'
      - And setting them on fire he let the foxes go, that they might run about hither
        and thither. And they presently went into the standing corn of the Philistines.
        Which being set on fire, both the corn that was already carried together,
        and that which was yet standing, was all burnt, insomuch that the flame consumed
        also the vineyards and the oliveyards.
      - 'Then the Philistines said: Who hath done this thing? And it was answered:
        Samson, the son in law of the Thamnathite, because he took away his wife,
        and gave her to another, hath done these things. And the Philistines went
        up and burnt both the woman and her father.'
      - 'But Samson said to them: Although you have done this, yet will I be revenged
        of you, and then I will be quiet.'
      - And he made a great slaughter of them, so that in astonishment they laid the
        calf of the leg upon the thigh. And going down he dwelt in a cavern of the
        rock Etam.
      - Then the Philistines going up into the land of Juda, camped in the place which
        afterwards was called Lechi, that is, the Jawbone, where their army was spread
        abroad.
      - 'And the men of the tribe of Juda said to them: Why are you come up against
        us? They answered: We are come to bind Samson, and to pay him for what he
        hath done against us.'
      - 'Wherefore three thousand men of Juda went down to the cave of the rock Etam,
        and said to Samson: Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us? Why
        wouldst thou do thus? And he said to them: As they did to me, so have I done
        to them.'
      - 'And they said to him: We are come to bind thee, and to deliver thee into
        the hands of the Philistines. And Samson said to them: Swear to me, and promise
        me that you will not kill me.'
      - 'They said: We will not kill thee: but we will deliver thee up bound. And
        they bound him with two new cords, and brought him from the rock Etam.'
      - 'Now when he was come to the place of the Jawbone, and the Philistines shouting
        went to meet him, the Spirit of the Lord came strongly upon him: and as flax
        is wont to be consumed at the approach of fire, so the bands with which he
        was bound were broken and loosed.'
      - And finding a jawbone, even the jawbone of an ass, which lay there, catching
        it up, he slew therewith a thousand men.
      - 'And he said: With the jawbone of an ass, with the jaw of the colt of asses,
        I have destroyed them, and have slain a thousand men.'
      - And when he had ended these words, singing, he threw the jawbone out of his
        hand, and called the name of that place Ramathlechi, which is interpreted
        the lifting up of the jawbone.
      - 'And being very thirsty, he cried to the Lord, and said: Thou hast given this
        very great deliverance and victory into the hand of thy servant: and behold
        I die for thirst, and shall fall into the hands of the uncircumcised.'
      - Then the Lord opened a great tooth in the jaw of the ass and waters issued
        out of it. And when he had drunk them, he refreshed his spirit, and recovered
        his strength. Therefore the name of that place was called The Spring of him
        that invoked from the jawbone, until this present day.
      - And he judged Israel, in the days of the Philistines, twenty years.

        that Samson was come into the city, they surrounded him, setting guards at
        the gate of the city, and watching there all the night in silence, that in
        the morning they might kill him as he went out.
      - But Samson slept till midnight, and then rising, he took both the doors of
        the gate, with the posts thereof and the bolt, and laying them on his shoulders,
        carried them up to the top of the hill, which looketh towards Hebron.
      - After this he loved a woman, who dwelt in the valley of Sorec, and she was

        not yet dry, but still moist, I shall be weak like other men.'

        of the Philistines, saying: Come up this once more, for now he hath opened
        his heart to me. And they went up, taking with them the money which they had
        promised.'
      - 'But she made him sleep upon her knees, and lay his head in her bosom. And
        she called a barber and shaved his seven locks, and began to drive him away,
        and thrust him from her: for immediately his strength departed from him.'
      - 'And she said: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And awaking from sleep,
        he said in his mind: I will go out as I did before, and shake myself, not
        knowing that the Lord was departed from him.'
      - Then the Philistines seized upon him, and forthwith pulled out his eyes, and
        led him bound in chains to Gaza, and shutting him up in prison made him grind.
      - And now his hair began to grow again,
      - 'And the princes of the Philistines assembled together, to offer great sacrifices
        to Dagon their god, and to make merry, saying: Our god hath delivered our
        enemy Samson into our hands.'
      - 'And the people also seeing this, praised their god, and said the same: Our
        god hath delivered our adversary into our hands, him that destroyed our country,
        and killed very many.'
      - And rejoicing in their feasts, when they had now taken their good cheer, they
        commanded that Samson should be called, and should play before them. And being
        brought out of prison, he played before them; and they made him stand between
        two pillars.
      - 'And he said to the lad that guided his steps: Suffer me to touch the pillars
        which support the whole house, and let me lean upon them, and rest a little.'
      - Now the house was full of men and women, and all the princes of the Philistines
        were there. Moreover about three thousand persons of both sexes, from the
        roof and the higher part of the house, were beholding Samson’s play.
      - 'But he called upon the Lord, saying: O Lord God remember me, and restore
        to me now my former strength, O my God, that I may revenge myself on my enemies,
        and for the loss of my two eyes I may take one revenge.'
      - And laying hold on both the pillars on which the house rested, and holding
        the one with his right hand, and the other with his left,
      - 'He said: Let me die with the Philistines. And when he had strongly shook
        the pillars, the house fell upon all the princes, and the rest of the multitude,
        that was there: and he killed many more at his death, than he had killed before
        in his life.'
      - 'And his brethren and all his kindred, going down took his body, and buried
        it between Saraa and Esthaol, in the buryingplace of his father Manue: and
        he judged Israel twenty years.'

      - There was at that time a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Michas.
      - 'Who said to his mother: The eleven hundred pieces of silver, which thou hadst
        put aside for thyself, and concerning which thou didst swear in my hearing,
        behold I have, and they are with me. And she said to him. Blessed be my son
        by the Lord.'
      - 'So he restored them to his mother, who said to him: I have consecrated and
        vowed this silver to the Lord, that my son may receive it at my hand, and
        make a graven and a molten god; so now I deliver it to thee.'
      - 'And he restored them to his mother: and she took two hundred pieces of silver
        and gave them to the silversmith, to make of them a graven and a molten god,
        which was in the house of Michas.'
      - 'And he separated also therein a little temple for the god, and made an ephod,
        and theraphim, that is to say, a priestly garment, and idols: and he filled
        the hand of one of his sons, and he became his priest.'
      - In those days there was no king in Israel, but every one did that which seemed
        right to himself.
      - 'There was also another young man of Bethlehem Juda, of the kindred thereof:
        and he was a Levite, and dwelt there.'
      - Now he went out from the city of Bethlehem, and desired to sojourn wheresoever
        he should find it convenient for him. And when he was come to mount Ephraim,
        as he was on his journey, and had turned aside a little into the house of
        Michas,
      - 'He was asked by him whence he came. And he answered: I am a Levite of Bethlehem
        Juda, and I am going to dwell where I can, and where I shall find a place
        to my advantage.'
      - 'And Michas said: Stay with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and
        I will give thee every year ten pieces of silver, and a double suit of apparel,
        and thy victuals.'
      - He was content, and abode with the man, and was unto him as one of his sons.
      - 'And Michas filled his hand, and had the young man with him for his priest,
        saying:'
      - Now I know God will do me good, since I have a priest of the race of the Levites.

      - 'In those days there was no king in Israel, and the tribe of Dan sought them
        an inheritance to dwell in: for unto that day they had not received their
        lot among the other tribes.'
      - 'So the children of Dan sent five most valiant men, of their stock and family,
        from Saraa and Esthaol, to spy out the land, and to view it diligently: and
        they said to them: Go, and view the land. They went on their way, and when
        they came to mount Ephraim, they went into the house of Michas, and rested
        there:'
      - 'And knowing the voice of the young man the Levite, and lodging with him,
        they said to him: Who brought thee hither? what dost thou here? why wouldst
        thou come hither?'
      - 'He answered them: Michas hath done such and such things for me, and hath
        hired me to be his priest.'
      - Then they desired him to consult the Lord, that they might know whether their
        journey should be prosperous, and the thing should have effect.
      - 'He answered them: Go in peace: the Lord looketh on your way, and the journey
        that you go.'
      - 'So the five men going on came to Lais: and they saw how the people dwelt
        therein without any fear, according to the custom of the Sidonians, secure
        and easy, having no man at all to oppose them, being very rich, and living
        separated, at a distance from Sidon and from all men.'
      - 'And they returned to their brethren in Saraa and Esthaol, who asked them
        what they had done: to whom they answered:'
      - 'Arise, and let us go up to them: for we have seen the land which is exceeding
        rich and fruitful: neglect not, lose no time: let us go and possess it, there
        will be no difficulty.'
      - We shall come to a people that is secure, into a spacious country, and the
        Lord will deliver the place to us, in which there is no want of any thing
        that groweth on the earth.
      - There went therefore of the kindred of Dan, to wit, from Saraa and Esthaol,
        six hundred men, furnished with arms for war.
      - 'And going up they lodged in Cariathiarim of Juda: which place from that time
        is called the camp of Dan, and is behind Cariathiarim.'
      - From thence they passed into mount Ephraim. And when they were come to the
        house of Michas,
      - 'The five men, that before had been sent to view the land of Lais, said to
        the rest of their brethren: You know that in these houses there is an ephod
        and theraphim, and a graven and a molten god: see what you are pleased to
        do.'
      - 'And when they had turned a little aside, they went into the house of the
        young man the Levite, who was in the house of Michas: and they saluted him
        with words of peace.'
      - And the six hundred men stood before the door, appointed with their arms.
      - But they that were gone into the house of the young man, went about to take
        away the graven god, and the ephod, and the theraphim, and the molten god,
        and the priest stood before the door, the six hundred valiant men waiting
        not far off.
      - 'So they that were gone in took away the graven thing, the ephod, and the
        idols, and the molten god, And the priest said to them: What are you doing?'
      - 'And they said to him: Hold thy peace, and put thy finger on thy mouth, and
        come with us, that we may have thee for a father, and a priest. Whether is
        better for thee, to be a priest in the house of one man, or in a tribe and
        family in Israel?'
      - When he heard this, he agreed to their words, and took the ephod, and the
        idols, and the graven god, and departed with them.
      - And when they were going forward, and had put before them the children and
        the cattle, and all that was valuable,
      - And were now at a distance from the house of Michas, the men that dwelt in
        the houses of Michas gathering together followed them,
      - 'And began to shout out after them. They looked back, and said to Michas:
        What aileth thee? Why dost thou cry?'
      - 'And he answered: You have taken away my gods which I have made me, and the
        priest, and all that I have, and do you say: What aileth thee?'
      - 'And the children of Dan said to him: See thou say no more to us, lest men
        enraged come upon thee, and thou perish with all thy house.'
      - And so they went on the journey they had begun. But Michas seeing that they
        were stronger than he, returned to his house.
      - 'And the six hundred men took the priest, and the things we spoke of before,
        and came to Lais, to a people that was quiet and secure, and smote them with
        the edge of the sword: and the city they burnt with fire,'
      - 'There being no man at all who brought them any succour, because they dwelt
        far from Sidon, and had no society or business with any man. And the city
        was in the land of Rohob: and they rebuilt it, and dwelt therein,'
      - Calling the name of the city Dan, after the name of their father, who was
        the son of Israel, which before was called Lais.
      - And they set up to themselves the graven idol, and Jonathan the son of Gersam,
        the son of Moses, he and his sons were priests in the tribe of Dan, until
        the day of their captivity.
      - And the idol of Michas remained with them all the time that the house of God
        was in Silo. In those days there was no king in Israel.

        with him four months.
      - 'And her husband followed her, willing to be reconciled with her, and to speak
        kindly to her, and to bring her back with him, having with him a servant and
        two asses: and she received him, and brought him into her father’s house.
        And when his father in law had heard this, and had seen him, he met him with
        joy,'
      - And embraced the man. And the son in law tarried in the house of his father
        in law three days, eating with him and drinking familiarly.
      - 'But on the fourth day, arising early in the morning, he desired to depart.
        But his father in law kept him, and said to him: Taste first a little bread,
        and strengthen thy stomach, and so thou shalt depart.'
      - 'And they sat down together, and ate and drank. And the father of the young
        woman said to his son in law: I beseech thee to stay here to day, and let
        us make merry together.'
      - But he rising up, began to be for departing. And nevertheless his father in
        law earnestly pressed him, and made him stay with him.
      - 'But when morning was come, the Levite prepared to go on his journey. And
        his father in law said to him again: I beseech thee to take a little meat,
        and strengthening thyself, till the day be farther advanced, afterwards thou
        mayest depart. And they ate together.'
      - 'And the young man arose to set forward with his wife and servant. And his
        father in law spoke to him again: Consider that the day is declining, and
        draweth toward evening: tarry with me to day also, and spend the day in mirth,
        and to morrow thou shalt depart, that thou mayest go into thy house.'
      - 'His son in law would not consent to his words: but forthwith went forward,
        and came over against Jebus, which by another name is called Jerusalem, leading
        with him two asses laden, and his concubine.'
      - 'And now they were come near Jebus, and the day was far spent: and the servant
        said to his master: Come, I beseech thee, let us turn into the city of the
        Jebusites, and lodge there.'
      - 'His master answered him: I will not go into the town of another nation, who

        in the street of the city, for no man would receive them to lodge.

        in the evening, and he also was of mount Ephraim, and dwelt as a stranger
        in Gabaa; but the men of that country were the children of Jemini.
      - 'And the old man lifting up his eyes, saw the man sitting with his bundles
        in the street of the city, and said to him: Whence comest thou? and whither
        goest thou?'
      - 'He answered him: We came out from Bethlehem Juda, and we are going to our
        home, which is on the side of mount Ephraim, from whence we went to Bethlehem:
        and now we go to the house of God, and none will receive us under his roof:'

        the use of myself and of thy handmaid, and of the servant that is with me:
        we want nothing but lodging.'
      - 'And the old man answered him: Peace be with thee: I will furnish all things
        that are necessary: only I beseech thee, stay not in the street.'
      - 'And he brought him into his house, and gave provender to his asses: and after
        they had washed their feet, he entertained them with a feast.'

        at the door, calling to the master of the house, and saying: Bring forth the
        man that came into thy house, that we may abuse him:'
      - 'And the old man went out to them, and said: Do not so, my brethren, do not
        so wickedly: because this man is come into my lodging, and cease I pray you
        from this folly.'
      - 'I have a maiden daughter, and this man hath a concubine, I will bring them
        out to you, and you may humble them, and satisfy your lust: only, I beseech
        you, commit not this crime against nature on the man.'
      - 'They would not be satisfied with his words; which the man seeing, brought
        out his concubine to them, and abandoned her to their wickedness: and when
        they had abused her all the night, they let her go in the morning.'
      - But the woman, at the dawning of the day, came to the door of the house, where
        her lord lodged, and there fell down.
      - 'And in the morning the man arose, and opened the door, that he might end
        the journey he had begun: and behold his concubine lay before the door with
        her hands spread on the threshold.'
      - 'He thinking she was taking her rest, said to her: Arise, and let us be going.
        But as she made no answer, perceiving she was dead, he took her up, and laid
        her upon his ass, and returned to his house.'
      - And when he was come home, he took a sword, and divided the dead body of his
        wife with her bones into twelve parts, and sent the pieces into all the borders
        of Israel.

      - 'And all the people standing, answered as by the voice of one man: We will
        not return to our tents, neither shall any one of us go into his own house:'
      - 'But this we will do in common against Gabaa:'
      - We will take ten men of a hundred out of all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred
        out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to bring victuals for
        the army, that we may fight against Gabaa of Benjamin, and render to it for
        its wickedness, what it deserveth.
      - 'And all Israel were gathered together against the city, as one man, with
        one mind, and one counsel:'
      - 'And they sent messengers to all the tribe of Benjamin, to say to them: Why
        hath so great an abomination been found among you?'
      - 'Deliver up the men of Gabaa, that have committed this heinous crime, that
        they may die, and the evil may be taken away out of Israel. But they would
        not hearken to the proposition of their brethren the children of Israel:'
      - But out of all the cities which were of their lot, they gathered themselves
        together into Gabaa, to aid them, and to fight against the whole people of
        Israel.
      - And there were found of Benjamin five and twenty thousand men that drew the
        sword, besides the inhabitants of Gabaa,
      - 'Who were seven hundred most valiant men, fighting with the left hand as well
        as with the right: and slinging stones so sure that they could hit even a
        hair, and not miss by the stone’s going on either side.'
      - Of the men of Israel also, beside the children of Benjamin, were found four
        hundred thousand that drew swords and were prepared to fight.
      - 'And they arose and came to the house of God, that is, to Silo: and they consulted
        God, and said: Who shall be in our army the first to go to the battle against
        the children of Benjamin? And the Lord answered them: Let Juda be your leader.'
      - 'And forthwith the children of Israel rising in the morning, camped by Gabaa:'
      - And going out from thence to fight against Benjamin, began to assault the
        city.
      - And the children of Benjamin coming out of Gabaa slew of the children of Israel
        that day two and twenty thousand men.
      - 'Again Israel, trusting in their strength and their number, set their army
        in array in the same place, where they had fought before:'
      - 'Yet so that they first went up and wept before the Lord until night: and
        consulted him and said: Shall I go out any more to fight against the children
        of Benjamin my brethren or not? And he answered them: Go up against them,
        and join battle.'
      - And when the children of Israel went out the next day to fight against the
        children of Benjamin,
      - 'The children of Benjamin sallied forth out of the gates of Gabaa: and meeting
        them, made so great a slaughter of them, as to kill eighteen thousand men
        that drew the sword.'
      - 'Wherefore all the children of Israel came to the house of God, and sat and
        wept before the Lord: and they fasted that day till the evening, and offered
        to him holocausts, and victims of peace offerings,'
      - And inquired of him concerning their state. At that time the ark of the covenant
        of the Lord was there,
      - 'And Phinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was over the house. So
        they consulted the Lord, and said: Shall we go out any more to fight against
        the children of Benjamin, our brethren, or shall we cease? And the Lord said
        to them: Go up, for to morrow I will deliver them into your hands.'
      - 'And the children of Israel set ambushes round about the city of Gabaa:'
      - And they drew up their army against Benjamin the third time, as they had done
        the first and second.
      - 'And the children of Benjamin boldly issued out of the city, and seeing their
        enemies flee, pursued them a long way, so as to wound and kill some of them,
        as they had done the first and second day, whilst they fled by two highways,
        whereof one goeth up to Bethel and the other to Gabaa, and they slew about
        thirty men:'
      - For they thought to cut them off as they did before. But they artfully feigning
        a flight, designed to draw them away from the city, and by their seeming to
        flee, to bring them to the highways aforesaid.
      - Then all the children of Israel rising up out of the places where they were,
        set their army in battle array, in the place which is called Baalthamar. The
        ambushes also, which were about the city, began by little and little to come
        forth,
      - 'And to march from the west side of the city. And other ten thousand men chosen
        out of all Israel, attacked the inhabitants of the city. And the battle grew
        hot against the children of Benjamin: and they understood not that present
        death threatened them on every side.'
      - And the Lord defeated them before the children of Israel, and they slew of
        them in that day five and twenty thousand, and one hundred, all fighting men,
        and that drew the sword.
      - But the children of Benjamin, when they saw themselves to be too weak, began
        to flee. Which the children of Israel seeing, gave them place to flee, that
        they might come to the ambushes that were prepared, which they had set near
        the city.
      - And they that were in ambush arose on a sudden out of their coverts, and whilst
        Benjamin turned their backs to the slayers, went into the city, and smote
        it with the edge of the sword.
      - 'Now the children of Israel had given a sign to them, whom they had laid in
        ambushes, that after they had taken the city, they should make a fire: that
        by the smoke rising on high, they might shew that the city was taken.'
      - And when the children of Israel saw this in the battle, (for the children
        of Benjamin thought they fled, and pursued them vigorously, killing thirty
        men of their army)
      - 'And perceived, as it were, a pillar of smoke rise up from the city; and Benjamin
        looking back, saw that the city was taken, and that the flames ascended on
        high:'
      - They that before had made as if they fled, turning their faces, stood bravely
        against them. Which the children of Benjamin seeing, turned their backs,
      - And began to go towards the way of the desert, the enemy pursuing them thither
        also. And they that fired the city came also out to meet them.
      - And so it was, that they were slain on both sides by the enemies, and there
        was no rest of their men dying. They fell and were beaten down on the east
        side of the city of Gabaa.
      - And they that were slain in the same place, were eighteen thousand men, all
        most valiant soldiers.
      - And when they that remained of Benjamin saw this, they fled into the wilderness,
        and made towards the rock that is called Remmon. In that flight also, as they
        were straggling, and going different ways; they slew of them five thousand
        men. And as they went farther, they still pursued them, and slew also other
        two thousand.
      - And so it came to pass, that all that were slain of Benjamin, in divers places,
        were five and twenty thousand fighting men, most valiant for war.
      - 'And there remained of all the number of Benjamin only six hundred men that
        were able to escape, and flee to the wilderness: and they abode in the rock
        Remmon four months.'
      - But the children of Israel returning, put all the remains of the city to the
        sword, both men and beasts, and all the cities and villages of Benjamin were
        consumed with devouring flames.
