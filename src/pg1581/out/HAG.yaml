book_intro: 'AGGEUS was one of those that returned from the captivity of Babylon,
  in the first year of the reign of king Cyrus. He was sent by the Lord, in the second
  year of the reign of king Darius, the son of Hystaspes, to exhort Zorobabel the
  prince of Juda, and Jesus the high priest, to the building of the temple; which
  they had begun, but left off again through the opposition of the Samaritans. In
  consequence of this exhortation they proceeded in the building and finished the
  temple. And the prophet was commissioned by the Lord to assure them that this second
  temple should be more glorious than the former, because the Messiah should honour
  it with his presence: signifying withal how much the church of the New Testament
  should excel that of the Old Testament.'

      - 'In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day
        of the month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus the prophet,
        to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, governor of Juda, and to Jesus the son
        of Josedec the high priest, saying:'
      - 'Thus saith the Lord of hosts, saying: This people saith: The time is not
        yet come for building the house of the Lord.'
      - 'And the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus the prophet, saying:'
      - Is it time for you to dwell in ceiled houses, and this house lie desolate?
      - 'And now thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts to consider your ways.'
      - 'You have sowed much, and brought in little: you have eaten, but have not
        had enough: you have drunk, but have not been filled with drink: you have
        clothed yourselves, but have not been warmed: and he that hath earned wages,
        put them into a bag with holes.'
      - 'Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts upon your ways:'
      - 'Go up to the mountain, bring timber, and build the house: and it shall be
        acceptable to me, and I shall be glorified, saith the Lord.'
      - 'You have looked for more, and behold it became less, and you brought it home,
        and I blowed it away: why, saith the Lord of hosts? because my house is desolate,
        and you make haste every man to his own house.'
      - 'Therefore the heavens over you were stayed from giving dew, and the earth
        was hindered from yielding her fruits:'
      - And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon
        the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon all that the ground
        bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon beasts, and upon all the labour of
        the hands.
      - 'Then Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec the high
        priest, and all the remnant of the people hearkened to the voice of the Lord
        their God, and to the words of Aggeus the prophet, as the Lord their God sent
        him to them: and the people feared before the Lord.'
      - 'And Aggeus the messenger of the Lord, as one of the messengers of the Lord,
        spoke, saying to the people: I am with you, saith the Lord.'
      - 'And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zorobabel the son of Salathiel governor
        of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and the
        spirit of all the rest of the people: and they went in, and did the work in
        the house of the Lord of Hosts their God.'
  - chapter_intro: Christ by his coming shall make the latter temple more glorious

          - note: 'That is, by having touched the dead; in which case, according to
              the prescription of the law, Num. 19.13, 22, a person not only became
              unclean himself, but made every thing that he touched unclean. The prophet
              applies all this to the people, whose souls remained unclean by neglecting
              the temple of God; and therefore were not sanctified by the flesh they
              offered in sacrifice: but rather defiled their sacrifices by approaching
              to them in the state of uncleanness.'

      - 'Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel the governor of Juda, and to Jesus
        the son of Josedec the high priest, and to the rest of the people, saying:'
      - Who is left among you, that saw this house in its first glory? and how do
        you see it now? is it not in comparison to that as nothing in your eyes?
      - 'Yet now take courage, O Zorobabel, saith the Lord, and take courage, Jesus
        the son of Josedec the high priest, and take courage, all ye people of the
        land, saith the Lord of hosts: and perform (for I am with you, saith the Lord

        I will fill this house with glory: saith the Lord of hosts.'

        the Lord of hosts: and in this place I will give peace, saith the Lord of
        hosts.'

      - 'If a man carry sanctified flesh in the skirt of his garment, and touch with
        his skirt, bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat: shall it be sanctified?
        And the priests answered, and said: No.'
      - 'And Aggeus said: If one that is unclean by occasion of a soul touch any of
        all these things, shall it be defiled? And the priests answered, and said:
        It shall be defiled.'
      - 'And Aggeus answered, and said: So is this people, and so is this nation before
        my face, saith the Lord, and so is all the work of their hands: and all that

        into the press, to press out fifty vessels, and they became twenty.'

        mildew and with hail, yet there was none among you that returned to me, saith
        the Lord.

        day of the ninth month: from the day that the foundations of the temple of
        the Lord were laid, and lay it up in your hearts.'
      - Is the seed as yet sprung up? or hath the vine, and the fig tree, and the
        pomegranate, and the olive tree as yet flourished? from this day I will bless
        you.
      - 'And the word of the Lord came a second time to Aggeus in the four and twentieth
        day of the month, saying:'
      - 'Speak to Zorobabel the governor of Juda, saying: I will move both heaven
        and earth.'
      - 'And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and will destroy the strength
        of the kingdom of the Gentiles: and I will overthrow the chariot, and him
        that rideth therein: and the horses and their riders shall come down, every
        one by the sword of his brother.'
      - In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, I will take thee, O Zorobabel the son
        of Salathiel, my servant, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a signet,
