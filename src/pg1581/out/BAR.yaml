book_intro: 'BARUCH was a man of noble extraction, and learned in the law, secretary
  and disciple to the prophet JEREMIAS, and a sharer in his labours and persecutions:
  which is the reason why the ancient fathers have considered this book as a part
  of the prophecy of JEREMIAS, and have usually quoted it under his name.'

      - But now, you shall see in Babylon gods of gold, and of silver, and of stone,
        and of wood borne upon shoulders, causing fear to the Gentiles.
      - Beware therefore that you imitate not the doings of others, and be afraid,
        and the fear of them should seize upon you.
      - 'But when you see the multitude behind, and before, adoring them, say you
        in your hearts: Thou oughtest to be adored, O Lord.'
      - 'For my angel is with you: And I myself will demand an account of your souls.'
      - For their tongue that is polished by the craftsman, and themselves laid over
        with gold and silver, are false things, and they cannot speak.
      - 'And as if it were for a maiden that loveth to go gay: so do they take gold
        and make them up.'
      - 'Their gods have golden crowns upon their heads: whereof the priests secretly
        convey away from them gold, and silver, and bestow it on themselves.'
      - 'Yea and they give thereof to prostitutes, and they dress out harlots: and
        again when they receive it of the harlots, they adorn their gods.'
      - And these gods cannot defend themselves from the rust, and the moth.
      - But when they have covered them with a purple garment, they wipe their face
        because of the dust of the house, which is very much among them.
      - This holdeth a sceptre as a man, as a judge of the country, but cannot put
        to death one that offendeth him.
      - And this hath in his hand a sword, or an axe, but cannot save himself from
        war, or from robbers, whereby be it known to you, that they are not gods.
      - 'Therefore fear them not. For as a vessel that a man uses when it is broken
        becometh useless, even so are their gods:'
      - When they are placed in the house, their eyes are full of dust by the feet
        of them that go in.
      - And as the gates are made sure on every side upon one that hath offended the
        king, or like a dead man carried to the grave, so do the priests secure the
        doors with bars and locks, lest they be stripped by thieves.
      - 'They light candles to them, and in great number, of which they cannot see
        one: but they are like beams in the house.'
      - And they say that the creeping things which are of the earth, gnaw their hearts,
        while they eat them and their garments, and they feel it not.
      - Their faces are black with the smoke that is made in the house.
      - Owls, and swallows, and other birds fly upon their bodies, and upon their
        heads, and cats in like manner.
      - Whereby you may know that they are no gods. Therefore fear them not.
      - 'The gold also which they have, is for shew, but except a man wipe off the
        rust, they will not shine: for neither when they were molten, did they feel
        it.'
      - Men buy them at a high price, whereas there is no breath in them.
      - And having not the use of feet they are carried upon shoulders, declaring
        to men how vile they are. Be they confounded also that worship them.
      - Therefore if they fall to the ground, they rise not up again of themselves,
        nor if a man set them upright, will they stand by themselves, but their gifts
        shall be set before them, as to the dead.
      - 'The things that are sacrificed to them, their priests sell and abuse: in
        like manner also their wives take part of them, but give nothing of it either
        to the sick, or to the poor.'
      - 'The childbearing and menstruous women touch their sacrifices: knowing, therefore,
        by these things that they are not gods, fear them not.'
      - 'For how can they be called gods? because women set offerings before the gods
        of silver, and of gold, and of wood:'
      - And priests sit in their temples, having their garments rent, and their heads
        and beards shaven, and nothing upon their heads.
      - And they roar and cry before their gods, as men do at the feast when one is
        dead.
      - The priests take away their garments, and clothe their wives and their children.
      - 'And whether it be evil that one doth unto them, or good, they are not able
        to recompense it: neither can they set up a king, nor put him down:'
      - 'In like manner they can neither give riches, nor requite evil. If a man make
        a vow to them, and perform it not: they cannot require it.'
      - They cannot deliver a man from death, nor save the weak from the mighty.
      - 'They cannot restore the blind man to his sight: nor deliver a man from distress.'
      - They shall not pity the widow, nor do good to the fatherless.
      - 'Their gods, of wood, and of stone, and of gold, and of silver, are like the
        stones that are hewn out of the mountains: and they that worship them shall
        be confounded.'
      - How then is it to be supposed, or to be said, that they are gods?
      - 'Even the Chaldeans themselves dishonor them: who when they hear of one dumb
        that cannot speak, they present him to Bel, entreating him, that he may speak.'
      - 'As though they could be sensible that have no motion themselves: and they,
        when they shall perceive this, will leave them: for their gods themselves
        have no sense.'
      - The women also, with cords about them, sit in the ways, burning olive-stones.
      - And when any one of them, drawn away by some passenger, lieth with him, she
        upbraideth her neighbor, that she was not thought as worthy as herself, nor
        her cord broken.
      - 'But all things that are done about them, are false: how is it then to be
        thought, or to be said, that they are gods?'
      - And they are made by workmen, and by goldsmiths. They shall be nothing else
        but what the priests will have them to be.
      - For the artificers themselves that make them, are of no long continuance.
        Can those things then that are made by them, be gods?
      - But they have left false things and reproach to them that come after.
      - 'For when war cometh upon them, or evils: the priests consult with themselves,
        where they may hide themselves with them.'
      - How then can they be thought to be gods, that can neither deliver themselves
        from war, nor save themselves from evils?
      - 'For seeing they are but of wood, and laid over with gold, and with silver,
        it shall be known hereafter that they are false things, by all nations, and
        kings: and it shall be manifest that they are no gods, but the work of men’s
        hands, and that there is no work of God in them.'
      - Whence, therefore, is it known that they are not gods, but the work of men’s
        hands, and no work of God is in them?
      - They cannot set up a king over the land, nor give rain to men.
      - 'They determine no causes, nor deliver countries from oppression: because
        they can do nothing, and are as daws between heaven and earth.'
      - 'For when fire shall fall upon the house of these gods of wood, and of silver,
        and of gold, their priests indeed will flee away, and be saved: but they themselves
        shall be burnt in the midst like beams.'
      - And they cannot withstand a king and war. How then can it be supposed, or
        admitted, that they are gods?
      - 'Neither are these gods of wood, and of stone, and laid over with gold, and
        with silver, able to deliver themselves from thieves or robbers: they that
        are stronger than them,'
      - Shall take from them the gold, and silver, and the raiment wherewith they
        are clothed, and shall go their way, neither shall they help themselves.
      - 'Therefore it is better to be a king that sheweth his power: or else a profitable
        vessel in the house, with which the owner thereof will be well satisfied:
        or a door in the house, to keep things safe that are therein, than such false
        gods.'
      - The sun, and the moon, and the stars being bright, and sent forth for profitable
        uses, are obedient.
      - 'In like manner the lightning, when it breaketh forth, is easy to be seen:
        and after the same manner the wind bloweth in every country.'
      - And the clouds, when God commandeth them to go over the whole world, do that
        which is commanded them.
      - The fire also being sent from above to consume mountains, and woods, doth
        as it is commanded. But these neither in shew, nor in power, are like to any
        one of them.
      - 'Wherefore it is neither to be thought, nor to be said, that they are gods:
        since they are neither able to judge causes, nor to do any good to men.'
      - Knowing, therefore, that they are not gods, fear them not.
      - For neither can they curse kings, nor bless them.
      - Neither do they shew signs in the heaven to the nations, nor shine as the
        sun, nor give light as the moon.
      - Beasts are better than they, which can fly under a covert, and help themselves.
      - 'Therefore there is no manner of appearance that they are gods: so fear them
        not.'
      - For as a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers keepeth nothing, so are their
        gods of wood, and of silver, and laid over with gold.
      - They are no better than a white thorn in a garden, upon which every bird sitteth.
        In like manner also their gods of wood, and laid over with gold, and with
        silver, are like to a dead body cast forth in the dark.
      - By the purple also and the scarlet which are motheaten upon them, you shall
        know that they are not gods. And they themselves at last are consumed, and
        shall be a reproach in the country.
      - 'Better, therefore, is the just man that hath no idols: for he shall be far
        from reproach.'
