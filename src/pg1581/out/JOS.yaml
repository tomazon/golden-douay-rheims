book_intro: 'This Book is called JOSUE, because it contains the history of what passed
  under him, and according to the common opinion was written by him. The Greeks call
  him Jesus: for Josue and Jesus in the Hebrew, are the same name, and have the same
  signification, viz., A SAVIOUR. And it was not without a mystery that he who was
  to bring the people into the land of promise should have his name changed from OSEE
  (for so he was called before, Num. 13.17,) to JOSUE or JESUS, to give us to understand,
  that Moses by his law could only bring the people within sight of the promised inheritance,
  but that our Saviour JESUS was to bring us into it.'

        him:'
      - 'Moses my servant is dead: arise, and pass over this Jordan, thou and thy
        people with thee, into the land which I will give to the children of Israel.'
      - I will deliver to you every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon,
        as I have said to Moses.
      - From the desert, and from Libanus unto the great river Euphrates, all the
        land of the Hethites, unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun,
        shall be your border.
      - 'No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life: as I have been
        with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee.'
      - 'Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt divide by lot to this people
        the land for which I swore to their fathers, that I would deliver it to them.'
      - 'Take courage therefore, and be very valiant: that thou mayst observe and
        do all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded thee: turn not from
        it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayst understand all things
        which thou dost.'
      - 'Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth: but thou shalt meditate
        on it day and night, that thou mayst observe and do all things that are written
        in it: then shalt thou direct thy way, and understand it.'
      - 'Behold I command thee, take courage, and be strong. Fear not, and be not
        dismayed: because the Lord thy God is with thee in all things whatsoever thou
        shalt go to.'

        of the camp, and command the people, and say:'
      - 'Prepare your victuals: for after the third day you shall pass over the Jordan,
        and shall go in to possess the land, which the Lord your God will give you.'
      - 'And he said to the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses:'
      - 'Remember the word, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying:
        The Lord your God hath given you rest, and all this land.'
      - 'Your wives, and children; and cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses
        gave you on this side of the Jordan: but pass you over armed before your brethren
        all of you that are strong of hand, and fight for them,'
      - 'Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given you, and they
        also possess the land which the Lord your God will give them: and so you shall
        return into the land of your possession, and you shall dwell in it, which
        Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan, toward the rising
        of the sun.'
      - 'And they made answer to Josue, and said: All that thou hast commanded us,
        we will do: and whither soever thou shalt send us, we will go.'
      - 'As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey thee also: only be the
        Lord thy God with thee, as he was with Moses.'
      - 'He that shall gainsay thy mouth, and not obey all thy words, that thou shalt
        command him, let him die: only take thou courage, and do manfully.'

        said to them: Go, and view the land, and the city of Jericho. They went, and
        entered into the house of a woman that was a harlot, named Rahab, and lodged
        with her.'
      - 'And it was told the king of Jericho, and was said: Behold there are men come
        in hither, by night, of the children of Israel, to spy the land.'
      - 'And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying: Bring forth the men that came
        to thee, and are entered into thy house: for they are spies, and are come
        to view all the land.'

        me, but I knew not whence they were:'
      - 'And at the time of shutting the gate in the dark, they also went out together.
        I know not whither they are gone: pursue after them quickly, and you will
        overtake them.'

        the stalks of flax, which was there.
      - 'Now they that were sent, pursued after them, by the way that leadeth to the
        fords of the Jordan: and as soon as they were gone out, the gate was presently
        shut.'
      - 'The men that were hid were not yet asleep, when behold the woman went up
        to them, and said:'
      - 'I know that the Lord hath given this land to you: for the dread of you is
        fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land have lost all strength.'
      - 'We have heard that the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea, at your going
        in, when you came out of Egypt: and what things you did to the two kings of
        the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan, Sehon and Og whom you slew.'
      - 'And at the hearing these things, we were affrighted, and our heart fainted
        away, neither did there remain any spirit in us, at your coming in: for the
        Lord your God he is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath.'
      - 'Now, therefore, swear ye to me by the Lord, that as I have shewed mercy to
        you, so you also will shew mercy to my father’s house: and give me a true
        token.'

        things that are theirs, and deliver our souls from death.
      - 'They answered her: Be our lives for you unto death, only if thou betray us
        not. And when the Lord shall have delivered us the land, we will shew thee
        mercy and truth.'

        close to the wall.'
      - 'And she said to them: Get ye up to the mountains, lest perhaps they meet
        you as they return: and there lie ye hid three days, till they come back,
        and so you shall go on your way.'
      - 'And they said to her: We shall be blameless of this oath, which thou hast
        made us swear,'
      - 'If, when we come into the land, this scarlet cord be a sign, and thou tie
        it in the window, by which thou hast let us down: and gather together thy
        father and mother, and brethren, and all thy kindred into thy house.'
      - Whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house, his blood shall be upon his
        own head, and we shall be quit. But the blood of all that shall be with thee
        in the house, shall light upon our head, if any man touch them.
      - But if thou wilt betray us, and utter this word abroad, we shall be quit of
        this oath, which thou hast made us swear.
      - 'And she answered: As you have spoken, so be it done: and sending them on
        their way, she hung the scarlet cord in the window.'
      - But they went and came to the mountains, and stayed there three days, till
        they that pursued them were returned. For having sought them through all the
        way, they found them not.
      - 'And when they were gone back into the city, the spies returned, and came

        son of Nun, and told him all that befel them,'
      - 'And said: the Lord hath delivered all this land into our hands, and all the
        inhabitants thereof are overthrown with fear.'

        Setim, and came to the Jordan: he, and all the children of Israel, and they
        abode there for three days.'
      - After which, the heralds went through the midst of the camp,
      - 'And began to proclaim: When you shall see the ark of the covenant of the
        Lord your God, and the priests of the race of Levi carrying it, rise you up
        also, and follow them as they go before:'
      - 'And let there be between you and the ark the space of two thousand cubits:
        that you may see it afar off, and know which way you must go: for you have
        not gone this way before: and take care you come not near the ark.'
      - 'And Josue said to the people: Be ye sanctified: for tomorrow the Lord will
        do wonders among you.'
      - 'And he said to the priests: Take up the ark of the covenant, and go before
        the people. And they obeyed his commands, and took it up, and walked before
        them.'

        that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I am with thee also.'
      - 'And do thou command the priests, that carry the ark of the covenant, and
        say to them: When you shall have entered into part of the water of the Jordan,
        stand in it.'
      - 'And Josue said to the children of Israel: Come hither, and hear the word
        of the Lord your God.'
      - 'And again he said: By this you shall know, that the Lord, the living God,
        is in the midst of you, and that he shall destroy, before your sight, the
        Chanaanite and the Hethite, the Hevite and the Pherezite, the Gergesite also,
        and the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite.'
      - Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth shall go before
        you into the Jordan.
      - Prepare ye twelve men of the tribes of Israel, one of every tribe.
      - 'And when the priests, that carry the ark of the Lord the God of the whole
        earth, shall set the soles of their feet in the waters of the Jordan, the
        waters that are beneath shall run down and go off: and those that come from
        above, shall stand together upon a heap.'
      - 'So the people went out of their tents, to pass over the Jordan: and the priests
        that carried the ark of the covenant, went on before them.'
      - And as soon as they came into the Jordan, and their feet were dipped in part
        of the water, (now the Jordan, it being harvest time, had filled the banks
        of its channel,)
      - 'The waters that came down from above stood in one place, and swelling up
        like a mountain, were seen afar off, from the city that is called Adom, to
        the place of Sarthan: but those that were beneath, ran down into the sea of
        the wilderness, (which now is called the Dead Sea) until they wholly failed.'
      - 'And the people marched over against Jericho: and the priests that carried
        the ark of the covenant of the Lord, stood girded upon the dry ground in the
        midst of the Jordan, and all the people passed over, through the channel that
        was dried up.'

    verses:
      - ~
      - 'And when they were passed over, the Lord said to Josue:'
      - 'Choose twelve men, one of every tribe:'
      - And command them to take out of the midst of the Jordan, where the feet of
        the priests stood, twelve very hard stones, which you shall set in the place
        of the camp, where you shall pitch your tents this night.
      - And Josue called twelve men, whom he had chosen out of the children of Israel,
        one out of every tribe,
      - 'And he said to them: Go before the ark of the Lord your God to the midst
        of the Jordan, and carry from thence every man a stone on your shoulders,
        according to the number of the children of Israel,'
      - 'That it may be a sign among you: and when your children shall ask you tomorrow,
        saying: What means these stones?'
      - 'You shall answer them: The waters of the Jordan ran off before the ark of
        the covenant of the Lord when it passed over the same: therefore were these
        stones set for a monument of the children of Israel forever.'
      - The children of Israel therefore did as Josue commanded them, carrying out
        of the channel of the Jordan twelve stones, as the Lord had commanded him
        according to the number of the children of Israel unto the place wherein they
        camped, and there they set them.
      - 'And Josue put other twelve stones in the midst of the channel of the Jordan,
        where the priests stood that carried the ark of the covenant: and they are
        there until this present day.'
      - Now the priests that carried the ark, stood in the midst of the Jordan, till
        all things were accomplished, which the Lord had commanded Josue to speak
        to the people, and Moses had said to him. And the people made haste, and passed
        over.
      - And when they had all passed over, the ark also of the Lord passed over, and
        the priests went before the people.
      - The children of Ruben also, and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasses, went
        armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had commanded them.
      - And forty thousand fighting men by their troops and bands, marched through
        the plains and fields of the city of Jericho.
      - In that day the Lord magnified Josue in the sight of all Israel, that they
        should fear him, as they had feared Moses, while he lived.
      - 'And he said to him:'
      - Command the priests, that carry the ark of the covenant, to come up out of
        the Jordan.
      - 'And he commanded them, saying: Come ye up out of the Jordan.'
      - And when they that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, were come
        up, and began to tread on the dry ground, the waters returned into their channel,
        and ran as they were wont before.
      - And the people came up out of the Jordan, the tenth day of the first month,
        and camped in Galgal, over against the east side of the city of Jericho.
      - And the twelve stones, which they had taken out of the channel of the Jordan,
        Josue pitched in Galgal,
      - 'And said to the children of Israel: When your children shall ask their fathers
        tomorrow, and shall say to them: What mean these stones?'
      - 'You shall teach them, and say: Israel passed over this Jordan through the
        dry channel,'
      - 'The Lord your God drying up the waters thereof in your sight, until you passed
        over:'
      - 'As he had done before in the Red Sea, which he dried up till we passed through:'
      - That all the people of the earth may learn the most mighty hand of the Lord,
        that you also may fear the Lord your God for ever.

              of circumcision; which had been omitted during their forty years’ sojourning
              in the wilderness; by reason of their being always uncertain when they
              should be obliged to march.
            quote: The second time
    verses:
      - ~
      - Now when all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwelt beyond the Jordan, westward,
        and all the kings of Chanaan, who possessed the places near the great sea,
        had heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the children
        of Israel, till they passed over, their heart failed them, and there remained
        no spirit in them, fearing the coming in of the children of Israel.
      - 'At that time the Lord said to Josue: Make thee knives of stone, and circumcise
        the second time the children of Israel.'
      - He did what the Lord had commanded, and he circumcised the children of Israel
        in the hill of the foreskins.
      - 'Now this is the cause of the second circumcision: All the people that came
        out of Egypt that were males, all the men fit for war, died in the desert,
        during the time of the long going about in the way:'
      - Now these were all circumcised. But the people that were born in the desert,
      - 'During the forty years of the journey in the wide wilderness, were uncircumcised:
        till all they were consumed that had not heard the voice of the Lord, and
        to whom he had sworn before, that he would not shew them the land flowing
        with milk and honey.'
      - 'The children of these succeeded in the place of their fathers, and were circumcised
        by Josue: for they were uncircumcised even as they were born, and no one had
        circumcised them in the way.'
      - Now after they were all circumcised, they remained in the same place of the
        camp, until they were healed.
      - 'And the Lord said to Josue: This day have I taken away from you the reproach
        of Egypt. And the name of that place was called Galgal, until this present
        day.'
      - 'And the children of Israel abode in Galgal, and they kept the phase, on the
        fourteenth day of the month at evening, in the plains of Jericho:'
      - And they ate on the next day unleavened bread of the corn of the land, and
        frumenty of the same year.
      - And the manna ceased after they ate of the corn of the land, neither did the
        children of Israel use that food any more, but they ate of the corn of the
        present year of the land of Chanaan.
      - 'And when Josue was in the field of the city of Jericho, he lifted up his
        eyes, and saw a man standing over against him, holding a drawn sword, and
        he went to him, and said: Art thou one of ours, or of our adversaries?'
      - 'And he answered: No: but I am prince of the host of the Lord, and now I am
        come.'
      - 'Josue fell on his face to the ground. And worshipping, said: What saith my
        lord to his servant?'

      - Now Jericho was close shut up and fenced, for fear of the children of Israel,
        and no man durst go out or come in.

        the king thereof, and all the valiant men.'
      - 'Go round about the city all ye fighting men once a day: so shall ye do for
        six days.'
      - 'And on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven trumpets, which are
        used in the jubilee, and shall go before the ark of the covenant: and you
        shall go about the city seven times, and the priests shall sound the trumpets.'
      - And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and broken tune, and
        shall sound in your ears, all the people shall shout together with a very
        great shout, and the walls of the city shall fall to the ground, and they
        shall enter in every one at the place against which they shall stand.
      - 'Then Josue, the son of Nun, called the priests, and said to them: Take the
        ark of the covenant: and let seven other priests take the seven trumpets of
        the jubilee, and march before the ark of the Lord.'
      - 'And he said to the people: Go, and compass the city, armed, marching before
        the ark of the Lord.'
      - And when Josue had ended his words, and the seven priests blew the seven trumpets
        before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
      - And all the armed men went before, the rest of the common people followed
        the ark, and the sound of the trumpets was heard on all sides.
      - 'But Josue had commanded the people, saying: You shall not shout, nor shall
        your voice be heard, nor any word go out of your mouth: until the day come
        wherein I shall say to you: Cry, and shout.'
      - So the ark of the Lord went about the city once a day, and returning into
        the camp, abode there.
      - And Josue rising before day, the priests took the ark of the Lord,
      - 'And seven of them seven trumpets, which are used in the jubilee: and they
        went before the ark of the Lord, walking and sounding the trumpets: and the
        armed men went before them, and the rest of the common people followed the
        ark, and they blew the trumpets.'
      - And they went round about the city the second day once, and returned into
        the camp. So they did six days.
      - But the seventh day, rising up early, they went about the city, as it was
        ordered, seven times.
      - 'And when in the seventh going about the priests sounded with the trumpets,
        Josue said to all Israel: Shout: for the Lord hath delivered the city to you:'
      - 'And let this city be an anathema, and all things that are in it, to the Lord.
        Let only Rahab, the harlot, live, with all that are with her in the house:
        for she hid the messengers whom we sent.'
      - But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that are forbidden, and
        you be guilty of transgression, and all the camp of Israel be under sin, and
        be troubled.
      - But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be, or vessels of brass and iron,
        let it be consecrated to the Lord, laid up in his treasures.
      - 'So all the people making a shout, and the trumpets sounding, when the voice
        and the sound thundered in the ears of the multitude, the walls forthwith
        fell down: and every man went up by the place that was over against him: and
        they took the city,'
      - And killed all that were in it, man and woman, young and old. The oxen also,
        and the sheep, and the asses, they slew with the edge of the sword.
      - 'But Josue said to the two men that had been sent for spies: Go into the harlot’s
        house, and bring her out, and all things that are hers, as you assured her
        by oath.'
      - And the young men went in, and brought out Rahab, and her parents, her brethren
        also, and all her goods, and her kindred, and made them to stay without the
        camp.
      - But they burned the city, and all things that were therein; except the gold
        and silver, and vessels of brass and iron, which they consecrated unto the
        treasury of the Lord.
      - 'But Josue saved Rahab the harlot, and her father’s house, and all she had,
        and they dwelt in the midst of Israel until this present day: because she
        hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy out Jericho. At that time, Josue
        made an imprecation, saying:'
      - Cursed be the man before the Lord, that shall raise up and build the city
        of Jericho. In his firstborn may he lay the foundation thereof, and in the
        last of his children set up its gates.
      - And the Lord was with Josue, and his name was noised throughout all the land.

        and the Lord was angry against the children of Israel.'
      - 'And when Josue sent men from Jericho against Hai, which is beside Bethaven,
        on the east side of the town of Bethel, he said to them: Go up, and view the
        country: and they fulfilled his command, and viewed Hai.'
      - 'And returning, they said to him: Let not all the people go up, but let two
        or three thousand men go, and destroy the city: why should all the people
        be troubled in vain, against enemies that are very few?'

        and thirty men: and the enemies pursued them from the gate as far as Sabarim,

        was struck with fear, and melted like water.'
      - 'But Josue rent his garments, and fell flat on the ground, before the ark
        of the Lord, until the evening, both he and all the ancients of Israel: and
        they put dust upon their heads.'
      - 'And Josue said: Alas, O Lord God, why wouldst thou bring this people over
        the river Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite, and to destroy
        us? would God we had stayed beyond the Jordan, as we began.'
      - My Lord God, what shall I say, seeing Israel turning their backs to their
        enemies?
      - 'The Chanaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land, will hear of it, and
        being gathered together will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth:

      - 'Israel hath sinned, and transgressed my covenant: and they have taken of

        because he is defiled with the anathema. I will be no more with you, till
        you destroy him that is guilty of this wickedness.'
      - 'Arise, sanctify the people, and say to them: Be ye sanctified against tomorrow:
        for thus saith the Lord God of Israel: The curse is in the midst of thee,
        O Israel: thou canst not stand before thy enemies, till he be destroyed out
        of thee, that is defiled with this wickedness.'
      - 'And you shall come in the morning, every one by your tribes: and what tribe
        soever the lot shall find, it shall come by its kindreds, and the kindred
        by its houses and the house by the men.'
      - And whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of this fact, he shall be burnt
        with fire, with all his substance, because he hath transgressed the covenant
        of the Lord, and hath done wickedness in Israel.
      - Josue, therefore, when he rose in the morning, made Israel to come by their
        tribes, and the tribe of Juda was found.
      - 'Which being brought by in families, it was found to be the family of Zare.
        Bringing that also by the houses, he found it to be Zabdi:'
      - And bringing his house man by man, he found Achan, the son of Charmi, the
        son of Zabdi, the son of Zare, of the tribe of Juda.
      - 'And Josue said to Achan: My son, give glory to the Lord God of Israel, and
        confess, and tell me what thou hast done, hide it not.'
      - 'And Achan answered Josue, and said to him: Indeed I have sinned against the

        I took them away, and hid them in the ground in the midst of my tent, and

      - 'Josue therefore sent ministers: who running to his tent, found all hid in
        the same place, together with the silver.'
      - And taking them away out of the tent, they brought them to Josue, and to all
        the children of Israel, and threw them down before the Lord.
      - 'Then Josue, and all Israel with him, took Achan, the son of Zare, and the
        silver, and the garment, and the golden rule, his sons also, and his daughters,

        I have delivered into thy hand the king thereof, and the people, and the city,
        and the land.'
      - 'And thou shalt do to the city of Hai, and to the king thereof, as thou hast
        done to Jericho, and to the king thereof: but the spoils, and all the cattle,
        you shall take for a prey to yourselves: lay an ambush for the city behind
        it.'
      - 'And Josue arose, and all the army of the fighting men with him, to go up
        against Hai: and he sent thirty thousand chosen valiant men in the night,'
      - 'And commanded them, saying: Lay an ambush behind the city: and go not very
        far from it: and be ye all ready.'
      - 'But I, and the rest of the multitude which is with me, will approach on the
        contrary side against the city. And when they shall come out against us, we
        will flee, and turn our backs, as we did before:'
      - 'Till they pursuing us be drawn farther from the city: for they will think
        that we flee as before.'
      - 'And whilst we are fleeing, and they pursuing, you shall rise out of the ambush,
        and shall destroy the city: and the Lord your God will deliver it into your
        hands.'
      - And when you shall have taken it, set it on fire, and you shall do all things
        so as I have commanded.
      - And he sent them away, and they went on to the place of the ambush, and abode
        between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the city of Hai. But Josue staid
        that night in the midst of the people,
      - And rising early in the morning, he mustered his soldiers, and went up with
        the ancients in the front of the army, environed with the aid of the fighting
        men.
      - And when they were come, and were gone up over against the city, they stood
        on the north side of the city, between which and them there was a valley in
        the midst.
      - 'And he had chosen five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between
        Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the same city:'
      - But all the rest of the army went in battle array on the north side, so that
        the last of that multitude reached to the west side of the city. So Josue
        went that night, and stood in the midst of the valley.
      - And when the king of Hai saw this, he made haste in the morning, and went
        out with all the army of the city, and set it in battle array, toward the
        desert, not knowing that there lay an ambush behind his back.
      - But Josue, and all Israel gave back, making as if they were afraid, and fleeing
        by the way of the wilderness.
      - But they shouting together, and encouraging one another, pursued them. And
        when they were come from the city,
      - And not one remained in the city of Hai and of Bethel, that did not pursue
        after Israel, leaving the towns open as they had rushed out,
      - 'The Lord said to Josue: Lift up the shield that is in thy hand, towards the
        city of Hai, for I will deliver it to thee.'
      - 'And when he had lifted up his shield towards the city, the ambush, that lay
        hid, rose up immediately: and going to the city, took it, and set it on fire.'
      - 'And the men of the city, that pursued after Josue, looking back, and seeing
        the smoke of the city rise up to heaven, had no more power to flee this way
        or that way: especially as they that had counterfeited flight, and were going
        toward the wilderness, turned back most valiantly against them that pursued.'
      - So Josue, and all Israel, seeing that the city was taken, and that the smoke
        of the city rose up, returned, and slew the men of Hai.
      - And they also that had taken and set the city on fire, issuing out of the
        city to meet their own men, began to cut off the enemies who were surrounded
        by them. So that the enemies being cut off on both sides, not one of so great
        a multitude was saved.
      - And they took the king of the city of Hai alive and brought him to Josue.
      - So all being slain that had pursued after Israel, in his flight to the wilderness,
        and falling by the sword in the same place, the children of Israel returned
        and laid waste the city.
      - And the number of them that fell that day, both of men and women, was twelve
        thousand persons, all of the city of Hai.
      - But Josue drew not back his hand, which he had stretched out on high, holding
        the shield, till all the inhabitants of Hai were slain.
      - And the children of Israel divided among them, the cattle and the prey of
        the city, as the Lord had commanded Josue.
      - 'And he burnt the city, and made it a heap forever:'
      - 'And he hung the king thereof on a gibbet, until the evening and the going
        down of the sun. Then Josue commanded, and they took down his carcass from
        the gibbet: and threw it in the very entrance of the city, heaping upon it
        a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this present day.'
      - Then Josue built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, in Mount Hebal,
      - 'As Moses, the servant of the Lord, had commanded the children of Israel,
        and it is written in the book of the law of Moses: an altar of unhewn stones,
        which iron had not touched: and he offered upon it holocausts to the Lord,
        and immolated victims of peace offerings.'
      - And he wrote upon stones, the Deuteronomy of the law of Moses, which he had
        ordered before the children of Israel.
      - And all the people, and the ancients, and the princes, and judges, stood on
        both sides of the ark, before the priests that carried the ark of the covenant
        of the Lord, both the stranger and he that was born among them, half of them
        by Mount Garizim, and half by Mount Hebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord,
        had commanded. And first he blessed the people of Israel.
      - After this, he read all the words of the blessing and the cursing, and all
        things that were written in the book of the law.
      - He left out nothing of those things which Moses had commanded, but he repeated
        all before all the people of Israel, with the women and children, and strangers,
        that dwelt among them.

        on the coasts of the great sea, they also that dwell by Libanus, the Hethite,
        and the Amorrhite, the Chanaanite, the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the
        Jebusite,
      - Gathered themselves together, to fight against Josue and Israel with one mind,
        and one resolution.
      - 'But they that dwelt in Gabaon, hearing all that Josue had done to Jericho
        and Hai:'
      - Cunningly devising took for themselves provisions, laying old sacks upon their
        asses, and wine bottles rent and sewed up again,
      - 'And very old shoes, which for a show of age were clouted with patches, and
        old garments upon them: the loaves also, which they carried for provisions
        by the way, were hard, and broken into pieces:'
      - 'And they went to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to
        him, and to all Israel with him: We are come from a far country, desiring
        to make peace with you. And the children of Israel answered them, and said:'
      - Perhaps you dwell in the land which falls to our lot; if so, we can make no
        league with you.
      - 'But they said to Josue: We are thy servants. Josue said to them: Who are
        you? and whence came you?'
      - 'They answered: From a very far country thy servants are come in the name
        of the Lord thy God. For we have heard the fame of his power, all the things
        that he did in Egypt.'
      - 'And to the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan, Sehon,
        king of Hesebon, and Og, king of Basan, that was in Astaroth:'
      - 'And our ancients, and all the inhabitants of our country, said to us: Take
        with you victuals for a long way, and go meet them, and say: We are your servants,
        make ye a league with us.'
      - Behold, these loaves we took hot, when we set out from our houses to come
        to you, now they are become dry, and broken in pieces by being exceeding old.
      - These bottles of wine when we filled them were new, now they are rent and
        burst. These garments we have on, and the shoes we have on our feet, by reason
        of the very long journey, are worn out, and almost consumed.
      - They took therefore of their victuals, and consulted not the mouth of the
        Lord.
      - 'And Josue made peace with them, and entering into a league, promised that
        they should not be slain: the princes also of the multitude swore to them.'
      - Now three days after the league was made, they heard that they dwelt nigh,
        and they should be among them.
      - And the children of Israel removed the camp, and came into their cities on
        the third day, the names of which are, Gabaon, and Caphira, and Beroth, and
        Cariathiarim.
      - And they slew them not, because the princes of the multitude had sworn in
        the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. Then all the common people murmured
        against the princes.
      - 'And they answered them: We have sworn to them in the name of the Lord, the
        God of Israel, and therefore we may not touch them.'
      - 'But this we will do to them: Let their lives be saved, lest the wrath of
        the Lord be stirred up against us, if we should be forsworn:'
      - But so let them live, as to serve the whole multitude in hewing wood, and
        bringing in water. As they were speaking these things,
      - 'Josue called the Gabaonites, and said to them: Why would you impose upon
        us, saying: We dwell very far off from you, whereas you are in the midst of
        us?'
      - Therefore you shall be under a curse, and your race shall always be hewers
        of wood, and carriers of water, into the house of my God.
      - 'They answered: It was told us, thy servants, that the Lord thy God had promised
        his servant Moses, to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants
        thereof. Therefore we feared exceedingly and provided for our lives, compelled
        by the dread we had of you, and we took this counsel.'
      - 'And now we are in thy hand: deal with us as it seemeth good and right unto
        thee.'
      - So Josue did as he had said, and delivered them from the hand of the children
        of Israel, that they should not be slain.
      - And he gave orders in that day, that they should be in the service of all
        the people, and of the altar of the Lord, hewing wood, and carrying water,
        until this present time, in the place which the Lord hath chosen.

      - When Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, had heard these things, to wit, that Josue
        had taken Hai, and had destroyed it, (for as he had done to Jericho and the
        king thereof, so did he to Hai and its king) and that the Gabaonites were
        gone over to Israel, and were their confederates,
      - He was exceedingly afraid. For Gabaon was a great city, and one of the royal
        cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and all its fighting men were most
        valiant.
      - 'Therefore Adonisedec, king of Jerusalem, sent to Oham, king of Hebron, and
        to Pharam, king of Jerimoth, and to Japhia, king of Lachis, and to Dabir,
        king of Eglon, saying:'
      - Come up to me, and bring help, that we may take Gabaon, because it hath gone
        over to Josue, and to the children of Israel.
      - 'So the five kings of the Amorrhites being assembled together, went up: the
        king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis,
        the king of Eglon, they and their armies, and camped about Gabaon, laying
        siege to it.'
      - 'But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon, which was besieged, sent to Josue,
        who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him: Withdraw not thy hands
        from helping thy servants: come up quickly, and save us, and bring us succour:
        for all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwell in the mountains, are gathered
        together against us.'
      - And Josue went up from Galgal, and all the army of the warriors with him,
        most valiant men.
      - 'But the Lord said to Josue: Fear them not: for I have delivered them into
        thy hands: none of them shall be able to stand against thee.'
      - So Josue going up from Galgal all the night, came upon them suddenly.
      - 'And the Lord troubled them, at the sight of Israel: and he slew them with
        a great slaughter, in Gabaon, and pursued them by the way of the ascent to
        Bethoron, and cut them off all the way to Azeca and Maceda.'
      - 'And when they were fleeing from the children of Israel, and were in the descent
        of Bethoron, the Lord cast down upon them great stones from heaven, as far
        as Azeca: and many more were killed with the hailstones, than were slain by
        the swords of the children of Israel,'
      - 'Then Josue spoke to the Lord, in the day that he delivered the Amorrhite
        in the sight of the children of Israel, and he said before them: Move not,
        O sun, toward Gabaon, nor thou, O moon, toward the valley of Ajalon.'
      - And the sun and the moon stood still, till the people revenged themselves
        of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of the just? So the sun
        stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down the space of
        one day.
      - There was not before, nor after, so long a day, the Lord obeying the voice
        of a man, and fighting for Israel.
      - And Josue returned, with all Israel, into the camp of Galgal.
      - For the five kings were fled, and had hid themselves in a cave of the city
        of Maceda.
      - And it was told Josue, that the five kings were found hid in a cave of the
        city of Maceda.
      - 'And he commanded them that were with him, saying: Roll great stones to the
        mouth of the cave, and set careful men to keep them shut up:'
      - And stay you not, but pursue after the enemies, and kill all the hindermost
        of them as they flee, and do not suffer them whom the Lord God hath delivered
        into your hands, to shelter themselves in their cities.
      - So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter, and almost utterly consumed,
        they that were able to escape from Israel, entered into fenced cities.
      - 'And all the army returned to Josue, in Maceda, where the camp then was, in
        good health, and without the loss of any one: and no man durst move his tongue
        against the children of Israel.'

        remain until this day.
      - 'The same day Josue took Maceda, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword,
        and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof: he left not in it the

        of Jericho.'
      - 'And he passed from Maceda with all Israel to Lebna, and fought against it:'
      - 'And the Lord delivered it with the king thereof into the hands of Israel:
        and they destroyed the city with the edge of the sword, and all the inhabitants
        thereof. They left not in it any remains. And they did to the king of Lebna,
        as they had done to the king of Jericho.'
      - 'From Lebna he passed unto Lachis, with all Israel: and investing it with
        his army, besieged it.'

        following day, and put it to the sword, and every soul that was in it, as
        he had done to Lebna.

        him with all his people so as to leave none alive.'
      - And he passed from Lachis to Eglon, and surrounded it,
      - 'And took it the same day: and put to the sword all the souls that were in
        it, according to all that he had done to Lachis.'
      - 'He went up also with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron, and fought against
        it:'
      - 'Took it, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword: the king also thereof,
        and all the towns of that country, and all the souls that dwelt in it: he
        left not therein any remains: as he had done to Eglon, so did he also to Hebron,
        putting to the sword all that he found in it.'
      - Returning from thence to Dabir,
      - 'He took it, and destroyed it: the king also thereof, and all the towns round
        about, he destroyed with the edge of the sword: he left not in it any remains:
        as he had done to Hebron and Lebna, and to their kings, so did he to Dabir,
        and to the king thereof.'
      - 'So Josue conquered all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of
        the plain, and of Asedoth, with their kings: he left not any remains therein,

        you: you have also obeyed me in all things,'
      - Neither have you left your brethren this long time, until this present day,
        keeping the commandment of the Lord your God.
      - 'Therefore as the Lord your God hath given your brethren rest and peace, as
        he promised: return, and go to your dwellings, and to the land of your possession,
        which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan:'
      - 'Yet so that you observe attentively, and in work fulfil the commandment and
        the law which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you: that you love the
        Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, and keep all his commandments, and
        cleave to him, and serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul.'
      - And Josue blessed them, and sent them away, and they returned to their dwellings.
      - 'Now to half the tribe of Manasses, Moses had given a possession in Basan:
        and therefore to the half that remained, Josue gave a lot among the rest of
        their brethren beyond the Jordan to the west. And when he sent them away to
        their dwellings and had blessed them,'
      - 'He said to them: With much substance and riches, you return to your settlements,
        with silver and gold, brass and iron, and variety of raiment: divide the prey
        of your enemies with your brethren.'

        they built an altar immensely great near the Jordan.
      - 'And when the children of Israel had heard of it, and certain messengers brought
        them an account that the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and the half tribe
        of Manasses had built an altar in the land of Chanaan, upon the banks of the
        Jordan, over against the children of Israel:'
      - They all assembled in Silo, to go up and fight against them.
      - And in the mean time they sent to them into the land of Galaad, Phinees the
        son of Eleazar the priest,
      - And ten princes with him, one of every tribe.
      - 'Who came to the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses,
        into the land of Galaad, and said to them:'
      - 'Thus saith all the people of the Lord: What meaneth this transgression? Why
        have you forsaken the Lord the God of Israel, building a sacrilegious altar,
        and revolting from the worship of him?'
      - Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with Beelphegor, and the stain
        of that crime remaineth in us to this day? and many of the people perished.
      - And you have forsaken the Lord to day, and to morrow his wrath will rage against
        all Israel.
      - 'But if you think the land of your possession to be unclean, pass over to
        the land wherein is the tabernacle of the Lord, and dwell among us: only depart
        not from the Lord, and from our society, by building an altar beside the altar
        of the Lord our God.'
      - Did not Achan the son of Zare transgress the commandment of the Lord, and
        his wrath lay upon all the people of Israel? And he was but one man, and would
        to God he alone had perished in his wickedness.
      - 'And the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses
        answered the princes of the embassage of Israel:'
      - 'The Lord the most mighty God, the Lord the most mighty God, he knoweth, and
        Israel also shall understand: If with the design of transgression we have
        set up this altar, let him not save us, but punish us immediately:'
      - 'And if we did it with that mind, that we might lay upon it holocausts, and
        sacrifice, and victims of peace offerings, let him require and judge:'
      - 'And not rather with this thought and design, that we should say: To morrow
        your children will say to our children: What have you to do with the Lord
        the God of Israel?'
      - 'The Lord hath put the river Jordan for a border between us and you, O ye
        children of Ruben, and ye children of Gad: and therefore you have no part
        in the Lord. And by this occasion your children shall turn away our children
        from the fear of the Lord. We therefore thought it best,'
      - 'And said: Let us build us an altar, not for holocausts, nor to offer victims,'
      - 'But for a testimony between us and you, and our posterity and yours, that
        we may serve the Lord, and that we may have a right to offer both holocausts,
        and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings: and that your children to morrow
        may not say to our children: You have no part in the Lord.'
      - 'And if they will say so, they shall answer them: Behold the altar of the
        Lord, which our fathers made, not for holocausts, nor for sacrifice, but for
        a testimony between us and you.'
      - God keep us from any such wickedness that we should revolt from the Lord,
        and leave off following his steps, by building an altar to offer holocausts,
        and sacrifices, and victims, beside the altar of the Lord our God, which is
        erected before his tabernacle.
      - 'And when Phinees the priest, and the princes of the embassage, who were with
        him, had heard this, they were satisfied: and they admitted most willingly
        the words of the children of Ruben, and Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses,'
      - 'And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said to them: Now we know that
        the Lord is with us, because you are not guilty of this revolt, and you have
        delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the Lord.'
      - And he returned with the princes from the children of Ruben and Gad, out of
        the land of Galaad, into the land of Chanaan, to the children of Israel, and
        brought them word again.
      - And the saying pleased all that heard it. And the children of Israel praised
        God, and they no longer said that they would go up against them, and fight,
        and destroy the land of their possession.
      - And the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad called the altar which
        they had built, Our testimony, that the Lord is God.

        you, you should swear by the name of their gods, and serve them, and adore
        them:'

      - And then the Lord God will take away before your eyes nations that are great
        and very strong, and no man shall be able to resist you.
      - 'One of you shall chase a thousand men of the enemies: because the Lord your
        God himself will fight for you, as he hath promised.'
      - This only take care of with all diligence, that you love the Lord your God.
      - 'But if you will embrace the errors of these nations that dwell among you,
        and make marriages with them, and join friendships:'
      - Know ye for a certainty that the Lord your God will not destroy them before
        your face, but they shall be a pit and a snare in your way, and a stumbling-block
        at your side, and stakes in your eyes, till he take you away and destroy you
        from off this excellent land, which he hath given you.
      - Behold this day I am going into the way of all the earth, and you shall know
        with all your mind that of all the words which the Lord promised to perform
        for you, not one hath failed,
      - 'Therefore as he hath fulfilled in deed, what he promised, and all things
        prosperous have come: so will he bring upon you all the evils he hath threatened,
