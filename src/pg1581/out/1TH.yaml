book_intro: 'Thessalonica was the capital of Macedonia, in which St. Paul, having
  preached the Gospel, converted some Jews and a great number of the Gentiles: but
  the unbelieving Jews, envying his success, raised such a commotion against him that
  he, and his companion, Sylvanus were obliged to quit the city. Afterwards he went
  to Athens, where he heard that the converts in Thessalonica were under a severe
  persecution, ever since his departure; and lest they should lose their fortitude,
  he sent Timothy to strengthen and comfort them in their sufferings. In the meantime
  St. Paul came to Corinth, where he wrote this first Epistle, and also the second
  to the Thessalonians, both in the same year, being the nineteenth after our Lord’s
  Ascension. These are the first of his Epistles in the order of time.'

        enduring of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ before God and our Father.'
      - 'Knowing, brethren, beloved of God, your election:'
      - 'For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only, but in power also: and
        in the Holy Ghost and in much fulness, as you know what manner of men we have
        been among you for your sakes.'
      - 'And you became followers of us and of the Lord: receiving the word in much
        tribulation, with joy of the Holy Ghost:'

      - 'For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia
        and in Achaia but also in every place: your faith which is towards God, is
        gone forth, so that we need not to speak any thing.'
      - 'For they themselves relate of us, what manner of entering in we had unto
        you: and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God.'
      - And to wait for his Son from heaven (whom he raised up from the dead), Jesus,
        who hath delivered us from the wrath to come.

    verses:
      - ~
      - 'For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance in unto you, that it was not
        in vain:'
      - But having suffered many things before and been shamefully treated, (as you
        know) at Philippi, we had confidence in our God, to speak unto you the gospel
        of God in much carefulness.
      - For our exhortation was not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deceit.
      - 'But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be committed to us:
        even so we speak, not as pleasing men but God, who proveth our hearts.'
      - 'For neither have we used at any time the speech of flattery, as you know:
        nor taken an occasion of covetousness (God is witness):'
      - Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others.
      - 'Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the apostles of Christ:
        but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse should cherish
        her children:'
      - 'So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the gospel of
        God but also our own souls: because you were become most dear unto us.'
      - 'For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, lest
        we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached among you the gospel of
        God.'
      - 'You are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and without blame
        we have been to you that have believed:'
      - As you know in what manner, entreating and comforting you (as a father doth
        his children),
      - We testified to every one of you that you would walk worthy of God, who hath
        called you unto his kingdom and glory.
      - 'Therefore, we also give thanks to God without ceasing: because, that when
        you had received of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not
        as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the word of God, who worketh in
        you that have believed.'
      - 'For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches of God which are
        in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same things from
        your own countrymen, even as they have from the Jews:'
      - Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and have persecuted us,
        and please not God, and are adversaries to all men;
      - 'Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill
        up their sins always: for the wrath of God is come upon them to the end.'
      - But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in sight, not
        in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
      - 'For we would have come unto you, I Paul indeed, once and again: but Satan
        hath hindered us.'
      - For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory? Are not you, in the presence
        of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
      - For you are our glory and joy.

    verses:
      - ~
      - For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to remain at Athens
        alone.
      - 'And we sent Timothy, our brother and the minister of God in the gospel of
        Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith:'
      - 'That no man should be moved in these tribulations: for yourselves know that
        we are appointed thereunto.'
      - 'For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should suffer tribulations:
        as also it is come to pass, and you know.'
      - 'For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your faith: lest
        perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you: and our labour should be
        made vain.'
      - 'But now when Timothy came to us from you and related to us your faith and
        charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see
        us as we also to see you:'
      - Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation,
        by your faith.
      - Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.
      - For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy wherewith we
        rejoice for you before our God,
      - Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face and may accomplish
        those things that are wanting to your faith?
      - Now God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto
        you.
      - 'And may the Lord multiply you and make you abound in charity towards one
        another and towards all men: as we do also towards you,'
      - To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before God and our Father,
        at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. Amen.

      - For the rest therefore, brethren, we pray and beseech you in the Lord Jesus
        that, as you have received from us, how you ought to walk and to please God,
        so also you would walk, that you may abound the more.
      - For you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord Jesus.
      - 'For this is the will of God, your sanctification: That you should abstain
        from fornication:'
      - That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification
        and honour,
      - 'Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that know not God:'
      - 'And that no man overreach nor circumvent his brother in business: because
        the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you before and
        have testified.'
      - For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto sanctification.
      - Therefore, he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man, but God, who
        also hath given his holy Spirit in us.
      - 'But as touching the charity of brotherhood, we have no need to write to you:
        for yourselves have learned of God to love one another.'
      - 'For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia. But we entreat
        you, brethren, that you abound more:'
      - 'And that you use your endeavour to be quiet: and that you do your own business
        and work with your own hands, as we commanded you: and that you walk honestly
        towards them that are without: and that you want nothing of any man’s.'
      - And we will not have you ignorant brethren, concerning them that are asleep,
        that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope.
      - 'For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again: even so them who have slept
        through Jesus, will God bring with him.'
      - For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who
        remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept.
      - 'For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment and with
        the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God: and the dead who are
        in Christ shall rise first.'
      - 'Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them
        in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air: and so shall we be always with
        the Lord.'
      - Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these words.

    verses:
      - ~
      - 'But of the times and moments, brethren, you need not, that we should write
        to you:'
      - For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord shall so come as a
        thief in the night.
      - 'For when they shall say: Peace and security; then shall sudden destruction
        come upon them, as the pains upon her that is with child, and they shall not
        escape.'
      - But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you
        as a thief.
      - 'For all you are the children of light and children of the day: we are not
        of the night nor of darkness.'
      - 'Therefore, let us not sleep, as others do: but let us watch, and be sober.'
      - For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunk, are drunk
        in the night.
      - But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the breast plate of faith
        and charity and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
      - 'For God hath not appointed us unto wrath: but unto the purchasing of salvation
        by our Lord Jesus Christ,'
      - 'Who died for us: that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with
        him.'
      - For which cause comfort one another and edify one another, as you also do.
      - And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labour among you and are over
        you in the Lord and admonish you;
      - That you esteem them more abundantly in charity, for their work’s sake. Have
        peace with them.
      - 'And we beseech you, brethren, rebuke the unquiet: comfort the feeble minded:
        support the weak: be patient towards all men.'

        is good towards each other and towards all men.'
      - Always rejoice.
      - Pray without ceasing.
      - In all things give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
        you all.
      - Extinguish not the spirit.
      - Despise not prophecies.
      - 'But prove all things: hold fast that which is good.'
      - From all appearance of evil refrain yourselves.
      - 'And may the God of peace himself sanctify you in all things: that your whole
        spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless in the coming of our Lord
        Jesus Christ.'
