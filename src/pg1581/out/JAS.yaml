book_intro: This Epistle is called Catholic or Universal, as formerly were also the
  two Epistles of St. Peter, the first of St. John and that of St. Jude, because they
  were not written to any peculiar people or particular person, but to the faithful
  in general. It was written by the apostle St. James, called the Less, who was also
  called the brother of our Lord, being his kinsman (for cousins german with the Hebrews
  were called brothers). He was the first Bishop of Jerusalem. In this Epistle are
  set forth many precepts appertaining to faith and morals; particularly, that faith
  without good works will not save a man and that true wisdom is given only from above.
  In the fifth chapter he publishes the sacrament of anointing the sick. It was written
  a short time before his martyrdom, about twenty-eight years after our Lord’s Ascension.

  - chapter_intro: The benefit of tribulations. Prayer with faith. God is the author
      of all good, but not of evil. We must be slow to anger and not hearers only,
      but doers of the word. Of bridling the tongue and of pure religion.

    verses:
      - ~
      - James, the servant of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes
        which are scattered abroad, greeting.
      - 'My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations:'
      - Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience
      - 'And patience hath a perfect work: that you may be perfect and entire, failing
        in nothing.'
      - But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God who giveth to all men abundantly
        and upbraideth not. And it shall be given him.
      - But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a
        wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.
      - Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
      - A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.
      - 'But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:'
      - 'And the rich, in his being low: because as the flower of the grass shall
        he pass away.'
      - 'For the sun rose with a burning heat and parched the grass: and the flower
        thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished. So also shall
        the rich man fade away in his ways.'
      - 'Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for, when he hath been proved,
        he shall receive the crown of life which God hath promised to them that love
        him.'
      - 'Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is
        not a tempter of evils: and he tempteth no man.'
      - But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.
      - Then, when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when
        it is completed, begetteth death.
      - Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.
      - Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the
        Father of lights, with whom there is no change nor shadow of alteration.
      - For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might
        be some beginning of his creature.
      - You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow
        to speak and slow to anger.
      - For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.
      - Wherefore, casting away all uncleanness and abundance of naughtiness, with
        meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
      - But be ye doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
      - For if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he shall be compared
        to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.
      - For he beheld himself and went his way and presently forgot what manner of
        man he was.
      - 'But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty and hath continued
        therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work: this man
        shall be blessed in his deed.'
      - And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue but
        deceiving his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.
      - 'Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit
        the fatherless and widows in their tribulation and to keep one’s self unspotted
        from this world.'

        raw: Guilty of all; ... That is, he becomes a transgressor of the law in such
          a manner, that the observing of all other points will not avail him to salvation;
          for he despises the lawgiver, and breaks through the great and general commandment
          of charity, even by one mortal sin. For all the precepts of the law are
          to be considered as one total and entire law, and as it were a chain of
          precepts, where, by breaking one link of this chain, the whole chain is
          broken, or the integrity of the law consisting of a collection of precepts.
          A sinner, therefore, by a grievous offence against any one precept, incurs
          eternal punishment; yet the punishment in hell shall be greater for those
          who have been greater sinners, as a greater reward shall be for those in
          heaven who have lived with greater sanctity and perfection.
    verses:
      - ~
      - My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory, with respect
        of persons.
      - 'For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in
        fine apparel; and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire:'
      - 'And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel and shall
        say to him: Sit thou here well: but say to the poor man: Stand thou there,
        or: Sit under my footstool:'
      - Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts?
      - 'Hearken, my dearest brethren: Hath not God chosen the poor in this world,
        rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that
        love him?'
      - But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might?
        And do not they draw you before the judgment seats?
      - Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?
      - 'If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures: Thou shalt
        love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.'
      - But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the
        law as transgressors.
      - And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become
        guilty of all.
      - 'For he that said: Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also: Thou shalt not
        kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become
        a transgressor of the law.'
      - So speak ye and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.
      - For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth
        itself above judgment.
      - What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not
        works? Shall faith be able to save him?
      - 'And if a brother or sister be naked and want daily food:'
      - 'And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give
        them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?'
      - So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.
      - 'But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works. Shew me thy faith
        without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.'
      - 'Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe
        and tremble.'
      - But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
      - Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon
        the altar?
      - Seest thou that faith did cooperate with his works and by works faith was
        made perfect?
      - 'And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was
        reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.'
      - Do you see that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only?
      - And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works,
        receiving the messengers and sending them out another way?
      - 'For even as the body without the spirit is dead: so also faith without works
        is dead.'
  - chapter_intro: Of the evils of the tongue. Of the difference between the earthly
      and heavenly wisdom.
    chapter_number: 3
    verses:
      - ~
      - Be ye not many masters, my brethren, knowing that you receive the greater
        judgment.
      - For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, the same
        is a perfect man. He is able also with a bridle to lead about the whole body.
      - 'For if we put bits into the mouths of horses, that they may obey us: and
        we turn about their whole body.'
      - Behold also ships, whereas they are great and are driven by strong winds,
        yet are they turned about with a small helm, whithersoever the force of the
        governor willeth.
      - Even so the tongue is indeed a little member and boasteth great things. Behold
        how small a fire kindleth a great wood.
      - And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is placed among
        our members, which defileth the whole body and inflameth the wheel of our
        nativity, being set on fire by hell.
      - For every nature of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of the rest is
        tamed and hath been tamed, by the nature of man.
      - But the tongue no man can tame, an unquiet evil, full of deadly poison.
      - 'By it we bless God and the Father: and by it we curse men who are made after
        the likeness of God.'
      - Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these
        things ought not so to be.
      - Doth a fountain send forth, out of the same hole, sweet and bitter water?
      - Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear grapes? Or the vine, figs? So neither
        can the salt water yield sweet.
      - Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge, among you? Let him shew, by a
        good conversation, his work in the meekness of wisdom.
      - 'But if you have bitter zeal, and there be contentions in your hearts: glory
        not and be not liars against the truth.'
      - 'For this is not wisdom, descending from above: but earthly, sensual, devilish.'
      - 'For where envying and contention is: there is inconstancy and every evil
        work.'
      - But the wisdom that is from above, first indeed is chaste, then peaceable,
        modest, easy to be persuaded, consenting to the good, full of mercy and good
        fruits, without judging, without dissimulation.
      - And the fruit of justice is sown in peace, to them that make peace.
  - chapter_intro: The evils that flow from yielding to concupiscence and being friends
      to this world. Admonitions against pride, detraction and the like.
    chapter_number: 4
    verses:
      - ~
      - From whence are wars and contentions among you? Are they not hence, from your
        concupiscences, which war in your members?
      - 'You covet, and have not: you kill and envy and cannot obtain. You contend
        and war, and you have not: because you ask not.'
      - 'You ask and receive not: because you ask amiss, that you may consume it on
        your concupiscences.'
      - Adulterers, know you not that the friendship of this world is the enemy of
        God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world becometh an enemy
        of God.
      - 'Or do you think that the scripture saith in vain: To envy doth the spirit
        covet which dwelleth in you?'
      - 'But he giveth greater grace. Wherefore he saith: God resisteth the proud
        and giveth grace to the humble.'
      - 'Be subject therefore to God. But resist the devil: and he will fly from you.'
      - 'Draw nigh to God: and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners,
        and purify your hearts, ye double minded.'
      - 'Be afflicted and mourn and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning
        and your joy into sorrow.'
      - 'Be humbled in the sight of the Lord: and he will exalt you.'
      - Detract not one another, my brethren. He that detracteth his brother, or he
        that judgeth his brother, detracteth the law and judgeth the law. But if thou
        judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
      - There is one lawgiver and judge, that is able to destroy and to deliver.
      - 'But who art thou that judgest thy neighbour? Behold, now you that say: To-day
        or to-morrow we will go into such a city, and there we will spend a year and
        will traffic and make our gain.'
      - Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow.
      - 'For what is your life? It is a vapour which appeareth for a little while
        and afterwards shall vanish away. For that you should say: If the Lord will,
        and, If we shall live, we will do this or that.'
      - But now you rejoice in your arrogancies. All such rejoicing is wicked.
      - To him therefore who knoweth to do good and doth it not, to him it is sin.
