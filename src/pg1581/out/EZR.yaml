    verse:
      - ~
      - 'In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the word of the Lord
        by the mouth of Jeremias might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit
        of Cyrus king of the Persians: and he made a proclamation throughout all his
        kingdom, and in writing also, saying:'
      - 'Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians: The Lord the God of heaven hath given
        to me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he hath charged me to build him a
        house in Jerusalem, which is in Judea.'
      - 'Who is there among you of all his people? His God be with him. Let him go
        up to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord the God
        of Israel: he is the God that is in Jerusalem.'
      - And let all the rest in all places wheresoever they dwell, help him every
        man from his place, with silver and gold, and goods, and cattle, besides that
        which they offer freely to the temple of God, which is in Jerusalem.
      - Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Juda and Benjamin, and the priests,
        and Levites, and every one whose spirit God had raised up, to go up to build
        the temple of the Lord, which was in Jerusalem.
      - And all they that were round about, helped their hands with vessels of silver,
        and gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with furniture, besides what they
        had offered on their own accord.
      - And king Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the temple of the Lord, which
        Nabuchodonosor had taken from Jerusalem, and had put them in the temple of
        his god.
      - Now Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of Mithridates the
        son of Gazabar, and numbered them to Sassabasar the prince of Juda.
      - 'And this is the number of them: thirty bowls of gold, a thousand bowls of
        silver, nine and twenty knives, thirty cups of gold,'
      - 'Silver cups of a second sort, four hundred and ten: other vessels a thousand.'
      - 'All the vessels of gold and silver, five thousand four hundred: all these
        Sassabasar brought with them that came up from the captivity of Babylon to
        Jerusalem.'

      - 'And now the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in their

      - And Josue the son of Josedec rose up, and his brethren the priests, and Zorobabel
        the son of Salathiel, and his brethren, and they built the altar of the God
        of Israel that they might offer holocausts upon it, as it is written in the
        law of Moses the man of God.
      - And they set the altar of God upon its bases, while the people of the lands
        round about put them in fear, and they offered upon it a holocaust to the
        Lord morning and evening.
      - And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the
        holocaust every day orderly according to the commandment, the duty of the
        day in its day.
      - And afterwards the continual holocaust, both on the new moons, and on all
        the solemnities of the Lord, that were consecrated, and on all in which a
        freewill offering was made to the Lord.
      - 'From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer holocausts to
        the Lord: but the temple of God was not yet founded.'
      - 'And they gave money to hewers of stones and to masons: and meat and drink,
        and oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians, to bring cedar trees from Libanus to
        the sea of Joppe, according to the orders which Cyrus king of the Persians
        had given them.'
      - And in the second year of their coming to the temple of God in Jerusalem,
        the second month, Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue the son of Josedec,
        and the rest of their brethren the priests, and the Levites, and all that
        were come from the captivity to Jerusalem began, and they appointed Levites
        from twenty years old and upward, to hasten forward the work of the Lord.
      - 'Then Josue and his sons and his brethren, Cedmihel, and his sons, and the
        children of Juda, as one man, stood to hasten them that did the work in the
        temple of God: the sons of Henadad, and their sons, and their brethren the
        Levites.'
      - 'And when the masons laid the foundations of the temple of the Lord, the priests
        stood in their ornaments with trumpets: and the Levites the sons of Asaph
        with cymbals, to praise God by the hands of David king of Israel.'
      - 'And they sung together hymns, and praise to the Lord: because he is good,
        for his mercy endureth for ever towards Israel. And all the people shouted
        with a great shout, praising the Lord, because the foundations of the temple
        of the Lord were laid.'
      - 'But many of the priests and the Levites, and the chief of the fathers and
        the ancients that had seen the former temple; when they had the foundation
        of this temple before their eyes, wept with a loud voice: and many shouting
        for joy, lifted up their voice.'
      - 'So that one could not distinguish the voice of the shout of joy, from the
        noise of the weeping of the people: for one with another the people shouted
        with a loud shout, and the voice was heard afar off.'

    verse:
      - ~
      - Now the enemies of Juda and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity
        were building a temple to the Lord the God of Israel.
      - 'And they came to Zorobabel, and the chief of the fathers, and said to them:
        Let us build with you, for we seek your God as ye do: behold we have sacrificed
        to him, since the days of Asor Haddan king of Assyria, who brought us hither.'
      - 'But Zorobabel, and Josue, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel
        said to them: You have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God,
        but we ourselves alone will build to the Lord our God, as Cyrus king of the
        Persians hath commanded us.'
      - Then the people of the land hindered the hands of the people of Juda, and
        troubled them in building.
      - And they hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their design all the
        days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of the Persians.
      - And in the reign of Assuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an
        accusation against the inhabitants of Juda and Jerusalem.
      - 'And in the days of Artaxerxes, Beselam, Mithridates, and Thabeel, and the
        rest that were in the council wrote to Artaxerxes king of the Persians: and
        the letter of accusation was written in Syrian, and was read in the Syrian
        tongue.'
      - 'Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the scribe wrote a letter from Jerusalem to king
        Artaxerxes, in this manner:'
      - Reum Beelteem, and Samsai the scribe and the rest of their counsellors, the
        Dinites, and the Apharsathacites, the Therphalites, the Apharsites, the Erchuites,
        the Babylonians, the Susanechites, the Dievites, and the Elamites,
      - 'And the rest of the nations, whom the great and glorious Asenaphar brought
        over: and made to dwell in the cities of Samaria and in the rest of the countries
        of this side of the river in peace.'
      - (This is the copy of the letter, which they sent to him:) To Artaxerxes the
        king, thy servants, the men that are on this side of the river, send greeting.
      - Be it known to the king, that the Jews, who came up from thee to us, are come
        to Jerusalem a rebellious and wicked city, which they are building, setting
        up the ramparts thereof and repairing the walls.
      - And now be it known to the king, that if this city be built up, and the walls
        thereof repaired, they will not pay tribute nor toll, nor yearly revenues,
        and this loss will fall upon the kings.
      - But we remembering the salt that we have eaten in the palace, and because
        we count it a crime to see the king wronged, have therefore sent and certified
        the king,
      - 'That search may be made in the books of the histories of thy fathers, and
        thou shalt find written in the records: and shalt know that this city is a
        rebellious city, and hurtful to the kings and provinces, and that wars were
        raised therein of old time: for which cause also the city was destroyed.'
      - We certify the king, that if this city be built, and the walls thereof repaired,
        thou shalt have no possession on this side of the river.
      - The king sent word to Reum Beelteem and Samsai the scribe, and to the rest
        that were in their council, inhabitants of Samaria, and to the rest beyond
        the river, sending greeting and peace.
      - The accusation, which you have sent to us, hath been plainly read before me,
      - 'And I commanded: and search hath been made, and it is found, that this city
        of old time hath rebelled against kings, and seditions and wars have been
        raised therein.'
      - 'For there have been powerful kings in Jerusalem, who have had dominion over
        all the country that is beyond the river: and have received tribute, and toll
        and revenues.'
      - 'Now therefore hear the sentence: Hinder those men, that this city be not
        built, till further orders be given by me.'
      - See that you be not negligent in executing this, lest by little and little
        the evil grow to the hurt of the kings.
      - 'Now the copy of the edict of king Artaxerxes was read before Reum Beelteem,
        and Samsai the scribe, and their counsellors: and they went up in haste to
        Jerusalem to the Jews, and hindered them with arm and power.'
      - Then the work of the house of the Lord in Jerusalem was interrupted, and ceased
        till the second year of the reign of Darius king of the Persians.

      - Now Aggeus the prophet, and Zacharias the son of Addo, prophesied to the Jews
        that were in Judea and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel.
      - Then rose up Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue the son of Josedec,
        and began to build the temple of God in Jerusalem, and with them were the
        prophets of God helping them.
      - 'And at the same time came to them Thathanai, who was governor beyond the
        river, and Stharbuzanai, and their counsellors: and said thus to them: Who
        hath given you counsel to build this house, and to repair the walls thereof?'
      - In answer to which we gave them the names of the men who were the promoters
        of that building.
      - But the eye of their God was upon the ancients of the Jews, and they could
        not hinder them. And it was agreed that the matter should be referred to Darius,
        and then they should give satisfaction concerning that accusation.
      - The copy of the letter that Thathanai governor of the country beyond the river,
        and Stharbuzanai, and his counsellors the Arphasachites, who dwelt beyond
        the river, sent to Darius the king.
      - 'The letter which they sent him, was written thus: To Darius the king all
        peace.'
      - 'Be it known to the king, that we went to the province of Judea, to the house
        of the great God, which they are building with unpolished stones, and timber
        is laid in the walls: and this work is carried on diligently and advanceth
        in their hands.'
      - 'And we asked those ancients, and said to them thus: Who hath given you authority
        to build this house, and to repair these walls?'
      - 'We asked also of them their names, that we might give thee notice: and we
        have written the names of the men that are the chief among them.'
      - 'And they answered us in these words, saying: We are the servants of the God
        of heaven and earth, and we are building a temple that was built these many
        years ago, and which a great king of Israel built and set up.'
      - 'But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he delivered
        them into the hands of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon the Chaldean: and
        he destroyed this house, and carried away the people to Babylon.'
      - But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, king Cyrus set forth a
        decree, that this house of God should be built.
      - And the vessels also of gold and silver of the temple of God, which Nabuchodonosor
        had taken out of the temple, that was in Jerusalem, and had brought them to
        the temple of Babylon, king Cyrus brought out of the temple of Babylon, and
        they were delivered to one Sassabasar, whom also he appointed governor,
      - 'And said to him: Take these vessels, and go, and put them in the temple that
        is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.'
      - Then came this same Sassabasar, and laid the foundations of the temple of
        God in Jerusalem, and from that time until now it is in building, and is not
        yet finished.
      - Now therefore if it seem good to the king, let him search in the king’s library,
        which is in Babylon, whether it hath been decreed by Cyrus the king, that
        the house of God in Jerusalem should be built, and let the king send his pleasure
        to us concerning this matter.

    verse:
      - ~
      - Then king Darius gave orders, and they searched in the library of the books
        that were laid up in Babylon,
      - And there was found in Ecbatana, which is a castle in the province of Media,
        a book in which this record was written.
      - 'In the first year of Cyrus the king: Cyrus the king decreed, that the house
        of God should be built, which is in Jerusalem, in the place where they may
        offer sacrifices, and that they lay the foundations that may support the height
        of threescore cubits, and the breadth of threescore cubits,'
      - 'Three rows of unpolished stones, and so rows of new timber: and the charges
        shall be given out of the king’s house.'
      - And also let the golden and silver vessels of the temple of God, which Nabuchodonosor
        took out of the temple of Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored,
        and carried back to the temple of Jerusalem to their place, which also were
        placed in the temple of God.
      - Now therefore Thathanai, governor of the country beyond the river, Stharbuzanai,
        and your counsellors the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, depart far
        from them,
      - And let that temple of God be built by the governor of the Jews, and by their
        ancients, that they may build that house of God in its place.
      - I also have commanded what must be done by those ancients of the Jews, that
        the house of God may be built, to wit, that of the king’s chest, that is,
        of the tribute that is paid out of the country beyond the river, the charges
        be diligently given to those men, lest the work be hindered.
      - And if it shall be necessary, let calves also, and lambs, and kids, for holocausts
        to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the custom
        of the priests that are in Jerusalem, be given them day by day, that there
        be no complaint in any thing.
      - And let them offer oblations to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of
        the king, and of his children.
      - 'And I have made a decree: That if any whosoever, shall alter this commandment,
        a beam be taken from his house, and set up, and he be nailed upon it, and
        his house be confiscated.'

        and the people that shall put out their hand to resist, and to destroy the
        house of God, that is in Jerusalem. I Darius have made the decree, which I
        will have diligently complied with.
      - So then Thathanai, governor of the country beyond the river, and Stharbuzanai,
        and his counsellors diligently executed what Darius the king had commanded.
      - 'And the ancients of the Jews built, and prospered according to the prophecy
        of Aggeus the prophet, and of Zacharias the son of Addo: and they built and
        finished, by the commandment of the God of Israel, and by the commandment
        of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes kings of the Persians.'
      - And they were finishing this house of God, until the third day of the month
        of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of king Darius.
      - And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the
        children of the captivity kept the dedication of the house of God with joy.
      - And they offered at the dedication of the house of God, a hundred calves,
        two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a sin offering for all Israel
        twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
      - And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses
        over the works of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
      - And the children of Israel of the captivity kept the phase, on the fourteenth
        day of the first month.
      - 'For all the priests and the Levites were purified as one man: all were clean
        to kill the phase for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren
        the priests, and themselves.'
      - And the children of Israel that were returned from captivity, and all that
        had separated themselves from the filthiness of the nations of the earth to
        them, to seek the Lord the God of Israel, did eat.
      - And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy, for the Lord
        had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them,
        that he should help their hands in the work of the house of the Lord the God
        of Israel.

      - ~
      - Now after these things in the reign of Artaxerxes king of the Persians, Esdras
        the son of Saraias, the son of Azarias, the son of Helcias,
      - The son of Sellum, the son of Sadoc, the son of Achitob,
      - The son of Amarias, the son of Azarias, the son of Maraioth,
      - The son of Zarahias, the son of Ozi, the son of Bocci,
      - The son of Abisue, the son of Phinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron,
        the priest from the beginning.
      - 'This Esdras went up from Babylon, and he was a ready scribe in the law of
        Moses, which the Lord God had given to Israel: and the king granted him all
        his request, according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him.'
      - And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the children of the
        priests, and of the children of the Levites, and of the singing men, and of
        the porters, and of the Nathinites to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes
        the king.
      - And they came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, in the seventh year of the
        king.
      - For upon the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylon,
        and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem according to
        the good hand of his God upon him.
      - For Esdras had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do and
        to teach in Israel the commandments and judgment.
      - And this is the copy of the letter of the edict, which king Artaxerxes gave
        to Esdras the priest, the scribe instructed in the words and commandments
        of the Lord, and his ceremonies in Israel.
      - Artaxerxes king of kings to Esdras the priest, the most learned scribe of
        the law of the God of heaven, greeting.
      - It is decreed by me, that all they of the people of Israel, and of the priests
        and of the Levites in my realm, that are minded to go into Jerusalem, should
        go with thee.
      - For thou art sent from before the king, and his seven counsellors, to visit
        Judea and Jerusalem according to the law of thy God, which is in thy hand.
      - And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have
        freely offered to the God of Israel, whose tabernacle is in Jerusalem.
      - And all the silver and gold that thou shalt find in all the province of Babylon,
        and that the people is willing to offer, and that the priests shall offer
        of their own accord to the house of their God, which is in Jerusalem,
      - Take freely, and buy diligently with this money, calves, rams, lambs, with
        the sacrifices and libations of them, and offer them upon the altar of the
        temple of your God, that is in Jerusalem.
      - And if it seem good to thee, and to thy brethren to do any thing with the
        rest of the silver and gold, do it according to the will of your God.
      - The vessels also, that are given thee for the sacrifice of the house of thy
        God, deliver thou in the sight of God in Jerusalem.
      - And whatsoever more there shall be need of for the house of thy God, how much
        soever thou shalt have occasion to spend, it shall be given out of the treasury,
        and the king’s exchequer, and by me.
      - I Artaxerxes the king have ordered and decreed to all the keepers of the public
        chest, that are beyond the river, that whatsoever Esdras the priest, the scribe
        of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, you give it without
        delay,
      - Unto a hundred talents of silver, and unto a hundred cores of wheat, and unto
        a hundred bates of wine, and unto a hundred bates of oil, and salt without
        measure.
      - 'All that belongeth to the rites of the God of heaven, let it be given diligently
        in the house of the God of heaven: lest his wrath should be enkindled against
        the realm of the king, and of his sons.'
      - We give you also to understand concerning all the priests, and the Levites,
        and the singers, and the porters, and the Nathinites, and ministers of the
        house of this God, that you have no authority to impose toll or tribute, or
        custom upon them.
      - And thou Esdras according to the wisdom of thy God, which is in thy hand,
        appoint judges and magistrates, that may judge all the people, that is beyond
        the river, that is, for them who know the law of thy God, yea and the ignorant
        teach ye freely.
      - And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king diligently,
        judgment shall be executed upon him, either unto death, or unto banishment,
        or to the confiscation of goods, or at least to prison.
      - Blessed be the Lord the God of our fathers, who hath put this in the king’s
        heart, to glorify the house of the Lord, which is in Jerusalem,
      - 'And hath inclined his mercy toward me before the king and his counsellors,
        and all the mighty princes of the king: and I being strengthened by the hand
        of the Lord my God, which was upon me, gathered together out of Israel chief
        men to go up with me.'

      - 'So I sent Eliezer, and Ariel, and Semeias, and Elnathan, and Jarib, and another
        Elnathan, and Nathan, and Zacharias, and Mosollam, chief men: and Joiarib,
        and Elnathan, wise men.'
      - And I sent them to Eddo, who is chief in the place of Chasphia, and I put
        in their mouth the words that they should speak to Eddo, and his brethren
        the Nathinites in the place of Chasphia, that they should bring us ministers
        of the house of our God.
      - And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a most learned man

        his sons, and his brethren eighteen,

        the Levites, Nathinites two hundred and twenty: all these were called by their

        before the Lord our God, and might ask of him a right way for us and for our
        children, and for all our substance.
      - 'For I was ashamed to ask the king for aid and for horsemen, to defend us
        from the enemy in the way: because we had said to the king: The hand of our
        God is upon all them that seek him in goodness: and his power and strength,
        and wrath upon all them that forsake him.'
      - 'And we fasted, and besought our God for this: and it fell out prosperously

        and with them ten of their brethren,

        the house of our God, which the king and his counsellors, and his princes,
        and all Israel, that were found had offered.
      - And I weighed to their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and
        a hundred vessels of silver, and a hundred talents of gold,

        shining brass, beautiful as gold.

        holy, and the silver and gold, that is freely offered to the Lord the God

        the priests, and of the Levites, and the heads of the families of Israel in
        Jerusalem, into the treasure of the house of the Lord.
      - And the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and gold,

      - 'Then we set forward from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first
        month to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and delivered
        us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.'
      - And we came to Jerusalem, and we stayed there three days.
      - And on the fourth day the silver and the gold, and the vessels were weighed
        in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Urias the priest,

      - 'And after these things were accomplished, the princes came to me, saying:
        The people of Israel, and the priests and Levites have not separated themselves
        from the people of the lands, and from their abominations, namely, of the
        Chanaanites, and the Hethites, and the Pherezites, and the Jebusites, and
        the Ammonites, and the Moabites, and the Egyptians, and the Amorrhites.'
      - For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons,
        and they have mingled the holy seed with the people of the lands. And the
        hand of the princes and magistrates hath been first in this transgression.
      - And when I had heard this word, I rent my mantle and my coat, and plucked
        off the hairs of my head and my beard, and I sat down mourning.
      - And there were assembled to me all that feared the God of Israel, because
        of the transgression of those that were come from the captivity, and I sat
        sorrowful, until the evening sacrifice.
      - And at the evening sacrifice I rose up from my affliction, and having rent
        my mantle and my garment, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands to
        the Lord my God,
      - 'And said: My God I am confounded and ashamed to lift up my face to thee:
        for our iniquities are multiplied over our heads, and our sins are grown up
        even unto heaven,'
      - 'From the days of our fathers: and we ourselves also have sinned grievously
        unto this day, and for our iniquities we and our kings, and our priests have
        been delivered into the hands of the kings of the lands, and to the sword,
        and to captivity, and to spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is at this
        day.'
      - And now as a little, and for a moment has our prayer been made before the
        Lord our God, to leave us a remnant, and give us a pin in his holy place,
        and that our God would enlighten our eyes, and would give us a little life
        in our bondage.
      - For we are bondmen, and in our bondage our God hath not forsaken us, but hath
        extended mercy upon us before the king of the Persians, to give us life, and
        to set up the house of our God, and to rebuild the desolations thereof, and
        to give us a fence in Juda and Jerusalem.
      - And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy
        commandments,
      - 'Which thou hast commanded by the hand of thy servants the prophets, saying:
        The land which you go to possess, is an unclean land, according to the uncleanness
        of the people, and of other lands, with their abominations, who have filled
        it from mouth to mouth with their filth.'

        for your sons, and seek not their peace, nor their prosperity for ever: that
        you may be strengthened, and may eat the good things of the land, and may
        have your children your heirs for ever.'
      - And after all that is come upon us, for our most wicked deeds, and our great
        sin, seeing that thou our God hast saved us from our iniquity, and hast given
        us a deliverance as at this day,
      - That we should not turn away, nor break thy commandments, nor join in marriage
        with the people of these abominations. Art thou angry with us unto utter destruction,
        not to leave us a remnant to be saved?
      - 'O Lord God of Israel, thou art just: for we remain yet to be saved as at
        this day. Behold we are before thee in our sin, for there can be no standing

      - Now when Esdras was thus praying, and beseeching, and weeping, and lying before
        the temple of God, there was gathered to him of Israel an exceeding great
        assembly of men and women and children, and the people wept with much lamentation.
      - 'And Sechenias the son of Jehiel of the sons of Elam answered, and said to
        Esdras: We have sinned against our God, and have taken strange wives of the
        people of the land: and now if there be repentance in Israel concerning this,'
      - 'Let us make a covenant with the Lord our God, to put away all the wives,
        and such as are born of them, according to the will of the Lord, and of them
        that fear the commandment of the Lord our God: let it be done according to
        the law.'
      - 'Arise, it is thy part to give orders, and we will be with thee: take courage,
        and do it.'
      - So Esdras arose, and made the chiefs of the priests and of the Levites, and
        all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word, and they swore.
      - 'And Esdras rose up from before the house of God, and went to the chamber
        of Johanan the son of Eliasib, and entered in thither: he ate no bread, and
        drank no water: for he mourned for the transgression of them that were come
        out of the captivity.'
      - And proclamation was made in Juda and Jerusalem to all the children of the
        captivity, that they should assemble together into Jerusalem.
      - And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel
        of the princes and the ancients, all his substance should be taken away, and
        he should be cast out of the company of them that were returned from captivity.

        within three days, in the ninth month, the twentieth day of the month: and
        all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of
        the sin, and the rain.'
      - 'And Esdras the priest stood up, and said to them: You have transgressed,
        and taken strange wives, to add to the sins of Israel.'
      - And now make confession to the Lord the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure,
        and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from your strange
        wives.
      - 'And all the multitude answered and said with a loud voice: According to thy
        word unto us, so be it done.'
      - But as the people are many, and it is time of rain, and we are not able to
        stand without, and it is not a work of one day or two, (for we have exceedingly
        sinned in this matter,)
      - 'Let rulers be appointed in all the multitude: and in all our cities, let
        them that have taken strange wives come at the times appointed, and with them
        the ancients and the judges of every city, until the wrath of our God be turned
        away from us for this sin.'
      - 'Then Jonathan the son of Azahel, and Jaasia the son of Thecua were appointed
        over this, and Mesollam and Sebethai, Levites, helped them:'
      - And the children of the captivity did so. And Esdras the priest, and the men
        heads of the families in the houses of their fathers, and all by their names,
        went and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
      - And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the
        first day of the first month.
      - 'And there were found among the sons of the priests that had taken strange
        wives: Of the sons of Josue the son of Josedec, and his brethren, Maasia,
        and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Godolia.'
